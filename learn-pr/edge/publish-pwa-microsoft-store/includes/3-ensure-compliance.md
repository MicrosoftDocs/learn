Before you publish your PWA to the Microsoft Store, you need to ensure it aligns with our guidelines and requirements. 

## Confirm web app manifest specifications

The web app manifest is a JSON file that provides crucial information about your app to the browser. It allows your PWA to behave more like a native app.

Ensure that your web app manifest is correctly structured and includes all the necessary attributes. You can use PWABuilder site to correct any errors and warnings.

## Confirm service worker API standards

Service workers are scripts that your browser runs in the background, separate from a web page. They enable features that don't need a web page or user interaction, like push notifications and background sync. Make sure your service worker meets the standards.

## Review store policies and code of conduct

In addition to technical specifications, your PWA must also align with the relevant [store policies and code of conduct](/windows/apps/publish/store-policies-and-code-of-conduct). Regularly review these policies to ensure that your application remains in compliance.
