In this exercise, you'll have the opportunity to practice evaluating a website's PWA readiness using PWABuilder. 

## Evaluate a website's PWA readiness

You can use your own website or use the example case provided in step 2 below.

1. Open your browser and navigate to **PWABuilder**.
1. Enter the link to your web app. If you don't have a web app, use: <https://webboard.app/> for the link.
1. Select **Start** to generate a readiness report for the example website.
1. For this activity, review the generated report and pay attention to the action items.
1. Select the ℹ️ icon next to each action item to get more information about an error or warning.
1. If you're using your own website, determine the next steps needed to improve the website's PWA readiness.
1. Implement the changes for at least the warnings.

## Validate your changes

After you generate the readiness report, your action items should look something like this:

Action items should look like this in an open state, preferably without warnings:

:::image type="content" source="../media/list-of-action-items.png" alt-text="Screenshot of PWABuilder's report card page that shows a list of the action items identified in the readiness report.":::

Make sure to check the warnings and errors. They should be addressed before packaging the web app for app stores.
