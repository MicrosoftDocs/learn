  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
    - content: What *isn't* a difference between controller-based APIs and minimal APIs?
      choices:
        - content: All startup code happens in *Program.cs*.
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: Correct. Startup code is in *Program.cs* in both types of API.
        - content: Requests are primarily mapped to controllers and decorators for controller-based APIs.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. This request mapping is a difference between the two approaches.
        - content: Model binding uses decorators to get body data.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. This model binding detail is a difference between the two approaches. There's no need for decorators to get body data for a minimal API.
    - content: What is the correct way to create a minimal API?
      choices:
        - content: Enter `dotnet new webapi`.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. That code is used to create a controller-based API.
        - content: Enter `dotnet new web`.
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: Correct. That's the correct code to use to create a minimal API.
        - content: Enter `dotnet new minimalapi`.
          explanation: Incorrect. There's no template with that name.
          isCorrect: false
    - content: What's the correct way to set up a route in minimal API?
      choices:
        - content: Enter `ActionResult Get() {}`.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. That code is how you can type in a controller-based API if this method is in a controller class.
        - content: Enter `app.Get("/pizza", () => /**/)`.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. Use a method preceded with `Map` plus the name of the verb, for example, `MapGet()`.
        - content: Enter `app.MapGet("/pizza", () => /**/)`.
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: Correct. Using this code is the correct way to set up a route in minimal API.
