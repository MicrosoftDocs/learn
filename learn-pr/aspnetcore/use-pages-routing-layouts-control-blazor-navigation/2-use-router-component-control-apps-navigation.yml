  questions:
    - content: "What component should you use to get URI location information inside of a Blazor component?"
      choices:
      - content: "RouteManager"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "This isn't a real object in the Blazor framework."
      - content: "NavigationManager"
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "NavigationManager allows you to get the full URI, a relative URI, and querystring information as the user interacts with the component."
      - content: "ServiceLocator"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "The ServiceLocator is used to inject services into a component or class, not URI information."
    - content: "What is the default CSS class added to an anchor tag by the NavLink component when NavLink is referencing the current URL?"
      choices:
      - content: "`current`"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "The default CSS class assigned by the NavLink component isn't `current`. You _could_ configure the NavLink ActiveClass property to specify current as the class to assign."
      - content: "`live`"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "The default CSS class assigned by the NavLink component isn't `live`. You _could_ configure the NavLink ActiveClass property to specify live as the class to assign."
      - content: "`active`"
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "The default class added by the NavLink component is `active`. You can customize a link with different formatting when that link points to the current URL."
