  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
    - content: "Which is the correct format to use a route parameter to capture a portion of the URL that defines the favorite pizza to work with?"
      choices:
      - content: "/FavoritePizzas/{favorite}"
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "This format captures the favorite pizza name by using the curly braces to grab the second part of the requested URI."
      - content: "/FavoritePizzas/[favorite]"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Square brackets aren't part of the routing specification in Blazor."
      - content: "/FavoritePizzas?favorite"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "You can work with querystring parameters in Blazor, but this format doesn't capture those values."  
    - content: "Which syntax demonstrates a Blazor route parameter with a catch-all parameter?"
      choices:
      - content: "`/FavoritePizzas/{favorite?}`"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "The `?` marks a parameter as optional, not as a catch-all."
      - content: "`/FavoritePizzas/{favorite:catchall}`"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "The `:catchall` syntax looks like a route constraint but isn't a valid route constraint."
      - content: "`/FavoritePizzas/{*favorite}`"
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "The `*` will capture the rest of the path defined after `/FavoritePizzas/` and make it available in the `favorite` parameter."
