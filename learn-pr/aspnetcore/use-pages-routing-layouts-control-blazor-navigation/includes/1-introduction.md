Blazor creates interactive web applications using .NET that allow you to share app logic on both the server and client side, without the complexity of managing client-side JavaScript libraries.

Suppose you've been hired by a pizza delivery firm to modernize its customer-facing website. You've already built pages that display pizzas that enable customers to customize the toppings for their pizzas. You want to add ordering pages and improve the app's navigation. You also want to ensure a consistent layout across the app to ensure that customers can find what they're looking for easily.

In this module, you'll learn about how to route customers through the app by using the `@page` directive, Blazor routing, and the `NavLink` component. With navigation working, you'll focus on how to reduce duplicate code by adding layouts to the app.

## Learning objectives

At the end of this module, you'll be able to:

- Improve your Blazor app's navigation by using the router component and NavLinks.
- Enhance functionality with route parameters.
- Reduce duplicate code by using layouts in your Blazor app.
