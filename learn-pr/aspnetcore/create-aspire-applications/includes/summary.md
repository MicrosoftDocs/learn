Congratulations! In this module, you learned how to create a brand-new .NET Aspire solution and how to add .NET Aspire to an existing cloud-native application. 

You also saw how .NET Aspire takes care of many tasks that can be challenging for cloud-native apps, such as resolving a service discovery problem, with only a few lines of code. .NET Aspire also simplifies configuration tasks, and adding common services like databases, messaging, and caching.

Having completed this module, you can:

- Create new cloud-native apps by using the .NET Aspire templates in Visual Studio.
- Add the .NET Aspire stack to an existing .NET app for orchestration and simple cloud-native components.
