Creating a cloud-native application can be challenging, as it requires in-depth technical knowledge of both coding and infrastructure. Each microservice needs to locate and communicate with others, store data, utilize common services such as caches, and manage messaging queues. Using .NET Aspire simplifies many of these challenges, allowing you to focus more on developing your applicationâ€™s unique functionality.

Imagine you work for an outdoor equipment retailer. You're new to the development team, and want to see if it's difficult to add .NET Aspire to the team's current cloud-native app. You believe .NET Aspire can help your team reduce development effort.

In this module, learn how to use the .NET Aspire project templates in Visual Studio to create new cloud-native apps in just a few steps. To ease further development on an existing code base, see how to enlist an existing app in .NET Aspire orchestration.

## Learning objectives

By the end of this module, you're going to be able to:

- Create new cloud-native apps by using the .NET Aspire templates in Visual Studio.
- Add the .NET Aspire stack to an existing .NET app for orchestration and simple cloud-native integrations.
