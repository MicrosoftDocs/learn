  questions:
    - content: "What's the best place to store sensitive information, such as credentials, for GitHub Actions?"
      choices:
        - content: "*appsettings.json*"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "The *appsettings.json* file in an ASP.NET Core project stores information in plain text and is inaccessible to GitHub Actions."
        - content: "*web.config*"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "The *web.config* file is inaccessible to GitHub Actions and is better suited for other purposes, such as IIS configuration."
        - content: Azure Key Vault
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "You can get a Key Vault action from the GitHub Marketplace. However, GitHub provides built-in secrets functionality."
        - content: GitHub secrets
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "You can define secrets at the repository or the organization level. This information is encrypted and made accessible to GitHub Actions."
    - content: "What's the purpose of creating an Azure Active Directory service principal for GitHub Actions to use?"
      choices:
        - content: "The service principal is for storing application logs."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "The service principal isn't required for logging."
        - content: "The service principal is the name of the Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) resource."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "The AKS resource name isn't related to the service principal."
        - content: "The service principal is the GitHub Actions identity for doing tasks in Azure."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "GitHub Actions that interact with Azure must use a service principal."
        - content: "The service principal is the web URL of the app."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Service principals are unrelated to URLs."
    - content: "During upgrade deployment, why does AKS create a new container while the old one is still running?"
      choices:
        - content: "To avoid downtime."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "The old container isn't terminated until the new container is ready."
        - content: "To scale up."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Scaling operations aren't required during a regular deployment."
        - content: "For redundancy."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "The new and old containers aren't identical. Redundancy requires identical containers."
        - content: "To scale out."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Scaling operations aren't required during a regular deployment."
