ASP.NET developers need to know several concepts, syntaxes, and elements to make their webpages accessible for people of all abilities. By following the principles in this module, you can improve the accessibility of your web applications.

## Example scenario

Suppose your team is hired to build a web app for a pizza restaurant by using ASP.NET Core. A graphic designer already created the specifications, and a colleague implemented the basic functionality. The client asks you to review the site to ensure that it's broadly accessible.

## What will we be doing?

In this module, you first create a new ASP.NET Core web app and observe problems that affect its accessibility. You install tools to diagnose accessibility issues, and then fix issues with forms and visual accessibility. Finally, you use a screen reader to understand how accessibility issues can affect the screen reader experience. Then, you further improve your application to allow for screen reader-based navigation.

## What is the main goal?

By the end of this session, you're able to diagnose and fix accessibility issues in an ASP.NET Core web app. You also learn how to avoid common mistakes, so you can design and build web apps with accessibility in mind.
