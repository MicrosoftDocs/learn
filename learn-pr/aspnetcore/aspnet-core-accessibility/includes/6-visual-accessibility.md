Your users have various visual abilities. Someone who is color-blind might not be able to differentiate between colors or might have difficulty working with colors that are similar to one another. Other users might use zoom to enlarge content. Accommodating various visual abilities is an important part of accessibility.

## Contrast

Ensuring adequate contrast makes it easier for everyone to read text content, interpret graphical elements, identify UI components, and notice when those components change state. People with low vision often have difficulty reading text, identifying buttons that don't contrast with the background, or determining the state of UI components. The problems can be exacerbated if a person has a color deficiency that lowers the perceived contrast even further.

Fortunately, contrast ratios can be checked programmatically. You can use the FastPass tool in Accessibility Insights for Web to perform contrast checking.

## Color

Color is an important part of web design, but keep in mind that everyone sees color a little differently. For some, it results in color-blindness. About 1 in 12 men are color-blind. There are several different kinds of color-blindness, such as red-green and blue-yellow.

Additionally, your users might use a color to minimize eye fatigue, use a display that has poor color fidelity, or work in lighting that makes color perception difficult.

In the previous exercise, you learned that you should design your web applications so they don't require color vision.

In addition to FastPass automated tests, you can check how your site appears to people with varying degrees of color-blindness. Use the color filters that are built into [Windows](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/use-color-filters-in-windows-10-43893e44-b8b3-2e27-1a29-b0c15ef0e5ce) and [macOS](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/use-color-filters-mchl11ddd4b3/mac).

## Zoom

Your website looks beautiful on your enormous 4K monitor... but that doesn't mean all of your users experience it the same way. Some users might zoom in up to 200 percent to be able to read the text, and some might be reading on a mobile device.

Web browsers are good at scaling text. [Bootstrap was designed to facilitate responsive design](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/layout/grid/) that scales based on screen size. It's important for you to keep things as simple as possible, use the web as it was designed, and test your site on different displays and at varying levels of zoom.

In the next exercise, you find and fix visual accessibility issues on the pizza restaurant's website.
