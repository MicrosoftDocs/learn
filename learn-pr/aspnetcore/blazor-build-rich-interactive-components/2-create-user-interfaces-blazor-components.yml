    questions:
    - content: "If you are going to include a JavaScript file on a Blazor page, what is the recommended way to reference it?"
      choices:
      - content: "Add a script tag on the Blazor page"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Script tags shouldn't be added on Blazor pages because they won't render and load properly"
      - content: "Add a script tag to the `Pages/_Host.cshtml file"
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "The script tag should be added to the `_Host.cshtml` file so that it is available before the Blazor components need it"
      - content: "Add a script tag to the Layout.razor file"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "The layout should not include script tags and it would be better referenced in another location"
    - content: "Which method should you use to execute a JavaScript function from C# that returns void?"
      choices:
      - content: "InvokeVoidAsync"
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "This asynchronous method will execute a JavaScript function and await its response"
      - content: "Invoke"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Invoke is not the method on the JavaScript runtime object in .NET that should be called"
      - content: "InvokeAsync"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "The C# method needs to be told that it should not expect a return value from the JavaScript function.  This is not the correct choice"
