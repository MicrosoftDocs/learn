  questions:
    - content: "Which of these events isn't part of the Blazor component lifecycle?"
      choices:
        - content: "`OnInitializedAsync`"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "`OnInitialized` or `OnInitializedAsync` is the first event that triggers in the lifecycle."
        - content: "`OnPageLoad`"
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "`OnPageLoad` sounds similar to another event in ASP.NET, but it isn't present in the Blazor component lifecycle."
        - content: "`OnAfterRenderAsync`"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "`OnAfterRender` or `OnAfterRenderAsync` is the last event that triggers in the lifecycle, and may be triggered multiple times."
    - content: "Which of these events doesn't trigger the `SetParametersAsync` event?"
      choices:
        - content: "Route parameters are set."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Assigning route parameters to `Parameter` properties is one of the core features of the `SetParametersAsync` method."
        - content: "Private fields are allocated."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Private fields don't interact with values outside of the component and don't trigger the `SetParametersAsync` method."
        - content: "Component parameters are assigned from another component."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Assigning values from another component is a core feature of the `SetParametersAsync` method."
