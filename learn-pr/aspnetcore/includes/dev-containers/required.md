## Development container

This module includes configuration files that define a [development container](https://containers.dev), or *dev container*. Using a dev container ensures a standardized environment that's preconfigured with the required tools.

The dev container can run in either of two environments. Before you begin, follow the steps in one of the following links to set up your environment, including installing Docker and the necessary Visual Studio Code extensions.
