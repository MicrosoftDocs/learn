        - content: Configuration provider
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "A configuration provider is an abstraction over a specific configuration source, such as a JSON file. Configuration in an ASP.NET Core project is supported by one or more .NET Core configuration providers."
        - content: Azure App Configuration
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Azure App Configuration is a centralized configuration service useful in microservices apps. In an ASP.NET Core app, Azure App Configuration is registered as another configuration provider."
    - content: Which of the following statements is true about Azure App Configuration?
      choices:
        - content: App Configuration is an Azure service that centrally manages app settings and feature flags.
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "A centralized configuration service is especially useful in apps that are distributed in nature. Use App Configuration to store all the settings for your app and secure their accesses in one place."
        - content: App Configuration doesn't encrypt your app settings at rest.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "App Configuration encrypts all key values it holds, and it encrypts network communication. Key names and labels are used as indices for retrieving configuration data and aren't encrypted."
        - content: App Configuration can't be integrated with the .NET Feature Management library.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Though it's decoupled from the Feature Management library, App Configuration does easily integrate with the library."
