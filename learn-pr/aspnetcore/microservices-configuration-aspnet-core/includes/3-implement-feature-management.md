In this exercise, implement a feature flag to toggle a seasonal sales banner for your application. Feature flags allow you to toggle feature availability without redeploying your app.

You'll use the **Feature Management** in the .NET feature flag library. This library provides helpers to implement feature flags in your app. The library supports simple use cases like conditional statements to more advanced scenarios like conditionally adding routes or action filters. Additionally, it supports feature filters, which allow you to enable features based on specific parameters. Examples of such parameters include a window time, percentages, or a subset of users.

In this unit, you will:

* Create an Azure App Configuration instance.
* Add a feature flag to the App Configuration store.
* Connect your app to the App Configuration store.
* Amend the application to use the feature flag.
* Change the products page to display a sales banner.
* Build and test the app.

## Open the development environment

You can choose to use a GitHub codespace that hosts the exercise, or complete the exercise locally in Visual Studio Code.

To use a **codespace**, create a preconfigured GitHub Codespace with [this Codespace creation link](https://codespaces.new/MicrosoftDocs/mslearn-dotnet-cloudnative?devcontainer_path=.devcontainer%2Fdotnet-feature-flags%2Fdevcontainer.json).

GitHub takes several minutes to create and configure the codespace. When it's finished, you see the code files for the exercise. The code that's used for the remainder of this module is in the **/dotnet-feature-flags** directory.

To use **Visual Studio Code**, fork the [https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/mslearn-dotnet-cloudnative](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/mslearn-dotnet-cloudnative) repository to your own GitHub account. Then:

1. Make sure Docker is running. In a new Visual Studio Code window, press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd> to open the command palette.
1. Search for and select **Dev Containers: Clone Repository in Container Volume**.
1. Select your forked repository. Visual Studio Code creates your development container locally.

## Create an App Configuration instance

Complete the following steps to create an App Configuration instance in your Azure subscription:

1. In the new terminal pane, sign in to the Azure CLI.

    ```azurecli
    az login --use-device-code
    ```

1. View your selected Azure subscription.

    ```azurecli
    az account show -o table
    ```

    If the wrong subscription is selected, select the correct one using the [az account set](/cli/azure/account#az-account-set) command.

1. Run the following Azure CLI command to get a list of Azure regions and the Name associated with it:

   ```azurecli
   az account list-locations -o table
   ```

   Locate a region closest to you and use it in the next step to replace `[Closest Azure region]`

1. Run the following Azure CLI commands to create an App Configuration instance:

    ```azurecli
    export LOCATION=[Closest Azure region]
    export RESOURCE_GROUP=rg-eshop
    export CONFIG_NAME=eshop-app-features$SRANDOM    
    ```

    You need to change the **LOCATION** to an Azure region close to you, for example **eastus**. If you'd like a different name for your resource group or app configuration change the values above.

1. Run the following command to create the Azure Resource Group:

   ```azurecli
   az group create --name $RESOURCE_GROUP --location $LOCATION
   ```

1. Run the following command to create an App Configuration instance:

    ```azurecli
    az appconfig create --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --name $CONFIG_NAME --location $LOCATION --sku Free
    ```

    A variation of the following output appears:

    ```json
    {
      "createMode": null,
      "creationDate": "2023-10-31T15:40:10+00:00",
      "disableLocalAuth": false,
      "enablePurgeProtection": false,
      "encryption": {
        "keyVaultProperties": null
      },
      "endpoint": "https://eshop-app-features1168054702.azconfig.io",
      "id": "/subscriptions/7eebce2a-0884-4df2-8d1d-2a3c051e47fe/resourceGroups/rg-eshop/providers/Microsoft.AppConfiguration/configurationStores/eshop-app-features1168054702",
      "identity": null,
    ```

1. Run this command to retrieve the connection string for the App Configuration instance:

    ```azurecli
    az appconfig credential list --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --name $CONFIG_NAME --query [0].connectionString --output tsv
    ```

    This string prefixed with `Endpoint=` represents the App Configuration store's connection string.

1. Copy the connection string. You'll use it in a moment.

### Store the App Configuration connection string

You'll now add the App Configuration connection string to the application. Complete the following steps:

1. Open the **:::no-loc text="/dotnet-feature-flags/docker-compose.yml":::** file.

1. Add a new environment variable at line 13.

    ```yml
    - ConnectionStrings:AppConfig=[PASTE CONNECTION STRING HERE]
    ```

    The **:::no-loc text="docker-compose.yml":::** will resemble the following YAML:

    ```yml
    environment: 
      - ProductEndpoint=http://backend:8080
      - ConnectionStrings:AppConfig=Endpoint=https://eshop-app-features1168054702.azconfig.io;Id=<ID>;Secret=<Secret value>
    ```

The preceding line represents a key-value pair, in which `ConnectionStrings:AppConfig` is an environment variable name. In the *:::no-loc text="Store":::* project, the environment variables configuration provider reads its value.

> [!TIP]
> Your Azure App Configuration connection string contains a plain-text secret. In real world apps, consider integrating App Configuration with Azure Key Vault for secure storage of secrets. Key Vault is out of scope for this module, but guidance can be found at [Tutorial: Use Key Vault references in an ASP.NET Core app](/azure/azure-app-configuration/use-key-vault-references-dotnet-core).

### Add the feature flag to the App Configuration store

In Azure App Configuration, create and enable a key-value pair to be treated as a feature flag. Complete the following steps:

1. In another browser tab, sign into the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com?azure-portal=true) with the same account and directory as the Azure CLI.
1. Use the search box to find and open the App Configuration resource prefixed with **:::no-loc text="eshop-app-features":::**.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/app-configuration-resource.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Azure portal search results showing the App Configuration resource prefixed with 'eshop-app-features'." border="true" lightbox="../media/app-configuration-resource.png":::

1. In the **Operations** section, select **Feature manager**.
1. In the top menu, select **+ Create**.
1. Select the **Enable feature flag** check box.
1. In the **Feature flag name** text box, enter **SeasonalDiscount**. 
1. Select **Apply**.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/feature-flag-enabled.png" alt-text="A screenshot of the new added feature flag.":::

    Now that the feature flag exists in the App Configuration store, the **:::no-loc text="Store":::** project requires some changes to read it.

## Review code

Review the directories in the explorer pane in the IDE. Note that there's three projects **:::no-loc text="DataEntities":::**, **:::no-loc text="Products":::**, and **:::no-loc text="Store":::**. The **:::no-loc text="Store":::** project is the Blazor app. The **:::no-loc text="Products":::** project is a .NET Standard library that contains the product service. The **:::no-loc text="DataEntities":::** project is a .NET Standard library that contains the product model.

### Connect your app to the App Configuration store

To access values from the App Configuration store in an ASP.NET Core app, the configuration provider for App Configuration is needed.

Apply the following changes to your **:::no-loc text="Store":::** project:

1. In the terminal window, navigate to the Store folder:

    ```bash
    cd dotnet-feature-flags/Store
    ```

1. Run the following command to install a NuGet package containing the .NET configuration provider for the App Configuration service:

    ```dotnetcli
    dotnet add package Microsoft.Azure.AppConfiguration.AspNetCore
    dotnet add package Microsoft.FeatureManagement.AspNetCore
    dotnet add package Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.AzureAppConfiguration
    ```

1. Open the **:::no-loc text="Store/Program.cs":::** file.
1. Add the new package references at the top of the file:

    ```csharp
    using Microsoft.FeatureManagement;
    using Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration;
    using Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.AzureAppConfiguration;
    ```

1. Add this code below the **// Add the AddAzureAppConfiguration code** comment.

    ```csharp
    // Retrieve the connection string
    var connectionString = builder.Configuration.GetConnectionString("AppConfig");
    
    // Load configuration from Azure App Configuration
    builder.Configuration.AddAzureAppConfiguration(options => {
      options.Connect(connectionString)
        .UseFeatureFlags();
    });
    
    // Register the Feature Management library's services
    builder.Services.AddFeatureManagement();
    builder.Services.AddAzureAppConfiguration();
    ```

    In the preceding code snippet:

    * The `Connect` method authenticates to the App Configuration store. Recall that the connection string is being passed as an environmental variable `ConnectionStrings:AppConfig`.
    * The `UseFeatureFlags` method enables the Feature Management library to read feature flags from the App Configuration store.
    * The two `builder.Services` calls register the Feature Management library's services with the app's dependency injection container.

1. At the bottom of the file, below **// Add the App Configuration middleware**, add this code:

    ```csharp
    app.UseAzureAppConfiguration();
    ```

    The preceding code adds the App Configuration middleware to the request pipeline. The middleware triggers a refresh operation for the Feature Management parameters for every incoming request. Then it's up to the `AzureAppConfiguration` provider to decide, based on refresh settings, when to actually connect to the store to get the values.

### Enable a sales banner

Your app can now read the feature flag, but the products page needs to be updated to show that a sale is on. Complete the following steps:

1. Open the **:::no-loc text="Store/Components/Pages/Products.razor":::** file.
1. At the top of the file, add the following code:

    ```csharp
    @using Microsoft.FeatureManagement
    @inject IFeatureManager FeatureManager
    ```

    The preceding code imports the Feature Management library's namespaces and injects the `IFeatureManager` interface into the component.

1. In the **:::no-loc text="@code":::** section, add the following variable to store the state of the feature flag:

    ```csharp
    private bool saleOn = false;  
    ```

1. In the **:::no-loc text="OnInitializedAsync":::** method, add the following code:

    ```csharp
    saleOn = await FeatureManager.IsEnabledAsync("SeasonalDiscount");
    ```

    The method should look like the following code:

    ```csharp
    protected override async Task OnInitializedAsync()
    {
        saleOn = await FeatureManager.IsEnabledAsync("SeasonalDiscount");

        // Simulate asynchronous loading to demonstrate streaming rendering
        products = await ProductService.GetProducts();
    }
    ```

1. At line 26, under the **:::no-loc text="<!-- Add a sales alert for customers -->":::** comment, add the following code:

    ```razor
    <!-- Add a sales alert for customers -->
    @if (saleOn)
    {
    <div class="alert alert-success" role="alert">
      Our sale is now on.
    </div>
    }
    ```

    The preceding code displays a sales alert if the feature flag is enabled.

### Build the app

1. Ensure you've saved all your changes, and are in the **dotnet-feature-flags** directory. In the terminal, run the following command:

    ```dotnetcli
    dotnet publish /p:PublishProfile=DefaultContainer 
    ```

1. Run the app using docker:

    ```bash
    docker compose up
    ```  

### Test the feature flag

To verify the feature flag works as expected in a codespace, complete the following steps:

1. Switch to the **PORTS** tab, then to the right of the local address for the **Front End** port, select the globe icon. The browser opens a new tab at the homepage.
1. Select **Products**.

If you're using Visual Studio Code locally, open **http://localhost:32000/products**.

:::image type="content" source="../media/sale-alert.png" alt-text="A screenshot showing the sale alert on the products page." border="true" lightbox="../media/sale-alert.png":::

In the Azure portal, you can enable and disable the feature flag and refresh the products page to see the flag in action.
