In this exercise, you use the OpenTelemetry APIs to add custom data to the logs. You also examine the logs to find your custom events.

## Install prerequisites

The prerequisites for this exercise are:

- .NET 8
- Visual Studio 2022 Preview
- Docker Desktop
- .NET Aspire workload in Visual Studio

If these packages are already installed, you can skip ahead to begin working with OpenTelemetry logging.

### Install .NET 8

Follow this [.NET 8](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0) link, and select the correct installer for your operating system. For example, if you're using Windows 11, and a modern processor, select the x64 .NET 8 SDK for Windows.

After the download is complete, run the installer and follow the instructions. In a terminal window, run the following command to verify that the installation was successful:

```powershell
dotnet --version
```

You should see the version number of the .NET SDK you installed. For example:

```console
8.0.300-preview.24203.14
```

### Install Visual Studio 2022 Preview

Follow this [Visual Studio 2022 Preview](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/preview/) link, and select **Download Preview**. After the download is complete, run the installer and follow the instructions.

### Install Docker Desktop

Follow this [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) link, and select the correct installer for your operating system. After the download is complete, run the installer and follow the instructions. For the best performance and compatibility, use the **WSL 2** backend.

Open the Docker Desktop application and accept the service agreement.

### Install the .NET Aspire workload in Visual Studio

Install the .NET Aspire workload using the .NET CLI:

1. Open a terminal.
1. Update .NET workloads with this command:

    ```dotnetcli
    dotnet workload update
    ```

    You should see a message that the workloads are updated successfully.

    ```console
    No workloads installed for this feature band. To update workloads installed with earlier SDK versions, include the --from-previous-sdk option.
    Updated advertising manifest microsoft.net.sdk.ios.
    Updated advertising manifest microsoft.net.workload.mono.toolchain.net6.

    No workloads installed for this feature band. To update workloads installed with earlier SDK versions, include the --from-previous-sdk option.
    
    Successfully updated workload(s): .
    ```

1. Install the .NET Aspire workload with this command:

    ```dotnetcli
    dotnet workload install aspire
    ```

    You should see a message that the Aspire workload is successfully installed.

    ```console
    Installing Aspire.Hosting.Sdk.Msi.x64 ...... Done
    Installing Aspire.ProjectTemplates.Msi.x64 ..... Done
    Installing Aspire.Hosting.Orchestration.win-x64.Msi.x64 ............. Done
    Installing Aspire.Hosting.Msi.x64 ..... Done
    Installing Aspire.Dashboard.Sdk.win-x64.Msi.x64 ....... Done
    
    Successfully installed workload(s) aspire.
    ```

1. Verify that the .NET Aspire workload is installed with this command:

    ```dotnetcli
    dotnet workload list
    ```

    You should see the details of the .NET Aspire workload.

    ```console
    Installed Workload Id      Manifest Version      Installation Source
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    aspire                     8.0.0/8.0.100         SDK 8.0.300-preview.24203, VS 17.10.34902.84

    Use `dotnet workload search` to find additional workloads to install.
    ```

## Clone the sample app

Let's use `git` to obtain a sample app. Because the app includes .NET Aspire, **OpenTelemetry** is included with default logging, metrics, and distributed tracing:

1. In the command line, browse to a folder of your choice where you can work with code.
1. Execute the following command to clone the **Northern Mountains eShop** sample application:

    ```dotnetcli
    git clone -b aspire-telemetry https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/mslearn-aspire-starter
    ```

## Log a message using compile time source generation

We can use compile time source generation to create performant logging code automatically. Let's implement that technique for getting products brands:

1. Open Visual Studio and select **Open a project or solution**.
1. Browse to the folder where you cloned the starter project. Open the **start** folder, select **eShop.aspiretelemetry.sln**, and then select **Open**.
1. In **Solution Explorer**, expand **WebApp > Services** and double-click _CatalogService.cs_.
1. Locate the following line of code, which declares the `CatalogService` class:

    ```csharp
    public class CatalogService(HttpClient httpClient)
    ```

1. To use compile time source generation, we have to make this class `partial` and use dependency injection to obtain the logger. Modify the line to match this code:

    ```csharp
    public partial class CatalogService(HttpClient httpClient, ILogger<CatalogService> logger)
    ```

1. Next, anywhere in the `CatalogService` class outside other methods, create a new `static partial` method named **LogGetBrands**:

    ```csharp
    public static partial void LogGetBrands(string uri, ILogger logger);
    ```

1. Immediately before that line, add the `LoggerMessageAttribute` and define the logging level and message:

    ```csharp
    [LoggerMessage(
    EventId = 0,
    Level = LogLevel.Information,
    Message = "Getting brands from URI: {uri}")]
    ```

1. Locate the `GetBrands()` method and the following line of code in it:

    ```csharp
    var uri = $"{remoteServiceBaseUrl}catalogBrands";
    ```

1. To call your new logging method, insert the following code after that line:

    ```csharp
    LogGetBrands(uri, logger);
    ```

1. To save your changes, press <kbd>CTRL + S</kbd> or select **File > Save All**.

## Test the instrumentation

Now, we test the compile time source generation logging:

1. In Visual Studio, to start the app in debugging mode, press <kbd>F5</kbd> or select **Debug > Start Debugging**.
1. If the **Start Docker Desktop** message appears, select **Yes**. The app starts and displays the .NET Aspire dashboard in a browser tab.
1. To make some requests, locate the **webapp** project in the **Resources** list and then select one of its entries in the **Endpoints** column:

    :::image type="content" source="../media/aspire-dashboard-open-webapp.png" lightbox="../media/aspire-dashboard-open-webapp.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the .NET Aspire dashboard and the location of the webapp's endpoint links.":::

1. A new browser tab appears and displays the Northern Mountains homepage. The brands list is included on the left-hand side. Switch back to the .NET Aspire dashboard and select **Structured** on the left-hand menu.
1. In the **Filter** textbox, type **Getting brands**. The page displays your logged event:

    :::image type="content" source="../media/structured-logs-compile-time-event.png" lightbox="../media/structured-logs-compile-time-event.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing filtered events in the .NET Aspire dashboard.":::

1. In the **Details** column for your event, select **View**. The dashboard opens a lower pane to display the details of the entry.
1. Close the browser tabs and in Visual Studio, press <kbd>SHIFT + F5</kbd> or select **Debug > Stop Debugging**.
1. Close Visual Studio.
