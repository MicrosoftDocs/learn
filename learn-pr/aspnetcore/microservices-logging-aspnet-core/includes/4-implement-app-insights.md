In this unit, you'll modify the catalog service to enable Application Insights telemetry. Application Insights has already been enabled for the other three microservices; however, configuration changes are required.

You will:

- Review the directory structure for the code sample.
- Create Application Insights resources for the app.
- Enable logging to Application Insights.
- Deploy the updated and reconfigured microservices.

## Review the directory structure

Review the directories in the explorer pane in the IDE. Relative to the workspace root, the files for this module are located in *modules/microservices-logging-aspnet-core*.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For brevity, all directory paths described in this module are relative to the *modules/microservices-logging-aspnet-core* directory.

## Create and configure the Application Insights resources

1. In the terminal you used earlier, ensure the Application Insights extension is added to Azure CLI by running this command:

    ```azurecli
    az extension add --name application-insights
    ```

1. Run the following commands to create the Application Insights resources:

    ```azurecli
    az configure --defaults group=eshop-learn-rg location=centralus && \
        az monitor app-insights component create --app catalog \
            --query '{Name:name, Key:instrumentationKey}' && \
        az monitor app-insights component create --app coupon \
            --query '{Name:name, Key:instrumentationKey}' && \
        az monitor app-insights component create --app ordering \
            --query '{Name:name, Key:instrumentationKey}' && \
        az monitor app-insights component create --app webshoppingagg \
            --query '{Name:name, Key:instrumentationKey}' && \
        az configure --defaults group= location=
    ```

    The preceding commands create four Application Insights resources, in the resource group you created for this module. A variation of the following output appears:

    ```console
    {
      "Key": "037fb7a1-2eb5-45e8-9193-806becc426f9",
      "Name": "catalog"
    }
    {
      "Key": "726d19a4-2493-4c03-bdc5-817f2a7a3ffa",
      "Name": "coupon"
    }
    {
      "Key": "0ac4010c-9ac4-47ae-80b3-16c4d1a7889b",
      "Name": "ordering"
    }
    {
      "Key": "c0cde760-d563-4534-9b4f-0eac68763d40",
      "Name": "webshoppingagg"
    }
    ```

    In the preceding output, there are four key-value pairs, where:

    - The `Key` property represents the Application Insights instrumentation key.
    - The `Name` property represents the name of the service to which the instrumentation key belongs.

1. Uncomment the `APPINSIGHTS_INSTRUMENTATIONKEY` environment variable in each of the following files in the *:::no-loc text="deploy/k8s/helm-simple":::* directory. Replace the `<key>` placeholder with the appropriate Application Insights instrumentation key.
    - *:::no-loc text="catalog/templates/configmap.yaml":::*
    - *:::no-loc text="coupon/templates/configmap.yaml":::*
    - *:::no-loc text="ordering/templates/configmap.yaml":::*
    - *:::no-loc text="webshoppingagg/templates/configmap.yaml":::*

    For example, update the catalog service's Helm chart template as follows:

    :::code language="yaml" source="../code/deploy/k8s/helm-simple/catalog/templates/configmap.yaml" highlight="9":::

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > Each microservice requires a different instrumentation key.

    The environment variables defined within the `data` element are accessible by the service at runtime.

## Enable logging to Application Insights

Logging to Application Insights has been enabled in the ordering and coupon services and the HTTP aggregator. Complete the following steps to implement Application Insights in the catalog service.

1. In the terminal, temporarily set your working directory to *src/Services/Catalog/Catalog.API*:

    ```bash
    pushd ../../src/Services/Catalog/Catalog.API/
    ```

1. Install the supporting Application Insights NuGet packages:

    ```dotnetcli
    dotnet add package Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.AspNetCore --version 2.20.0 && \
    dotnet add package Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.Kubernetes --version 2.0.2 && \
    dotnet add package Serilog.Sinks.ApplicationInsights --version 3.1.0
    ```

    The following table outlines the packages that were installed.

    | Package                                    | Description                                                                                    |
    |--------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
    | `Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.AspNetCore` | Adds Application Insights support for ASP.NET Core apps.                                       |
    | `Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.Kubernetes` | Enables gathering of telemetry for .NET Core apps running in containers managed by Kubernetes. |
    | `Serilog.Sinks.ApplicationInsights`        | A Serilog sink that writes events to Application Insights.                                     |

1. Apply the following changes in the *:::no-loc text="src/Services/Catalog/Catalog.API":::* directory:
    1. In *:::no-loc text="Extensions/ServiceCollectionExtensions.cs":::*, replace the comment `// Add AddAppInsights extension method` with the following extension method.

        :::code language="csharp" source="../code/src/services/catalog/catalog.api/extensions/servicecollectionextensions.cs":::

        In the preceding code:

        - The `AddApplicationInsightsTelemetry` extension method is provided by the `Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.AspNetCore` NuGet package.
        - The `AddApplicationInsightsKubernetesEnricher` extension method is provided by the `Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.Kubernetes` NuGet package.

    1. In the *:::no-loc text="Startup.cs":::* file's `ConfigureServices` method, invoke the `AddAppInsights` extension method.

        :::code language="csharp" source="../code/src/services/catalog/catalog.api/startup.cs" highlight="3":::

        The preceding code registers the telemetry services in the dependency injection container.

    1. In *:::no-loc text="Program.cs":::*, add the highlighted code to the `CreateSerilogLogger` method:

        :::code language="csharp" source="../code/src/services/catalog/catalog.api/program.cs" highlight="5,12":::

        The preceding changes add the Application Insights sink for Serilog to include log traces. Note the following details:

        - The `Serilog.Sinks.ApplicationInsights` NuGet package provides the `ApplicationInsights` extension method.
        - The `APPINSIGHTS_INSTRUMENTATIONKEY` environment variable defined in the catalog service's Helm chart template is accessed with the .NET Core Configuration API.

        > [!NOTE]
        > Startup logging with Application Insights [isn't supported](/aspnet/core/fundamentals/logging/#log-during-host-construction), so it must be accomplished using another logger. This example uses Serilog with the Application Insights sink, passing the instrumentation key. Although this is the simplest way to enable logging to Application Insights during startup, it can lead to losing correlation between metrics and log traces.

1. Save all your changes, and then build the catalog service and its dependencies:

    ```dotnetcli
    dotnet build
    ```

    The build succeeds with no warnings. If the build fails, check the output for troubleshooting information.

## Build and deploy modified container images

In the previous section, you modified the catalog service to enable Application Insights telemetry. The HTTP aggregator code has already been similarly instrumented. To update the production service deployments, the container images will be built and hosted on ACR.

1. Return to the *deploy/k8s* directory:

    ```bash
    popd
    ```

1. Run this script to build the images for the catalog service and HTTP aggregator:

    ```bash
    ./build-to-acr.sh --services catalog-api,webshoppingagg
    ```

    The script starts [ACR quick tasks](/azure/container-registry/container-registry-tasks-overview#quick-task) for each service. Each service's container image is built independently. Variations of the following lines confirm that the catalog and HTTP aggregator Docker images were pushed to ACR:

    ```console
    2020/09/30 20:51:57 Successfully pushed image: eshoplearn20200929194132362.azurecr.io/catalog.api:linux-latest
    ```

    ```console
    2020/09/30 20:54:15 Successfully pushed image: eshoplearn20200929194132362.azurecr.io/webshoppingagg:linux-latest
    ```

1. Deploy the updated catalog service and HTTP aggregator from ACR by running the following script:

    ```bash
    ./deploy-application.sh --charts catalog,webshoppingagg
    ```

    The preceding script deploys the container images from ACR to AKS. The script runs the `kubectl get pods` command. The command's output contains entries for the catalog service and HTTP aggregator pods. The `STATUS` and `AGE` column values indicate that the deployments were successful:

    ```console
    NAME                              READY   STATUS              RESTARTS   AGE
    catalog-5f45f57cd9-4cml4          0/1     Running             0          20s
    webshoppingagg-77d8cc5c4c-f95tk   0/1     ContainerCreating   0          1s
    ```

1. Redeploy the coupon and ordering services configured with their new `APPINSIGHTS_INSTRUMENTATIONKEY` environment variables:

    ```bash
    ./deploy-application.sh --registry eshoplearn --charts coupon,ordering
    ```

    The coupon and ordering services deployed by the setup script are already instrumented for telemetry. Since there were no code changes, the containers only need redeployment with the new configuration settings. The `--registry` parameter instructs the script to use the Docker Hub registry that hosts the unmodified images. As in the previous step, the `kubectl get pods` command is executed:

    ```console
    NAME                              READY   STATUS              RESTARTS   AGE
    coupon-5b9597995-thw76            0/1     Running             0          20s
    ordering-6c456f5d4c-5sr2m         0/1     ContainerCreating   0          1s
    ```

## Verify the deployment to AKS

Even though the app has been deployed, it might take a few minutes to come online. Verify that the app is deployed and online with the following steps:

1. Run the following command to display the various app URLs:

    ```bash
    cat ../../deployment-urls.txt
    ```

    A variation of the following output appears:

    ```console
    The eShop-Learn application has been deployed to "http://203.0.113.55" (IP: 203.0.113.55).

    You can begin exploring these services (when ready):
    - Centralized logging       : http://203.0.113.55/seq/#/events?autorefresh (See transient failures during startup)
    - General application status: http://203.0.113.55/webstatus/ (See overall service status)
    - Web SPA application       : http://203.0.113.55/
    ```

1. Select the **General application status** link in the terminal to view the *:::no-loc text="WebStatus":::* health checks dashboard. The resulting page displays the status of each microservice in the deployment. The page is designed to refresh automatically, every 10 seconds.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > If the WebStatus isn't automatically refreshing, it's due to an issue with the container image used for WebStatus. To work around the issue, manually refresh the WebStatus page periodically.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/4-implement-app-insights/health-check.png" alt-text="health checks status dashboard." lightbox="../media/4-implement-app-insights/health-check.png":::

    > [!NOTE]
    > The services take several minutes to return to a healthy state.

1. After all the services are healthy, select the **:::no-loc text="Web SPA application":::** link in the terminal to test the *:::no-loc text="eShopOnContainers":::* web app. The following page appears:

    :::image type="content" source="../../media/microservices/eshop-spa.png" alt-text="eShop single page app." border="true" lightbox="../../media/microservices/eshop-spa.png":::

You've successfully verified that the app was deployed to AKS and is working properly.

In the next unit, you'll examine the telemetry in Application Insights.
