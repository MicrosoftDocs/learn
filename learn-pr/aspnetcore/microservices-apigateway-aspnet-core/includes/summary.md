Congratulations! You've learned about API gateways in .NET microservices apps.

In this module, you:

- Deployed an existing ASP.NET Core microservices e-commerce app to Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).
- Implemented a Backend for Frontend (BFF) pattern by using .NET.
- Redeployed the app to an instance of AKS configured to use [Azure Application Gateway](/azure/application-gateway/overview).
- Exposed a BFF API outside the Kubernetes cluster by using [Application Gateway Ingress Controller](/azure/application-gateway/ingress-controller-overview).
