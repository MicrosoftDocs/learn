  questions:
    - content: The BFF pattern is an extension of the API Gateway pattern
      choices:
        - content: "True"
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: This is correct. In few scenarios, API Gateway pattern is not sufficient to solve client specific problem. BFF can he helpful in such scenarios.
        - content: "False"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: This is not correct. Sometimes, BFF is needed along with API Gateway pattern to solve client specific problem.    
    - content: Mark the correct answer about the Kubernetes ingress object.
      choices:
        - content: Kubernetes ingress object helps to set up the communication among pods.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: This is not correct. Ingress object is usually used to expose HTTP endpoints outside of the Kubernetes cluster.
        - content: Kubernetes ingress object gets created automatically when you set up a Kubernetes cluster.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: This is not correct. You'll need to separate create and configure the ingress object route for each of your service, which you want to expose outside.
        - content: Kubernetes ingress object is usually used to expose HTTP endpoints outside of the Kubernetes cluster.
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: This is correct.
        - content: Ingress object can route the traffic of it's own. You don't need any ingress controller.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: This is not correct. You'll need to have an ingress controller for ingress object to work. It can be NGINX ingress controller or Azure Application Gateway ingress controller.
    - content: Mark the correct answer about the Azure Application Gateway.
      choices:
        - content: The Application Gateway "lives" inside the AKS cluster to route traffic to the pods.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: This is not correct. Application Gateway runs outside of the Kubernetes cluster.
        - content: The Application Gateway uses a special network configuration to access the pods directly.
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: This is correct. 
        - content: The NGINX ingress controller can use the Application Gateway if the ingresses have the `kubernetes.io/ingress.class:azure/application-gateway` annotation
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: This is not correct. Only Application Gateway ingress controller can read ingress configuration based on the `application-gateway` annotation.
        - content: All ingresses need the `appgw.ingress.kubernetes.io/backend-path-prefix` annotation to use the Application Gateway
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: This statement is not entirely correct. `backend-path-prefix` annotation is not a mandatory configuration. It's need to implement URL rewriting.
