title: Understand API gateways in a cloud-native ASP.NET Core microservices app
summary: Modify a cloud-native ASP.NET Core microservices app to understand API gateways in Azure.
abstract: |
  In this module, you will:
  - Deploy an existing ASP.NET Core microservices e-commerce application to Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).
  - Implement a Backend for Frontend (BFF) pattern by using .NET.
  - Deploy the microservices application to an AKS instance that's using Azure Application Gateway.
  - Expose the BFF API outside the Kubernetes cluster by using Application Gateway Ingress Controller and access that external Swagger client.
