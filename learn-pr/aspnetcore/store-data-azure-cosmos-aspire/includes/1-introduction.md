Databases underpin any microservice that needs to persist information in the long term. Each microservice in a cloud-native solution can use a different database system to store data about products, customers, shopping baskets, social media posts, or many other object types. Azure Cosmos DB is an industry-leading NoSQL, relational, and vector database that runs in the Azure cloud. .NET Aspire includes built-in components that make it easy to read and write data from Cosmos DB.

Imagine that an outdoor equipment company employs you. You're writing a new customer-facing eShop as a cloud-native application and you use .NET Aspire to ease development. Several of your microservices need to store data in a database. You'd like to assess Cosmos DB and decide whether it's the best solution for one or more of your microservices.

In this module, you'll learn how to connect a .NET Aspire solution to Cosmos DB in your Azure subscription. You'll also see how to read and write data directly or by using Entity Framework.

## Learning objectives

At the end of this module, you'll be able to:

- Describe the advantages of using a cloud database solution in Azure for cloud-native apps.
- Store and retrieve data in an Azure Cosmos DB database using the .NET Aspire Azure Cosmos DB component.
- Use Entity Framework in .NET Aspire with data stored in Azure Cosmos DB.
