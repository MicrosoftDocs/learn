Cosmos DB is an industry-leading distributed database system hosted in Microsoft's Azure cloud. It's a Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) solution that scales automatically to meet demand and doesn't require you to manage infrastructure. It's an ideal database solution for microservices in a cloud-native solution, such as applications built with the .NET Aspire stack and it can manage NoSQL, relational, and vector databases. In this unit, you've seen how built-in .NET Aspire components make it easy to connect to Cosmos DB and interact with databases.

Now that you've completed this unit, you can:

- Describe the advantages of using a cloud database solution in Azure for cloud-native apps.
- Store and retrieve data in an Azure Cosmos DB database using the .NET Aspire Azure Cosmos DB component.
- Use Entity Framework in .NET Aspire with data stored in Azure Cosmos DB.
