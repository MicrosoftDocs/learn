When you design a cloud-native application, you always need to consider **Resiliency** â€“ the ability of an application or service to handle problems. Resiliency helps make your app fault-tolerant in a way that has the lowest possible impact on the user. 

You explored the following resilience approaches in this module:
  * Using a code-based approach.
  * Using an infrastructure-based approach.


## Cleanup Codespace

You can delete the codespace on [GitHub](https://github.com/codespaces) under **By repository** where you see **MicrosoftDocs/mslearn-dotnet-cloudnative**.
