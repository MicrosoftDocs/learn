The eShop project has two services that communicate with each other using HTTP requests. The `Store` service calls the `Product` service to get the list of all the current products available to buy.

The current version of the app has no resiliency handling. If the `Product` service is unavailable, the `Store` service returns an error to the customers and asks them to try again later. This behavior isn't a good user experience.

Your manager asks you to add resilience to the app, so that the `Store` service retries the backend service call if it fails.

In this exercise, you add resiliency to an existing cloud-native app and test your fix.

## Open the development environment

You can choose to use a GitHub codespace that hosts the exercise, or complete the exercise locally in Visual Studio Code.

To use a **codespace**, create a preconfigured GitHub Codespace with [this Codespace creation link](https://codespaces.new/MicrosoftDocs/mslearn-dotnet-cloudnative?devcontainer_path=.devcontainer%2Fdotnet-resiliency%2Fdevcontainer.json).

GitHub takes several minutes to create and configure the codespace. When the process completes, you see the code files for the exercise. The code to use for the remainder of this module is in the **/dotnet-resiliency** directory.

To use **Visual Studio Code**, fork the [https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/mslearn-dotnet-cloudnative](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/mslearn-dotnet-cloudnative) repository to your own GitHub account. Then:

1. Make sure Docker is running. In a new Visual Studio Code window, press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd> to open the command palette.
1. Search for and select **Dev Containers: Clone Repository in Container Volume**.
1. Select your forked repository. Visual Studio Code creates your development container locally.

### Build and run the app

1. In the bottom panel, select to the **TERMINAL** tab and run the following command go to the code root:

    ```cli
    cd dotnet-resiliency
    ```

1. Run the following command to build the eShop app images:

    ```bash
    dotnet publish /p:PublishProfile=DefaultContainer
    ```

1. Once the build completes, run the following command to start the app:

    ```bash
    docker compose up
    ```

1. In the bottom panel, select to the **PORTS** tab, then in the Forwarded Address column of the table, select the **Open in Browser** icon for the **Front End (32000**) port. 

    If you're running the app locally, open a browser window to view [http://localhost:32000/products](http://localhost:32000/products).

1. The eShop app should be running. Select the **Products** menu item, you should see the list of products.

## Test the current resiliency

Stop the product service to see what happens to the app.

1. Go back to your codespace, and in the **TERMINAL** tab select **+** to open a new bash terminal.

1. Run the following docker command to list the running containers:

    ```bash
    docker ps
    ```

    You should see the list of currently running containers, for example:

    ```bash
    CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                                                                            COMMAND                  CREATED          STATUS          PORTS                                                        NAMES

    ```

1. Look for the CONTAINER ID for the **productservice** container. In the above example, the ID is **6ba80f3c7ab0**.
1. Stop your product service with this docker command:

    ```bash
    docker stop <CONTAINER ID>
    ```

    Where the `<CONTAINER ID>` is the ID you found in the previous step. For example:

    ```bash
    docker stop 6ba80f3c7ab0
    ```

1. Go back to the browser tab running the app and refresh the page. You should see an error message:

    *There is a problem loading our products. Please try again later.*

1. Go back to your codespace, and in the **TERMINAL** select the **docker** terminal and press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> to stop the app. You should see:

    ```bash
    Gracefully stopping... (press Ctrl+C again to force)
    Aborting on container exit...
    [+] Stopping 2/1
     ✔ Container eshoplite-frontend-1  Stopped                                                                      0.3s 
     ✔ Container eshoplite-backend-1   Stopped                                                                      0.0s 
    canceled
    ```

## Add resiliency to the app

The first steps to make your app more resilient are to add the `Microsoft.Extensions.Http.Resilience` NuGet package to the project. You can then use it in **Program.cs**.

### Add the Microsoft.Extensions.Http.Resilience package

1. In your codespace, on the **TERMINAL** tab, navigate to the **Store** project folder:

    ```bash
    cd Store
    ```

1. Run the following command to add the resiliency NuGet package:

    ```bash
    dotnet add package Microsoft.Extensions.Http.Resilience
    ```

    Running this command from the terminal in the apps project folder adds the package reference to the **Store.csproj** project file.

1. In the **EXPLORER** sidebar, select **Program.cs**.

1. At the top of the file, add the following using statement:

    ```csharp
    using Microsoft.Extensions.Http.Resilience;
    ```

### Add a standard resilience strategy

1. At Line 13, before **;**, add this code:

    ```csharp
    .AddStandardResilienceHandler()
    ```

    Your code should look like this:

    ```csharp
    builder.Services.AddHttpClient<ProductService>(c =>
    {
        var url = builder.Configuration["ProductEndpoint"] ?? throw new InvalidOperationException("ProductEndpoint is not set");
    
        c.BaseAddress = new(url);
    }).AddStandardResilienceHandler();
    ```

    The above code adds a standard resilience handler to the HTTPClient. The handler uses all the default settings for the standard resilience strategy.

    No other code changes are needed to your app. Let's run the app and test the resiliency.

1. Run the following commands to rebuild the eShop app:

    ```bash
    cd ..
    dotnet publish /p:PublishProfile=DefaultContainer
    ```

1. When the build completes, run the following command to start the app:

    ```bash
    docker compose up
    ```

1. Go back to the browser tab running the app and refresh the product page. You should see the list of products.

1. Go back to your codespace, and in the **TERMINAL** tab select the second bash terminal. Copy the CONTAINER ID for the **productservice** container.

1. Rerun the docker stop command:

    ```bash
    docker stop <CONTAINER ID>
    ```

1. Go back to the browser tab running the app and refresh the product page. This time, it should take a little longer until you see the apps error message:

    *There's a problem loading our products. Please try again later.*

    Let's check the logs to see if our resilience strategy is working.

1. Go back to your codespace, and in the **TERMINAL** tab select the **docker** terminal.

1. In the terminal, press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> to stop the app running.

1. In the log messages, scroll up until you find references to **Polly**. 

    ```bash
    eshoplite-frontend-1  | warn: Polly[3]
    eshoplite-frontend-1  |       Execution attempt. Source: 'ProductService-standard//Standard-Retry', Operation Key: '', Result: 'Name or service not known (backend:8080)', Handled: 'True', Attempt: '2', Execution Time: '27.2703'
    ```

    You should see many messages like this; each one is a retry attempt. The above message shows the second attempt, and the time it took to execute.

### Configure a resilience strategy

When you add resiliency to your app you're balancing the need to respond quickly to your users, with the need to not overload any backend services. Only you can decide if the default options meet your businesses needs.

In this example, you'd like the store service to wait a little longer, to give the store service a chance to recover.

1. In the code window for Program.cs, change the code at line 13 to:

    ```csharp
    .AddStandardResilienceHandler(options =>
    {
        options.Retry.MaxRetryAttempts = 7;
    });
    ```

    The above code changes the retry strategy defaults to have a maximum number of retires to seven. Remember the strategy is an exponential backoff, so the total time is around 5 minutes.

1. Stop docker up with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd>. Then run the following command to rebuild the eShop app:

    ```bash
    dotnet publish /p:PublishProfile=DefaultContainer
    ```

1. When the build completes, run the following command to start the app:

    ```bash
    docker compose up
    ```

    Stop the backend service container in the bash terminal and refresh the eShop. Note it takes longer to see the error message. If you check the logs though, you can see that the retry strategy only retried five times. The last message from Polly is:

    ```bash
    Polly.Timeout.TimeoutRejectedException: The operation didn't complete within the allowed timeout of '00:00:30'.
    ```

    The above message tells you that the total request timeout stops the maximum number of retries from being reached. You can fix the problem by increasing the total request timeout.

1. In the terminal, press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> to stop the app.

1. In the code window for Program.cs, change the code at line 13 to:

    ```csharp
    .AddStandardResilienceHandler(options =>
    {
        options.Retry.RetryCount = 7;
        options.TotalRequestTimeout = new HttpTimeoutStrategyOptions
        {
            Timeout = TimeSpan.FromMinutes(5)
        };
    });
    ```

    The above code changes the total request timeout to 260 seconds, which is now longer than the retry strategy.

    With these changes you should have enough time to run the app, stop the product service, check the terminal logs for retry attempts, refresh the eShop to see the loading message, and finally restart the product service to successfully see the list of products.

1. Run the following command to rebuild the eShop app:

    ```bash
    dotnet publish /p:PublishProfile=DefaultContainer
    ```

1. When the build completes, run the following command to start the app:

    ```bash
    docker compose up
    ```

### Test the new resiliency options

To help test the app in your container, use the Docker extension. The extension provides a GUI to view and control the state of containers.

1. From the left menu, select the **Docker** icon.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/docker-extension.png" alt-text="A screenshot of the docker extension, showing how to stop the products service."  lightbox="../media/docker-extension.png":::

1. In the **DOCKER** panel, under **CONTAINERS**, right-click the **products** container and select **Stop**.
1. Go back to the browser tab running the app and refresh the product page. You should see the **Loading...** message.
1. Go back to your codespace, and in the **TERMINAL** tab, select the **docker** terminal. The resilience strategy is working.
1. In the **DOCKER** panel, under **CONTAINERS**, right-click the **products** container and select **Start**.
1. Go back to the browser tab running the app. Wait and the app should recover showing the list the products.

1. In the Terminal, stop docker with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd>.
