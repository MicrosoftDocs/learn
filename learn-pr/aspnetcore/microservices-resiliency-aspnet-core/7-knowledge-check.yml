  title: Check what you learned
  questions:
    - content: What's the primary goal when implementing a resiliency solution for an app?
      choices:
        - content: Make the app error-free.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Making an app error-free is unlikely."
        - content: Handling user errors transparently.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Users should be provided useful feedback for errors."
        - content: Handling transient infrastructure failures.
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Resilience is about mitigating inevitable transient failures in an app's infrastructure."
        - content: Handling major infrastructure failures.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Major infrastructure failures generally aren't transient and require manual intervention."
    - content: Which of the following statements is correct?
      choices:
        - content: A code-based approach is the best option to handle failures, but it requires a significant amount of work.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "This is one option, but the best option depends on the context. .NET resiliency strategies require only minor code changes."
        - content: Implementing a service mesh requires little effort, but it only handles TCP connection failures.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Linkerd can handle HTTP, REST, and SQL connections."
        - content: Both a code-based and infrastructure-based approach can have complementary roles, depending on the context.
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: ".NET and Linkerd take different approaches to resiliency and have complementary roles."
    - content: Which of the following statements is true of Linkerd?
      choices:
        - content: It can't adjust retries and timeouts adapting to the current cluster state.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Linkerd can apply adaptive retry and timeout policies."
        - content: It can't monitor the traffic between pods.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Linkerd has a systemic view of all the pods in a cluster."
        - content: It doesn't require any changes to the app's code.
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Linkerd is deployed to a cluster without requiring any changes to an app's code."
        - content: It can't monitor all incoming and outgoing connections.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Linkerd is unconcerned with incoming or outgoing connections."
    - content: Which of the following statements is true about using .NET resiliency?
      choices:
        - content: It can't handle retries with exponential back-off.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: ".NET resiliency can be configured for retries with exponential back-off."
        - content: It can't ensure resiliency for complex database transactions.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: ".NET resiliency can protect complex transactions, including database transactions."
        - content: It does require app code changes.
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: ".NET resiliency does require code changes."
        - content: It must not be configured via code for every `HttpClient`.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Each `HttpClient` that requires resiliency must be configured via code to use .NET resiliency."
