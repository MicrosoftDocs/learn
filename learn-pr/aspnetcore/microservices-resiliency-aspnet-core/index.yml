title: Implement resiliency in a cloud-native ASP.NET Core microservice
summary: Learn how to make your cloud-native ASP.NET Core microservices app fault-tolerant with minimal impact on the user.
abstract: |
  In this module, you will:
  - Understand foundational resiliency concepts.
  - Observe the behavior of a microservice with no resiliency strategy.
