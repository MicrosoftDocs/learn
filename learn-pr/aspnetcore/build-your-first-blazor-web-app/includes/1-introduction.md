Get ready to build your first Blazor web app! If you're looking to get started with web development using the power and flexibility of the .NET platform, then you're at the right place. Blazor is a modern frontend web framework based on HTML, CSS, and C# that helps you build web apps *fast*.

To get started building with Blazor, you first need to set up your development environment by installing the .NET SDK and a preferred code editor. You can then create your first Blazor web app project and start to learn the fundamentals of working with Blazor components.

In this module, you'll learn everything you need to know to set up your .NET development environment and get your first Blazor created and running in just a few minutes. You'll learn how to create and use components, how to turn a component into a page, and how to do basic event handling and data binding. You'll then use everything you learned to build a basic to-do list app.

By the end of this module you should have a working Blazor development environment, a basic understanding of Blazor components, and a running Blazor web app that you built yourself.

Let's get started!
