  questions:
    - content: "In a microservices architecture, how do individual services access their data?"
      choices:
      - content: "Data is stored in a master data store that all microservices interact with."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "A shared data store doesn't provide autonomy, and applying data schema updates can cause runtime conflicts for services that access the same resources."
      - content: "Each microservice implements its own data store that's best optimized for its workload, storage needs, and read/write patterns."
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "Data isolation gives every microservice the autonomy to independently apply data schema updates, without affecting other services in the production environment."
      - content: "Services don't store data directly. The services send data to an event bus and a data repository service then processes it."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "The event bus is used for interservice communication, not data persistence."
    - content: "In the ASP.NET Core health checks middleware, what is the purpose of the code `services.AddHealthChecks().AddCheck(\"coupon-self\", () => HealthCheckResult.Healthy());` in `Startup.ConfigureServices`?"
      choices:
      - content: "It configures a Kubernetes liveness probe by using HTTP `GET`."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "The Kubernetes liveness probe that uses HTTP `GET` is configured in the Kubernetes configuration YAML file."
      - content: "It registers a health check named `coupon-self` that returns the HTTP success code to the endpoint configured in the `Startup.Configure` method."
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "A basic health probe that reports the app's availability to process requests is sufficient for many apps. This example always returns a healthy state."
      - content: "It maps a health check endpoint that is accessible at `<your-service>/liveness`."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "To map health check endpoints in ASP.NET Core, call `endpoints.MapHealthChecks(\"/liveness\");` in the `Startup.Configure` method."
    - content: "What's the benefit of using Azure Container Registry?"
      choices:
      - content: "Container Registry allows public access to container images, so developers can access the images without authenticating."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Container Registry is a private registry. Images can't be accessed without authentication."
      - content: "Container Registry is a private container registry that provides granular access control for development teams."
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "Container Registry provides Azure service principals as an authentication method to provide granular access to container images. For example, you can specify read-only access or full access to the container registry."
      - content: "Container Registry can support both public and private container registries."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Container Registry supports private registries only."
