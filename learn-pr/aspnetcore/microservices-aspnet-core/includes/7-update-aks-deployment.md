In this unit, you build and host the new and updated container images in Azure Container Registry. You then deploy the coupon service and configuration changes to the existing :::no-loc text="eShopOnContainers"::: app in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), and verify that the changes are successful.

## Container images in Azure Container Registry

Microservices solutions host their container images in container registries. A public container registry like Docker Hub is often sufficient. Private container registries like Azure Container Registry are more appropriate for enterprise scenarios. Only your team and services have access to your private container registry. Each container image used to deploy the :::no-loc text="eShopOnContainers"::: app to AKS is from a Container Registry endpoint.

The following diagram shows the relationships among Docker container images, container registries such as Container Registry, and AKS or other Kubernetes deployments.

:::image type="content" source="../media/6-add-coupon-service/acr-aks.png" alt-text="Diagram that shows a developer sending images to Container Registry and YAML files to AKS, and AKS using the YAML files to get the images from Container Registry." border="false" lightbox="../media/6-add-coupon-service/acr-aks.png":::

1. The developer sends container images to Container Registry.
1. The developer sends YAML configuration files to AKS. The configuration files specify which container images to use.
1. AKS retrieves the images from Container Registry, and uses the images to build and run the containers.

Because you don't have access to the :::no-loc text="eShopOnContainers"::: app owner's container registry, you host the coupon service container image and the modified *:::no-loc text="WebSPA":::* app container image in your private container registry. The `helm install` command specifies which container registry to use when you install the Helm charts to AKS.

## Build the coupon service

Run the following script in the terminal to build the coupon service and *:::no-loc text="WebSPA":::* app container images and host them in Container Registry. This process takes a few minutes.

```bash
./build-to-acr.sh
```

The preceding script builds the container images in Container Registry by using the `az acr build` command, with the provided *:::no-loc text="Dockerfile":::* files for the *:::no-loc text="Coupon.API":::* and *:::no-loc text="WebSPA":::* projects.

The solution doesn't build in your development container but in the cloud by using the container image in Container Registry. The terminal shows the `az acr build` command with the correct parameters, similar to the following example:

```azurecli
az acr build --registry eshoplearn \
     --image eshoplearn.azurecr.io/coupon.api:linux-net6-coupon \
     --file src/Services/Coupon/Coupon.API/Dockerfile \
     .
```

- The `--registry` parameter specifies the name of the container registry to use.
- The `--image` parameter specifies the name and tag of the image, in the format `<repo url>/<name>:<tag>`.
- The `--file` parameter specifies the relative path of the *:::no-loc text="Dockerfile":::*.
- The final parameter, which is positional and not indicated by a command-line flag, specifies the location of the local source code directory. In this case, the script uses the directory where it's currently running, indicated by `.`.

The terminal also shows the build output.

## Deploy changes to AKS

When the build finishes, run the following script in the terminal to update the existing AKS cluster with the new configuration.

```bash
./update-aks.sh
```

The preceding script uses `helm` commands to:

- Uninstall the *:::no-loc text="WebStatus":::*, *:::no-loc text="WebSPA":::*, and aggregator Helm charts from the AKS deployment.
- Install the reconfigured *:::no-loc text="WebStatus":::* and aggregator Helm charts by using a public container registry.
- Install the new *:::no-loc text="Coupon.API":::* chart and the reconfigured *:::no-loc text="WebSPA":::* chart by using your private container registry.

The terminal shows the `helm uninstall` and `helm install` commands with the correct parameters.

## Verify changes

After the updated app installs and is online, verify that the changes were successful. First, go to the *:::no-loc text="WebStatus":::* page and observe the status of the changed services. Notice that the unchanged services remain healthy throughout the redeployment of the new and changed services.

When the services are all healthy, go to the *WebSPA* URL, and follow these steps:
1. Refresh the browser.
1. If you're not signed in, select the **LOGIN** link at upper right and use the credentials provided on the sign-in page.
1. Add your favorite products to the shopping bag by selecting the images.
1. Select the shopping bag icon in the upper right.
1. Select **CHECKOUT**.
1. In the **HAVE A DISCOUNT CODE** field, enter the code *:::no-loc text="DISC-15":::* for a 15 USD discount, and select **APPLY**.

1. Select **PLACE ORDER** to complete the purchase.

Congratulations! You successfully added the coupon service to the :::no-loc text="eShopOnContainers"::: app.
