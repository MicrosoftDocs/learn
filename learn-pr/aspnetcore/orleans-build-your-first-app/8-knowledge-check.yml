  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
    - content: "What are grains in the context of Orleans?"
      choices:
        - content: "Grains are streams that help developers process large series of data in real-time."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. Streams are a separate feature of Orleans that can utilize grains."
        - content: "Grains manage collections of silos and the communication between them."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. A collection of silos is called a cluster."
        - content: "Grains are virtual actors comprised of a user-defined identity, behavior, and state."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct. Grains are entities that manage behavior and state."
        - content: "Grains handle implementation details for different storage options for persistent state, such as Azure Blob Storage."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. Storage providers implement different storage services that grains can utilize."
    - content: "Which of the following methods is NOT defined on the `IPersistentState` interface?"
      choices:
        - content: "`WriteStateAsync`"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. `WriteStatAsync` is defined on `IPersistentState`."
        - content: "`ReadStateAsync`"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. `ReadStateAsync` is defined on `IPersistentState`."
        - content: "`ClearStateAsync`"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. `ClearStateAsync` is defined on `IPersistentState`."
        - content: "`DeleteStateAsync`"
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct. `DeleteStateAsync` isn't defined on `IPersistentState`."
    - content: "Which attribute should be applied to a grain constructor parameter to enable saving the state of the object?"
      choices:
        - content: "`StateFactory`"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. There's no `StateFactory` attribute available in Orleans."
        - content: "`PersistentState`"
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct. `PersistentState` is the correct attribute to store state data."
        - content: "`IGrainWithStringKey`"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. `IGrainWithStringKey` is used to provide grains with a string identifier."
        - content: "`GrainState`"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. There's no `GrainState` attribute available in Orleans."
    - content: "Which of the following lists of events accurately represents the order of a grain lifecycle?"
      choices:
        - content: "Activating → Active → Deactivating → Persisted"
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct. This list is the correct order of events in the grain life cycle."
        - content: "Active → Persisted → Recycled"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. This list isn't the correct order of events in the grain life cycle."
        - content: "Activating → Inactive → Persisted"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. This list isn't the correct order of events in the grain life cycle."
        - content: "Active → Deactivating → Recycled → Initializing"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. This list isn't the correct order of events in the grain life cycle."
