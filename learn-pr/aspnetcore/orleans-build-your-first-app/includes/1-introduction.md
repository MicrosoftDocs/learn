Orleans is a cross-platform framework designed to simplify building scalable, distributed, cloud-native applications. Orleans runs anywhere that .NET is supported and integrates well with other platform features.

## Build cloud-native, distributed applications

Suppose you work for a team that is building a set of utilities for a social platform. One of those tools includes a URL shortener web service. Users can submit a full URL to the app, which will return a shortened version they can share with others, who will then be redirected to the full site.

The app is expected to serve many customers and should scale reliably while managing state and persisting the redirect data for future use. Technical leadership would like to design the app to be cloud-native, meaning it's able to effectively apply cloud features like scalability, elasticity and resiliency. Implementing these features from the ground up can be challenging, so you would like to use Orleans to streamline development with a standardized approach.

## What will we be doing?

This module demonstrates how to build a small but scalable URL shortening app using Orleans. You'll learn how to use core features of Orleans such as grains and silos to manage data. You'll also see how to consume that data using clients, perform essential configurations and persist state.

## What is the main goal?

By the end of this module, you'll understand how to use Orleans to build cloud ready, distributed application with .NET.
