  questions:
    - content: "Suppose you want to add an `IsEmployee` claim to the authenticated user. By default, where is that claim persisted?"
      choices:
      - content: "All user claims are stored in the `AspNetUsers` table."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "The `AspNetUsers` table is intended for storage of user profile data. While claims could be stored here, customization is needed to do so."
      - content: "All user claims are stored in the `AspNetUserClaims` table."
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "Identity's `UserManager<TUser>` class contains `AddClaimAsync` and `AddClaimsAsync` methods, which store a claim or claims, respectively. Claims are stored in the `AspNetUserClaims` table."
      - content: "All user claims are persisted in memory using session state."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Session state is transient and scoped to the lifetime of the session. Session state data isn't persisted to a data store."
    - content: "Which of the following options is a Microsoft-supported data store for Identity with EF Core?"
      choices:
      - content: "SQL Server"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "SQL Server is one example of a Microsoft-supported data store."
      - content: "SQLite"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "SQLite is one example of a Microsoft-supported data store."
      - content: "SQL Server and SQLite"
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "Identity supports both SQL Server and SQLite out-of-the-box with no third-party packages."
    - content: "Identity creates a cookie named *.AspNetCore.Identity.Application* to preserve a user session. By default, when is the cookie created and when is it deleted?"
      choices:
      - content: "The cookie is created when the user navigates to the login page. The cookie is destroyed when the browser is closed."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Successful authentication on the login page is required to create the cookie. By default, the user must explicitly log out before the cookie is deleted. The `isPersistent` parameter of the `SignInManager<TUser>` class's `SignInAsync` method is used to configure deletion of the cookie upon browser close."
      - content: "The cookie is created after successfully authenticating on the login page. The cookie is destroyed when the **Logout** link is clicked."
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "The `SignInManager<TUser>` class is responsible for managing the cookie. The `SignInAsync` and `SignOutAsync` methods are used for cookie creation and deletion, respectively."
      - content: "The cookie is created when the user navigates to the login page. The cookie is destroyed when the **Logout** link is clicked."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Successful authentication on the login page is required to create the cookie."
