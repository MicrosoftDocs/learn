        - content: ".NET Familiarity"
          isCorrect: false

          explanation: "While this scenario might not be a complex application, it isn't a deciding factor in this scenario."
    - content: "A customer requested that you build a web application that needs to run in a validated state in order to meet requirements of the FDA. Which of these criteria indicates you should build with Blazor Server?"
      choices:
        - content: "Integration Requirements"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "While you may be integrating with other applications and logic, this doesn't require the application run on the server."
        - content: "Code Security Requirements"
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Blazor Server is an application configuration where all code executes on the server, and only user-interface updates are sent to the browser."
        - content: "Complexity of the Application"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "While this scenario describes a complex application, it's not the primary reason to build with Blazor Server."

      choices:
        - content: "Integration Requirements"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "While you may not be asked to integrate with existing .NET resources, this isn't the primary reason to choose a solution other than Blazor."
        - content: "Code Security Requirements"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "While your application may need to be secured and run on a server as Blazor Server can, you should instead prefer to use Node and the tools with which you're already familiar."
        - content: ".NET Familiarity"
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Blazor exposes techniques and interactions that are common for .NET developers to use. Developers who are more familiar with other technologies should use those technologies with which they're more familiar."
