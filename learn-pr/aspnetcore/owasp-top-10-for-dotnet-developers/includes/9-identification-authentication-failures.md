The identification and authentication failures category covers weaknesses in confirming a user's identity, authentication, and session management in protection against authentication-related attacks.

As we discussed earlier, authentication is a process in which a user provides credentials that are then compared to credentials stored by the identity provider. If the credentials match, users authenticate successfully, and can then perform actions that they're authorized for. Authorization refers to the process that determines what a user is allowed to do.

There are many techniques attackers use to exploit broken authentication. The result can be temporary or permanent information leaks or account hijacking.

> Follow [Security Development Lifecycle](https://www.microsoft.com/securityengineering/sdl/practices) and [Operational Security](https://www.microsoft.com/securityengineering/osa/practices) best practices to ensure Multifactor Authentication, Zero Trust, and established Design Requirements are in place.

You should adequately protect and correctly implement operations related to user identity, authentication, or session management.

Luckily, the [ASP.NET Core and Entity Framework](/aspnet/core/security) contains features to help you secure your apps and prevent security breaches. For example, the ASP.NET Model-View Controller (MVC) framework has a built-in helper method, which can add antiforgery tokens to your Razor pages:

``` razor
@using (Html.BeginForm("Manage", "Account")) {
    @Html.AntiForgeryToken()
}
```

Cross-site scripting is a common attack technique. Cross-site scripting works by tricking your application into inserting a `<script>` tag into your rendered page, or by inserting an `On*` event into an element.
Never put untrusted data into your HTML input. Untrusted data is any data that an attacker can control. HTML form inputs, query strings, HTTP headers, and even data sourced from a database might enable an attacker to breach your database even if they can't breach your application.

Before putting untrusted data into a URL query string, ensure its URL is encoded. HTML encoding takes characters such as `<` and changes them into a safe form like `&lt`. Don't make authorization decisions based on the state of the UI, but only from the component state. Consider using Content Security Policy (CSP) to protect against cross-site scripting attacks.

### Code review notes

As part of your code review, you decided to analyze the Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) configuration of your app. The same-origin policy is a browser security feature that prevents a web page from making requests to a different domain than the one that served the web page, preventing man-in-the-middle attacks.

Your review showed you that confirming the user’s identity, authentication, and session management is critical to protecting against authentication–related attacks.

The Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL) enables developers to acquire security tokens from the Microsoft identity platform to authenticate users and access-secured web APIs. You can use it to provide secure access to Microsoft Graph, other Microsoft APIs, third-party web APIs, or your own web API. MSAL supports many different application architectures and platforms including .NET, JavaScript, Java, Python, Android, and iOS.
