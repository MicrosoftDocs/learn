  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:   
  - content: "It's considered to be good practice to come up with your own, home-grown encryption algorithm?"  
    choices:
    - content: "Yes."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Rely on industry standard encryption and hashing implementations. Review the documentation to ensure you're using strong algorithms."
    - content: "No."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Rely on industry standard encryption and hashing implementations. Review the documentation to ensure you're using strong algorithms."    


  - content: "Process of converting data to a different format to protect the integrity of data for storage, transmission, compression or decompression best describes"  
    choices:    
    - content: "Encryption."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Encryption deals with maintaining confidentiality and integrity of the data by converting the data into an unreadable format to protect it from unauthorized access."    
    - content: "Hashing."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Hashing is a one-way cryptographic function while encryption and encoding is designed to work both ways."
    - content: "Encoding."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct!"
