          isCorrect: false
          explanation: This feature is not generic. It's specific to Azure Cosmos DB managed data service instance.
    - content: Which is the key feature of Azure Cache for Redis?
      choices:
        - content: Data persistence and geo-replication for Premium tier.
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: With Premium tier instance, you can persist the data to mitigate the potential data loss and use the geo-replication feature to distribute the cache data in multiple regions. 
        - content: Provides an in-memory data store based.

    - content: Which is the key feature of Azure Cosmos DB?
      choices:
        - content: Single-digit millisecond latencies with guaranteed speed at any scale.
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: Azure Cosmos DB is a fully managed NoSQL database for modern app development. Single-digit millisecond response times, and automatic and instant scalability, guaranteed speed at any scale.
        - content: Not good for mission-critical applications.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Azure Cosmos DB is a good choice for a mission-critical application because of SLA-backed speed, availability, throughput, and consistency.
        - content: Apache Spark API.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Azure Cosmos DB doesn't support Apache Spark API. Instead, it provides APIs for Core (SQL), MongoDB, Cassandra, Azure Table, and Gremlin (graph).
