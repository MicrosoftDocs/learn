This module explores creating a cross-platform RESTful service using ASP.NET Core web API Controllers with .NET and C#.

This module uses the [.NET CLI (Command Line Interface)](/dotnet/core/tools/) and [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) for local development. After completing this module, you can apply its concepts using a development environment like Visual Studio (Windows), Visual Studio for Mac (macOS), or continued development using Visual Studio Code (Windows, Linux, & macOS). 

## Example Scenario

Suppose you're an employee of a pizza company named Contoso Pizza. Your manager has asked you to develop a RESTful pizza inventory management service as a prerequisite for the company's web storefront and mobile application. The service has to support adding, viewing, modifying, and removing types of pizza&mdash; a standardized usage of HTTP action verbs better known as **C**reate, **R**ead, **U**pdate, **D**elete (CRUD).

## What will we be doing?

In this module, you'll create a new web API application using ASP.NET Core, and how to run and test it from the command line. Then, you'll add a data store and a new API controller. Finally, you'll implement and test the API methods to create, read, update, and delete pizzas from the data store.

## What is the main goal?

By the end of this session, you'll be able to create new web API applications with ASP.NET Core, and to create API controllers that implement basic CRUD logic.
