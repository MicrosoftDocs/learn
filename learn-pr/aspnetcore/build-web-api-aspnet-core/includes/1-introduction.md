This module explores creating a cross-platform RESTful service by using ASP.NET Core web API controllers with .NET and C#.

In this module, we use the [.NET CLI (command-line interface)](/dotnet/core/tools/) and [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) for local development. After you complete this module, you can apply its concepts by using a development environment like Visual Studio (Windows). You can also apply the concepts to continued development through Visual Studio Code (Windows, Linux, and macOS).

## Example scenario

Suppose you're an employee of a pizza company named Contoso Pizza. Your manager has asked you to develop a RESTful service for pizza inventory management as a prerequisite for the company's web storefront and mobile application. The service has to support adding, viewing, modifying, and removing types of pizza; a standardized usage of HTTP verbs better known as *create, read, update, delete* (CRUD).

## What will we be doing?

In this module, you create a new web API application by using ASP.NET Core, and learn how to run and test it from the command line. Then, you add a data store and a new API controller. Finally, you implement and test the API methods to create, read, update, and delete pizzas from the data store.

## What's the main goal?

By the end of this session, you're able to create new web API applications by using ASP.NET Core, and you've learned how to create API controllers that implement basic CRUD logic.
