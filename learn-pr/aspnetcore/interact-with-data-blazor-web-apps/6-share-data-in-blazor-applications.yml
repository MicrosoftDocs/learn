  questions:
  - content: "Blazor components can receive input by using two types of parameters. What are they?"
    choices:
    - content: "Parameter and DescendingParameter"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "DescendingParameter sounds like the other parameter type but it isn't a real type in Blazor."
    - content: "Parameter and RequiredParameter"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "RequiredParameter doesn't define a different parameter type that can be injected into a Blazor component."
    - content: "Parameter and CascadingParameter"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Parameters pass data directly into a component, and CascadingParameter passes data indirectly into a child component."
  - content: "AppState can be registered with the service locator by using which of these statements?"
    choices:
    - content: "`builder.Services.AddAppState()`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "AddAppState isn't a method available with the Blazor framework."
    - content: "`builder.Services.AddServerSideBlazor()`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This method enables Server Side Blazor in the application, but it doesn't register the AppState."
    - content: "`builder.Services.AddScoped<PizzaSalesState>()`"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "This method registers the PizzaSalesState object as a scoped service that can be used within Blazor pages and components."
