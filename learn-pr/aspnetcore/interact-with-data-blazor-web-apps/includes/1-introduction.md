Blazor creates interactive web applications by using .NET code. It allows you to share app logic on both the server and client side, without the complexity of managing client-side JavaScript libraries.

Suppose a pizza delivery firm hires you to modernize its customer-facing website. You're given webpage mockups from graphic designers, and you discuss the site functionality in detail with all the stakeholders. Now, you want to begin building the site with the main pizza-browsing pages. Your team has many years of C# experience, but is less experienced with JavaScript, so you want to write as much code as possible in .NET. In later modules in this learning path, you build the checkout and authentication pages.

In this module, you learn about Blazor components, and how to use them to create a user interface that displays dynamic data.

## Learning objectives

By the end of this module, you're able to:

- Assemble a user interface for a web app by creating Blazor components.
- Access data to display in your web app.
- Share data in your web app between multiple Blazor components.
- Bind an HTML element to a variable in a Blazor component.
