You're working for a pizza delivery company that wants a new website, and you have a team with years of experience in C#. By choosing Blazor, you can write client-side and server-side code in C# and minimize JavaScript code.

Before Blazor, you looked at having to invest in training your developers in JavaScript and other web technologies. Now this training isn't as necessary, and Blazor can help to accelerate your web application development projects.

After completing this module, you learned how to:

- Assemble a user interface for a web app by creating Blazor components.
- Access data to display in your web app.
- Share data in your web app between multiple Blazor components.
- Bind an HTML element to a variable in a Blazor component.
