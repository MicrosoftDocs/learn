quiz:
  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "In which Blazor event handler is a good place to fetch data?"
    choices:
    - content: "PageLoad"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "PageLoad is an event handler from ASP.NET Web Forms and isn't available in Blazor."
    - content: "OnInitializedAsync"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Blazor apps initialize their user interface in the OnInitializedAsync event handler and are a great place to fetch data to present on the page."
    - content: "OnAfterRenderAsync"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "OnAfterRenderAsync is a Blazor event handler that runs after each time the Blazor runtime updates the user interface and is too late in the render process to fetch data without a visible repainting of the user interface."
  - content: "Which Blazor directive should you use to work with a data access service on a Blazor page?"
    choices:
    - content: "@inject"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "The @inject directive makes services available that are registered with the service locator."
    - content: "@page"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The @page directive instructs the Blazor runtime that the .razor file can be navigated to and doesn't make services available to the code on the page."
    - content: "@using"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The @using directive is used the same way as the `using` statement in .cs files and doesn't make instances of services available to the code on the page."
