  questions:
    - content: "Which built-in SignalR hub protocol should you use to reduce message sizes?"
      choices:
        - content: "MessagePack"
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct! The MessagePack hub protocol provides an alternative to the default JSON protocol, and it produces smaller messages."
        - content: "JSON"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. The JSON hub protocol is the default protocol and is human readable, but it's uncompressed and has larger messages than its binary counterpart."
        - content: "BlazorPack"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. Although BlazorPack is a binary protocol, it's available only with the Blazor server hosting model."
    - content: "A client can send and receive messages to and from the server with what SignalR type?"
      choices:
        - content: "`IHubContext<THub>`"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. The `IHubContext<IHub>` type is a server concept that represents a specific `Hub`, outside the hub instance itself."
        - content: "`HubConnection`"
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct! The `HubConnection` type is built from `HubConnectionBuilder`, and its connection enables clients to send and receive messages."
        - content: "`SynchronizationContext`"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. The `SynchronizationContext` type provides the basic functionality for propagating a synchronization context in various synchronization models, but it's unrelated to SignalR."
    - content: "A server can't fire events from which SignalR type?"
      choices:
        - content: "`Hub`"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. The `Hub` and `Hub<T>` types can fire events in addition to exposing methods."
        - content: "`IHubContext<IHub>`"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. The `IHubContext<IHub>` type can be used to fire events."
        - content: "`HubConnection`"
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct! The `HubConnection` type is a _client_ concept and can't fire events directly."
    - content: "SignalR is not ideal in what types of apps?"
      choices:
        - content: "Apps that require high-frequency updates."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. SignalR would be perfect for these types of apps to provide real-time web functionality."
        - content: "Apps with sparse or unreliable internet connectivity."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct! SignalR is only as durable as the underlying connection. When connectivity is a primary concern, SignalR is probably not ideal."
        - content: "Apps that are designed for collaborating, monitoring, or based on notifications."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. SignalR would be perfect for these types of apps to provide real-time web functionality."
    - content: "When the server supports WebSockets but the client supports only Long Polling, which transport is used?"
      choices:
        - content: "WebSockets"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. If the client doesn't support WebSockets, graceful fallback attempts Server-Sent Events and then Long Polling."
        - content: "Server-Sent Events"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. If the client doesn't support WebSockets or Server-Sent Events, only Long Polling is available."
        - content: "Long Polling"
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct! Long Polling is used, because it's the lowest common denominator of potential transports."
    - content: "With a SignalR connection, which of the following statements is true?"
      choices:
        - content: "Messages can be sent only from clients to the server."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. Although clients can send messages to the server, the server can also send messages to clients."
        - content: "Messages can be sent only from the server to the clients."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. Although the server can send messages to clients, clients can also send messages to the server."
        - content: "Both clients and the server can send messages to each other (duplex communication)."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct! SignalR creates a duplex communication in which the server and clients can send messages to each other."
