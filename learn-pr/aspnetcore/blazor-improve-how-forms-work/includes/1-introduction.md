Blazor enables you to create interactive web applications using .NET. You can share app logic on both the server side and client side without the complexity of managing client-side JavaScript libraries.

Suppose that a pizza-delivery firm hires you to enhance their customer-facing website. You're asked to improve the customers' experience when entering their address details in orders. Specifically, the company needs to stop blank addresses from appearing on orders. Some were recorded in the past and resulted in poor service to customers.

In this module, you learn about Blazor event handlers and how to use the power of Blazor forms with validation.

## Learning objectives

By the end of this session, you're able to:

- Improve your app's interactivity using Blazor event handlers.
- Use Blazor forms to enable data entry.
- Extend Blazor forms with server and client-side validation.
