In this exercise, you move the static data from the app into a mock server, and then you use the actual server.

## Prepare code to fetch data from mock server

At this point, you have a front-end app with static data inside of the app. You want to move the static data into a mock server, while you're waiting for the back-end team to finish building the API. Performing this step sets you up nicely for using the actual API, once it's done.

1. In _Pizza.jsx_, replace the code with the following code:

    :::code language="javascript" source="../code/with-components-and-fetch/Pizza.jsx":::

    The data is fetched with a call to a mocked API instead of a front-end app's in-memory array. Notice that the URL used is `/pizzas` without the reference to the back-end server. This is because a proxy makes the requests toward the mocked API.

1. Create a file named _db.json_ in the _PizzaClient_ directory. Insert the following content:

    :::code language="json" source="../code/mock-server/db.json" :::

   This is a JSON representation of the mocked Pizza data.
 
## Prepare proxy to mock server

1. In the Visual Studio Code panel, typically found below the editor region, select **Ports**. 

1. Find the local address for the API on port 5100. Hover over the address and select the copy icon.

    :::image type="content" source="..//media/visual-studio-code-panel-port-copy.png" alt-text="{alt-text}":::

1. Paste this value as the proxy property in the Vite React **vite.config.js** so the front-end app uses the correct server port.

    :::code language="javascript" source="../code/with-components-and-fetch/vite.config.js":::

    Vite reloads the React app to use the new proxy configuration.

## Start the mock server

1. Right-click on the **PizzaClient** subfolder and select **Open in integrated terminal**. 
1. Start the mock API with the following command in that new terminal.

    ```bash
    npx json-server --watch --port 5100 db.json
    ```

    Running this code starts the mock server, and output similar to the following appears:

   ```output
   \{^_^}/ hi!
   Loading db.json
   Done
    
   Resources
   http://localhost:5100/pizzas
    
   Home
   http://localhost:5100
   ```

1. Use your app in the browser to fetch data from the mock API. Create, update, and delete pizzas to make sure the changes work. 

1. Use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd> to stop the mock server.

## Prepare code to fetch data from .NET API server

Suppose the back-end team has now finished building the server. To use the server, you just need to fetch the code from GitHub and run it and configure CORS as well.

1. The back-end project is in the PizzaStore subdirectory. Right-click on that subdirectory and select **Open in integrated terminal.**.

1. Run `dotnet ef database` to apply the migrations to create a database with tables.

   ```bash
   dotnet ef database update
   ```

   > [!NOTE]
   > If the `dotnet ef` can't be found, install it with `dotnet tool install -g dotnet-ef` then repeat the previous command.

1. In the file explorer, browse to the _PizzaStore_ directory, and open _Program.cs_. Replace with the following code to enable CORS (the CORS-related code is highlighted):

   :::code language="csharp" source="../code/dot-net-server/Program-cs-full.cs" highlight="14-27,38,39":::

   The changes configure CORS. You'll be able to read and write toward the API, despite the front-end app and API running on different ports.

## Prepare proxy to .NET API server URL

1. In the Visual Studio Code panel, typically found below the editor region, select **Ports**. The **Ports** panel appears.

1. Find the local address for the API on port 5100. Hover over the address and select the copy icon.

    :::image type="content" source="..//media/visual-studio-code-panel-port-copy.png" alt-text="{alt-text}":::

1. Paste this value as the proxy property in the Vite React **vite.config.js** so the front-end app uses the correct server port.

## Start the .NET Core API server

1. In the integrated terminal for the **PizzaStore** subfolder, start the .NET Core API in the terminal. The server runs on port 5100.

    ```dotnetcli
    dotnet run
    ```

1. In the open browser, use the app, it displays one item with the title, _Pepperoni_. 
1. When you are done testing the app, leave the browser open and let the front-end React app run in the terminal. You can also let the .NET Core API server run in the terminal. You'll use them again in the next exercise.

Congratulations, you've created a full stack application! The React front-end app is reading data from a back-end database via a minimal API.
