In this module, you explored how to build a front-end app. You considered that different teams might be involved in creating front-end and back-end parts. For example, if the back-end team takes time implementing its parts, you learned that you might need to rely on mocked data while you wait.

After that, we approached the fact that front-end and back-end parts could be created by different teams. If, for example, the back-end team takes time to implement their parts, then you might need to rely on mocked data.

Finally, we discussed how to connect the front-end and the back-end and how you initially would run into problems with CORS. CORS is really about protecting your API from requests from domains that are not allowed. By configuring CORS properly, you can make your back-end allowlist the domain your front-end app is running on.
