  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
    - content: "What are grains in the context of Orleans?"
      choices:
        - content: "Grains are streams that help developers process large sets of data in near real-time."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. Streams are a separate feature of Orleans from grains."
        - content: "Grains manage collections of silos and the communication between them."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. A collection of silos is called a cluster."
        - content: "Grains are virtual actors comprised of a user-defined identity, behavior and state."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct. Grains are entities that manage behavior and state."
        - content: "Grains handle implementation details for different storage options for persistent state, such as Azure Blob Storage."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. Storage providers implement different storage services that can be utilized by grains."
    - content: "Which Orleans component is responsible for creating and retrieving grains?"
      choices:
        - content: "An implementation of `ISiloBuilder`."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. `ISiloBuilder` implementations are used to configure silos."
        - content: "An implementation of `IGrainWithStringKey`."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. `IGrainWithStringKey` is used to provide an identifier for grains."
        - content: "An implementation of `IGrainManager`."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. `GrainManager` isn't a real class in Orleans."
        - content: "An implementation of `IGrainFactory`."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct. Grain factories are used to create and manage grains."
    - content: "You would like to track and retrieve a grain using a string identifier. How would you handle this in Orleans?"
      choices:
        - content: "Add a `[StringGrain]` attribute to the class definition."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. This attribute doesn't exist in Orleans."
        - content: "Register the grain as a string type as part of the Orleans configuration in _Program.cs_"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. Grain types aren't registered in _Program.cs_."
        - content: "Include a string ID parameter when creating the grain using the grain factory."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. The grain's identifier type isn't set by the grain factory."
        - content: "Implement the `IGrainWithStringKey` interface on your grain class."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct. `IGrainWithStringKey` defines the type of ID for your grain."
    - content: "What is an Orleans silo?"
      choices:
        - content: "A component used to process large sets of data."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. Orleans streams are used to process large sets of data."
        - content: "A component used to store and manage grains."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct. Grains are stored in silos."
        - content: "A class used to create and retrieve grains."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. Grain factories are used to create and manage grains."
        - content: "A type of base class every grain should inherit from."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. Grains should inherit from the `Grain` base class."
