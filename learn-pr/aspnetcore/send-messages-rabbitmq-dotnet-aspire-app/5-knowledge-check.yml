quiz:
  questions:
  - content: "You're setting up a RabbitMQ message channel. You want to distribute all messages to all the subscribers without any filters. What kind of exchange should you create?"
    choices:
    - content: "Direct"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A direct exchange applies filters to messages so you can govern which queues and consumers receive them."
    - content: "Topic"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A topic exchange applies filters with wildcards to messages so you can flexibly govern which queues and consumers receive them."
    - content: "Fanout"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. When you use a fanout exchange, messages are copied to all the subscribers."
  - content: "You add a RabbitMQ container in your app host project and pass it to a consuming project. In the consumer, how can you obtain a connection to the RabbitMQ service?"
    choices:
    - content: "Call the AddRabbitMQClient() method and then use dependency injection."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Once you've called the AddRabbitMQClient() method, you can get the connection that the app host passed to your consuming project by using dependency injection in the object where you want to send or receive messages."
    - content: "Call the AddRabbitMQ() method."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. You use the AddRabbitMQ() method in the app host to create a RabbitMQ service, not in the consuming project."
    - content: "Call the CreateModel() method."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. You use the CreateModel() method to set up a messaging channel after you obtain the connection."
