**What is AI?**

The term AI tends to be thrown around a lot. Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning or Deep Learning are common terms that confuse many people. So, what are they anyway? In this unit, we will clarify these methods so you can understand how it applies to your business problem.

* Artificial Intelligence (AI) is an ability of computer program or machine exhibited or mimic human-like behavior (for example, visual senses, speech recognition, decision-making, natural language understanding etc.).

* Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI. Machine learning is a technique where a machine sifts through numerous of data to find patterns over time. Machine learning uses algorithms that train a machine how to learn patterns based on differentiating features about the data. The more the training data, the more accurate the predictions. Here are some examples:
  * Email spam detection. Machine Learning could look at patterns where email has words like "free" or "guarantee". Email address domain is on a blocked-list. A link displayed in text doesn't match the URL behind it.
  * Credit Card fraud detection. Machine Learning could look at patterns like the spending in a zip code the owner doesn't usually visit; buying a big-ticket item; or a sudden shopping spree.
* Deep Learning (DL) is a subset of Machine Learning. Deep Learning is imitating how a human brain processes information known as a connected artificial neural network. Unlike machine learning, deep learning can discover complex patterns and differentiating features about the data on its own. It normally works with unstructured data like images, text, and audio. That’s why it requires enormous amounts of data for better analysis and massive computing power for speed. For instance:
  * Detecting cancerous cells in medical images. Deep learning scans every pixel in the image as input to the neural nodes. The nodes analyze each pixel to filter out features that look cancerous. Each layer of nodes pushes its findings of potential cancerous cells to the next layer of node to repeat the process and eventually aggregate all its finding to classify what the image is. For example, a healthy image vs an image with cancerous features found.

Expanding on the primary concepts of AI, where machines show capabilities that are usually associated with human capabilities, you can see how learning over time, interpreting data, and reasoning with data works. To achieve this, we need to feed the machine a lot of data before it can learn. Additionally, machine learning creates algorithms varying from simple linear functions to extremely complex ones, like an artificial neural network.
Next, let’s explore how to use Pre-built AI technologies that make learning, perception, and cognition easier.
