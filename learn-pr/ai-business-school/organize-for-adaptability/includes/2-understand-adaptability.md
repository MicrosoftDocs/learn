Being adaptable is easier said than done. Before you can pivot and redirect projects, policies, or business models, you have to understand the value of doing so, take stock of preparedness, and provide strategic direction.

## What does “being adaptable” really mean?

When we think about what it means to be adaptable, we might think about adjusting behaviors to new conditions or modifying products for new use. It sounds pretty textbook, but in practice, there are far more implications to consider.  

Technology—and the world around us—is constantly changing. Adapting to this means recognizing when to let go of things that aren't working, adopting a willingness to experiment and sometimes fail, and learning to juggle conflicting priorities. For example, we have to adapt to new technology while simultaneously using it to become something else. We have to use it to both *combat* disruption and *create* disruption—and we have to do all of this while remaining profitable and fair. It's a paradox that poses a question all organizations need to consider: what role does technology play in adaptability? Does it enable or disrupt—or both? And why does it matter?

## Resilience is more than just recovery

In short, technology is both an enabler and a disruptor. It enables people to come together and innovate in ways that may otherwise not be possible—and during times of crisis when adapting to change is the only way to navigate it. But technology also disrupts and often alters entire landscapes of how consumers interact with products and services and how businesses and their competitors react.  

That brings us back to the question of why it matters: it’s because even in the midst of change, your customers still rely on you to meet their needs—and technology alone isn’t enough to do that. Businesses must understand how they can use technology to innovate in ways that both enable recovery and disrupt the market to gain a competitive edge post-crisis. Resilience, after all, is about more than just bouncing back—it’s about pulling ahead, too.  

To this end, research<sup>1</sup> shows that organizations should consider various areas of their business that could be strengthened and accelerated by technology. Within many of these areas, adaptability is key to progress. Let’s look at two, for example:

* **Protecting and growing the top line—** This should be front and center as you navigate an evolving market. It’s critical to quickly identify and address changing customer needs using data-driven and digital marketing, sales, and pricing.
* **Developing agile operations—** Developing agile operations ensures your organization can manage disruptions in supply chain, logistics, manufacturing, development, and corporate functions. Doing so enables continuity of business, a critical aspect of surviving disruption.

In both of these examples, successful organizations are those that adapt to quickly changing external factors that are often beyond their control. They innovate with technology to meet new demands and ensure operations continue through alternative processes or programs. The organizations that pursue and succeed in these areas of business do so because they've already learned to adapt. They've learned to use both technology and planning to their advantage, and, critically, they've prepared employees to collaborate so that adaptability becomes a collective achievement.  

Next, let’s consider some of the strategies and frameworks you might apply to help organize your internal systems for adaptability and innovation.
