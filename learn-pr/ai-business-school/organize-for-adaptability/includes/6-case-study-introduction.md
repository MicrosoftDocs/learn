## Abstract

This case study describes how HOCHTIEF harnessed innovation through startup-like environments—including their innovation hub Nexplore and spin-off EDGITAL—to revolutionize existing processes, develop new services, and disrupt the construction industry.

Nearly 150 years old, HOCHTIEF is an international infrastructure company that provides construction and engineering services for public and private customers. From the Metro in Sydney to the Opera House in Krakow, HOCHTIEF is responsible for roads, buildings, and infrastructure all around the world. They're a leader in digital modeling, even though the construction industry is behind others when it comes to digitization. To innovate in the construction space, HOCHTIEF had to deconstruct its own legacy components—processes and services—to build more value for its business and transform the industry.

## Industry context

Construction is a huge industry, comprising more than 11 trillion dollars and about 13 percent of the US GDP—but it’s also an industry with traditional practices and methods historically slow to change. Construction is an industry marked by legacy products, systems, and approaches that have only recently started to innovate with more technologically advanced solutions such as AI and machine learning. Most of the industry’s advancements in innovation are related to faster and more cost-effective building projects. But the industry hasn’t been as proactive in sharing and learning from successes and failures of such innovation. Leaders of the construction industry are now paying close attention to how they can use innovation to set new standards for conducting business.

## Challenge

Construction is a traditional industry characterized by high competition. It’s relatively new to digitization processes since every construction project is unique and there's no such thing as serial production.

HOCHTIEF was dealing with industry-wide challenges including competition, fragmentation, and changing conditions. Given that the company is involved in a wide range of construction projects, from design to operations and maintenance, it was sitting on a massive well of untapped data waiting to be captured and used.

In terms of data collection and road condition analysis in particular, construction authorities typically must manually inspect roads for damage using heavy and expensive equipment. Information gathering is infrequent, as it often takes a long time to gather. For example, Germany’s road network alone is almost 20 times the circumference of the Earth. If you walked along the routes in a city, equipped only with a pencil and a notepad, it might take several years to gather inspection data.

HOCHTIEF knew they needed to address silos in their teams and better manage data to create business value and disrupt the industry. They examined these problems in their industry and decided to build a comprehensive platform for innovation to make their business more competitive. They also decided to create new business models and drive revenue streams, while spinning off innovation arms to take them further. They turned to technologies like AI, blockchain, and more, to revolutionize existing processes and develop new services—ultimately driving HOCHTIEF into Industry 4.0 and beyond.

## Questions for consideration

1. How could HOCHTIEF ensure they are accounting for the associated challenges for each new project?
1. How can companies interested in digitizing develop structures around their data while simultaneously building organizational support for innovative initiatives?
1. In what ways can companies encourage a culture of innovation to ensure their initiatives both solve existing problems and have legs for long-term success?
1. How could HOCHTIEF avoid creating silos throughout their process of digitization?  
1. AI is a powerful tool to make businesses more competitive. How can companies use AI strategically to differentiate their organization from competitors?
1. What best practices for AI should HOCHTIEF prioritize to make sure they have the right approach to implementing their AI solutions?

Now let’s take a look at how HOCHTIEF used innovative technologies like AI to approach common industry challenges.
