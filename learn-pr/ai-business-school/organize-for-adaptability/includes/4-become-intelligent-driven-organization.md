Laying the groundwork for innovation is often part of a larger digital transformation effort, one that uses emerging technologies like AI to recalibrate an entire organization around collecting, analyzing, and using data.

Data adoption isn’t a one-time fix—it’s a journey. Years of experience in this realm led us to develop the Intelligence Driven Organization (IDO) model, a strategic conversation framework to help our customers achieve their digital transformation goals. It provides a roadmap for designing the processes that generate business outcomes. It also helps organizations build the capabilities to digitalize those processes. Then they can be implemented, monitored, measured, and continuously improved over time, creating digital feedback loops.

These digital feedback loops are flows of information that emerge when a business process—like a customer interaction or back-office operation—has been redesigned around data. Whatever the circumstance, the related data is collected and used to optimize that process by AI-enabled applications.

Crucially, all information can be surfaced to the business processes that need it. In turn, this enables organizations to be more productive at scale and become increasingly customer-centric, which ultimately helps inform their ability to innovate.

The IDO model makes digital feedback loops a reality with four key steps:

* Develop an executive strategy that will see an intelligence-driven culture take root.  
* Ensure the right technical capabilities are in place.
* Ensure your day-to-day execution is enabled by an agile operating model.
* Envision and prioritize a set of future business use cases that represent the desired business outcomes.

Following the four steps helps organizations overcome common obstacles such as shortage of data science skills, difficulty envisioning the right business use cases, and a culture that struggles to understand the need to be data-driven.

By becoming a business driven by data and AI, companies can build the foundation they need to innovate and face the challenges of the future.

Next, we’ll examine how your business can navigate the complexities of—and benefit from—restructuring operations to support an evolving work environment.
