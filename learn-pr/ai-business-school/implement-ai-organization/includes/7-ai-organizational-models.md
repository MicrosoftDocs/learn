In the module "Understand the importance of building an AI-ready culture," we covered the key elements of an AI-ready culture and the importance of effective change management from leadership. Introducing AI doesn't just change an organization's technology. AI creates disruption at the cultural level: it requires people to collaborate in new ways, gain new skills, and adopt new processes. If this transformation isn't handled with care, even the strongest AI strategy will flounder.

The next question is: within your organization, who is responsible for what tasks when it comes to AI? In this unit, we'll dive deeper into how you can assign AI-related responsibilities in your organization.  

## Enabling AI in your organization is a collective responsibility

Everyone has a role to play in AI transformation, not just IT. It's important to empower people from all functions across your company to actively contribute ideas about AI applications. After you've chosen an idea to run with, it's equally important to foster collaboration between business and technical teams when planning design and implementation. After deployment, teams across the technical and operational sides of the business need to be involved in maintaining AI solutions over time:

* Measuring business performance and ROI from the AI solution.
* Monitoring model performance and accuracy.
* Acting on insights gained from an AI solution.
* Addressing issues that arise and deciding how to improve the solution over time.
* Collecting and evaluating feedback from AI users (whether they are customers or employees).

It's the ultimate responsibility of the C-suite to own the overall AI strategy and investment decisions, creating an AI-ready culture, change management, and responsible AI policies.

As for the other leaders across an organization, there's no single model to follow, but we've provided the example below to show how different roles can play a part. You'll need to determine a model that's suited to your strategy and objectives, the teams within your business, and your AI maturity.

### Line of business leader

:::row:::
:::column span="2":::
This person is a business executive responsible for operations of a particular function, line of business, or process within an organization.

* **Source ideas from all employees:** It's important to empower people from every department and level to contribute ideas, ask questions, and make suggestions related to AI. We've discovered that ideas for our most impactful application of AI have come from our employees within business functions, not from outside or above. See the first unit in this module for more information on this topic.
* **Identify new business models:** The real value of AI lies in business transformation: driving new business models, enabling innovative services, creating new revenue streams, and more. For example, Telefónica, one of the world's largest telecommunications companies, used a personalized AI-based assistant to transform its relationships with customers.<sup>4</sup> Ultimately, this increased customer loyalty and satisfaction.

This graphic shows the business roles that are involved with AI initiatives. There are four blue circles with labels underneath them, arranged in a square formation. The first blue circle in the top left is labeled “Business Leader.” In the circle, there is a simple icon of three people standing shoulder to shoulder. In the top right, the blue circle is labeled “Chief Digital Officer.” In the blue circle there is an icon of a person in a suit. In the bottom left circle, labeled “HR,” There is an icon of three people surrounding a single person, to represent support. In the bottom right blue circle, there is an icon of a person next to a computer with a bar graph on it, indicating an upward trend. This blue circle is labeled “IT.”

* **Create optional communities for exchanging ideas:** These communities provide opportunities for IT and business roles to connect on an ongoing basis. This could be done virtually through tools such as Yammer, or in-person at networking events or brown bag sessions.
* **Train business experts to become Agile Product Owners:** A Product Owner is a member of the Agile team responsible for defining the features of the application and streamlining execution. Including this role as part or all of a business expert's responsibilities will allow them to dedicate time and effort to AI initiatives.

### Chief Digital Officer

The Chief Digital Officer (CDO) is a change agent who oversees the transformation of traditional operations using digital processes. Their goal is to generate new business opportunities, revenue streams, and customer services.

* **Cultivate a culture of data sharing across the company:** Most organizations generate, store, and use data in a siloed manner. While each department may have a good view of their own data, they may lack other information that could be relevant to their operations. For instance, a sales department might not have a complete view of a customer because they're missing e-commerce data that's controlled by another department. Sharing data is key to efficiently using AI.
* **Create your AI manifesto:** This is the 'north star' that clearly outlines the organization's vision for AI and digital transformation more broadly. Its goal is not only to solidify the company's strategy, but to inspire everyone across the organization and help them understand what the transformation will mean for them. The CDO will need to work with other members of C-suite to create the document and message it to the company.
* **Identify catalyst projects for quick wins:** Kick-start AI transformation by identifying work that can immediately benefit from AI. Then, showcase those projects to prove its value and gain momentum among other teams.
* **Roll out an education program on data management best practices:** As more people outside of IT become involved in creating AI models, it's important to make sure everyone understands data management best practices. Data needs to be cleaned, consolidated, formatted, and managed so that it's easily consumable by AI. It's extremely important to be careful about what training data is used and how it's structured. Using unsuitable or biased training data negatively affects model performance and fairness. And the need for rigorous processes doesn't end after training—it's also important to plan for monitoring model accuracy over time and retraining them when necessary.

### Human Resources leader

A Human Resources (HR) director makes fundamental contributions to an organization's culture and people development. Their wide-ranging tasks include implementing cultural development, creating internal training programs, and hiring according to the needs of the business.

* **Foster a "learning culture":** Consider how to encourage a culture championed by leadership that embraces challenges and acknowledges failure as a valuable part of continual learning and innovation.
* **Design a "digital leadership" strategy:** Make a plan to help line of business leaders and the C-suite build their own AI literacy and lead teams through AI adoption. 
* **Create a hiring plan for new roles such as data scientists:** While upskilling your employees is the long-term goal, in the short-term you may need to hire some new roles specifically for AI initiatives. New roles that will likely be required include data scientists, software engineers, and DevOps managers.
* **Create a skills plan for roles impacted by AI:** Creating an AI-ready culture requires a sustained commitment from leadership to educate and upskill employees on both the technical and business sides.

  * On the technical side, employees need core skills in building and operationalizing AI applications. It can be helpful to partner with other companies to get your teams up to speed, but AI solutions are never static. They require constant adjustments to exploit new data, new methods, and new opportunities by those who also have an intimate understanding of the business.
  * On the business side, it's important to train people to adopt new processes when an AI-based system changes their day-to-day workflow. This includes teaching them how to interpret and act on AI predictions and recommendations using sound human judgment. Remember to be cognizant of managing that change thoughtfully.

### IT leader

While the Chief Digital Officer is charged with creating and implementing the overall digital strategy, an IT director oversees the day-to-day technology operations.

* **Launch Agile working initiatives between business and IT:** Implementing Agile processes between business and IT teams can help keep those teams aligned around a common goal. This requires a cultural shift to facilitate collaboration and reduce turf wars. Tools such as Microsoft Teams, Skype, and Slack are effective collaboration tools.
* **Create a "dark data" remediation plan:** Dark data is unstructured, untagged, and siloed data that organizations fail to analyze. Across industries, companies stand to benefit greatly if they can bring dark data into the light. To do so, they need a plan to remove data siloes, extract structured information from unstructured content, and clean out unnecessary data. 
* **Set up agile cross-functional delivery teams and projects:** Cross-functional delivery teams are crucial to running successful AI projects. People with intimate knowledge of and control over business goals and processes should be a central part of planning and maintaining AI solutions. Data scientists working in isolation might create models that lack the context, purpose, or value that would make them effective.
* **Scale MLOps across the company:** Managing the entire machine learning (ML) lifecycle at scale is complicated. Organizations need an approach that brings the agility of DevOps to the ML lifecycle. We call this approach MLOps: the practice of collaboration between data scientists, ML engineers, app developers, and other IT teams to manage the end-to-end ML lifecycle. Learn more about MLOps in the previous units of this module.

Now that you've seen how organizations can become AI-ready, let's wrap up everything you've learned with a Knowledge check.
