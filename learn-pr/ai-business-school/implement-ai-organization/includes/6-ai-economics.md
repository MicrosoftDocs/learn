The economics of investing in "traditional" technology initiatives are well understood. Typically, an organization compares the cost of a project with the net present value (NPV) of the benefits. If the NPV is greater than zero and fits within the budget constraints, the project receives a green light.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) requires a different perspective. It's true that if you leverage AI to improve or automate an existing process, then it's possible to measure ROI in the straightforward, traditional way. But there are a few characteristics of AI initiatives that make it difficult to estimate their costs and benefits.

First, custom AI models require upfront investment before it's even possible to measure effectiveness. You can't precisely measure how a custom model will benefit your business until you've prepared data and completed model training and testing. Additionally, it's hard to predict the amount of long-term maintenance a model will need. All models require ongoing monitoring and periodic tuning. But more extensive retraining can be required if circumstances around the initiative change—such as business processes being revamped or the customer market changing significantly. 

The unknowns aren't all negative. Individual models improve over time in ways that are difficult to calculate in advance. And AI solutions may have widespread business impacts that make it challenging to estimate all monetary costs and benefits from the outset. A core value of AI lies in business transformation: driving new business models, enabling innovative services, creating new revenue streams, and more.

With AI initiatives, you need to think like a venture capitalist. That means being willing to invest and take risks without being blocked by uncertainties. But you don't have to shoot in the dark—you'll need a framework to help prioritize AI investments. In the following sections, we'll describe how to:

* Leverage a horizon-based framework for evaluating initiatives.
* Map scenarios and use cases to the framework.
* Prioritize investments in phases.
* Define clear value drivers and KPIs.

## Leverage a horizon-based framework

At Microsoft, we use a "horizon-based" framework to evaluate and prioritize AI investments. This groups AI projects into three "horizons," from improving core business functions to creating brand new revenue streams. The risk and uncertainty of specific applications depends on a company's level of AI maturity, size, business objectives, and more.

### Horizon 1: Running (operate and optimize the core business)

:::row:::
:::column span="2":::
Not every AI application involves revolutionary changes. In fact, using AI to improve or automate existing processes is becoming essential to remaining competitive.

Horizon 1 (H1) represents AI initiatives that optimize core business functions. For example: perhaps you manufacture electronic components. While you might manually inspect quality for 100 parts per hour, an AI model with image recognition capabilities could inspect 1,000 parts per hour.

#### H1 examples:

* Optimizing transit routes automatically.
* Analyzing sentiment in customer feedback or social media.
* Scoring marketing leads.
* Forecasting demand or revenue.

The y-axis is labeled "Where to invest" and the x-axis is labeled as "Risk and uncertainty" and "Disruptive potential." The graph shows three groups of potential investments, all starting at the top of the y-axis where the x-axis starts. The first group is labeled as "H1" and its line is curved, almost circular, running from the top of the y-axis when x equals zero, to stopping one-third of the way along the x-axis. The area contained in this line is light blue. The next group is labeled "H2" and its line is curved, almost circular, running from the top of the y-axis when x equals zero, to stopping two-thirds of the way along the x-axis. The area under the line is a darker blue. The next horizon is labeled "H3" and its line is curved, in a circular fashion, running from the top of the y-axis when x equals zero, to stopping at the end of the x-axis. The area under this line is the darkest shade of blue.

### Horizon 2: Growing (improve market position)

Horizon 2 (H2) initiatives take advantage of emerging opportunities. These initiatives might create new services or new customer experiences. For example, a manufacturer of production machines might use IoT to collect operational data and AI to suggest optimal times for maintenance. This facilitates a brand-new customer experience and helps the manufacturer differentiate from competitors.

#### H2 examples:

* Predictive and preventative maintenance for machinery.
* Personalized recommendations or discounts.
* Supply chain, inventory, or price optimization.
* Detecting fraudulent behavior or security risks.

### Horizon 3: Transforming (change market position)

Horizon 3 (H3) involves disruptive and innovative new business models. These are revolutionary applications that might cross industry boundaries or even create new customer needs.

For example, a chemical manufacturer could sell "fertilizer-as-a-service"—which means they use AI models to predict changing environmental conditions and distribute fertilizer to farmers proactively. Ultimately, the company is selling a personalized service rather than a single product, creating new revenue streams and opportunities.

#### H3 examples:

* Predicting which patients are at risk of cardiac arrest leveraging EHR patient data.
* Building an interactive assistant that enables employees to find expertise and share ideas.
* Mapping chemical and flavor compounds of beverages to create new products faster.

## Map scenarios and use cases to the framework

:::row:::
:::column span="2":::
Using this framework, you can then map AI scenarios into quadrants. The "tactical" spectrum represents initiatives that are confined to a single team or use case. The "strategic" side represents larger business initiatives that might impact the entire organization.

To use a retail example, you might place location-based targeted advertising in the upper left quadrant. It's an initiative that digitizes and optimizes an existing business model without requiring systemic changes.

Scenarios that fall below the middle line help the organization survive more than thrive. They might address competitive and disruptive threats, improve operations, or empower employees in the organization. Scenarios above the middle line help companies create new value propositions, revenue streams, or business models.
:::column-end:::

:::image type="complex" source="../media/implement-ai-organization-4.png" alt-text="Illustration of transformational framework.":::
The left side of the x-axis is labeled "Tactical" and the right is labeled "Strategic." A double-sided arrow sits on the x-axis, pointing to both ends. The bottom of the y-axis is labeled "Existing business models" and the right side is labeled "New business models." A double-sided arrow runs along the y-axis and points to both ends. Within the graph are four quadrants. The bottom left quadrant is a grey box labeled "H1." The box contains an icon of a wrench and a gear. The bottom right quadrant is a blue box labeled "H2," containing the icon of a drone. The top left quadrant is a blue box labeled "H2," containing the icon of augmented reality glasses. The top right is a dark blue box labeled "H3," containing the icon of a robotic arm. A grey arrow extends from the bottom left H1 box to the top right H3 box, indicating that initiatives start operational and move to transformational.

As you map initiatives, it's helpful to involve the CFO office and other stakeholders to ensure you've made the right assumptions around the opportunity valuation.

## Prioritize investments and organize phases

We recommend prioritizing initiatives in phases: start with foundational initiatives in the bottom left and move towards transformational initiatives in the top right.

:::row:::
:::column span="2":::
We recommend this approach because it's helpful to grow capabilities and get buy-in before you move to more complex projects. You'll need to form technical teams that can prepare data properly and familiarize themselves with AI models. Starting with foundational initiatives also helps establish trust across the business and manage expectations related to AI initiatives. The success and value you're able to demonstrate in early initiatives pave the way for the more transformational projects.

Another reason to start at the bottom left is that the technology used to support H1 initiatives is typically more accessible than advanced use cases. There are countless out-of-the-box and pre-trained AI models you can leverage for common use cases. These applications cost less and their impact on the business is easier to estimate. As you build maturity with these accessible models, you can experiment with more complex AI initiatives and hone your objectives.

The left side of the x-axis is labeled "Tactical" and the right is labeled "Strategic." A double-sided arrow sits on the x-axis, pointing to both ends. The bottom of the y-axis is labeled "Existing business models" and the top side is labeled "New business models." A double-sided arrow runs along the y-axis and points to both ends. Within the graph are four quadrants. The bottom left quadrant is labeled "Incremental." The bottom right quadrant is labeled "Evolutionary." The top left quadrant is labeled "Experimental." The top right quadrant is labeled "Aspirational." There are three slightly curved rectangular shapes over the quadrants representing each horizon, H1, H2, and H3. H1 is in bottom left quadrant. H2 is in the middle of the graph, spanning the Experimental, Aspirational, and Evolutionary quadrants. The H3 shape sits in the Aspirational quadrant. Each shape has one grey circle on them, representing AI initiatives. Circle "A" is on H1, and it connects with grey arrows to circle "B" on the H2 shape. That grey circle connects with a grey arrow to circle "C." The arrows show how the projects and horizons flow from left to right.

H2 and H3 initiatives require more sophisticated data science capabilities, which may result in unintended or unexpected outcomes. These initiatives often require businesses to work with partners to create a custom model that can't be bought off the shelf. These solutions require the most resources, time, and risk, but they offer the greatest reward. Achieving a lasting competitive advantage requires solutions that can't be easily duplicated by others.

## Define clear value drivers and KPIs for your AI investments

Once you've chosen AI initiatives, it's important to identify value drivers and KPIs for each project. The framework below provides a useful way to think about any investment—including AI initiatives.

| Quality measures  | Quality                                 | The degree to which products or services meet customer or business expectations.                                                                                                                     | Improve product quality with automated inspection processes.                              |
|                   | Cycle times                             | The time it takes to complete a process.                                                                                                                                                             | Accelerate product inspections with image recognition.                                    |
|                   | Satisfaction (customer and/or employee) | How happy customers are with a company's products or services (which contributes to market share, competitive differentiation, and more).                                                            | Improve customer engagement with personalized discounts and product bundles.              |

As you invest in initiatives, it's important to develop market and financial models to help balance potential risk and return. Consider factors such as the total addressable market (TAM), net present value (NPV), and internal rate of return (IRR). Work with the CFO office and other key stakeholders to ensure the financial models make sense within the context of the business. This is helpful to get their buy-in and ensure support throughout the process as well.

Moving forward, we advise putting systemic processes in place to manage and evaluate value throughout the project lifecycle. We recommend taking an agile approach that happens in stages—after you invest in an initiative, evaluate the initial results. Then you can determine whether to continue, adjust your approach, or take another path. Do this at major milestones throughout the project.

## Conclusion

AI is already transforming industries, and the potential value it can generate will only continue to grow. We need a new, creative way to evaluate transformative AI initiatives. Equipped with the right framework, you'll have a strong foundation for innovation.

Next, let’s take a look at the AI-related roles and responsibilities that should be established in every AI organization.
