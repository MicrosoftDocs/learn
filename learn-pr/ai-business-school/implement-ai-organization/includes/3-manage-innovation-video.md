As you heard, it’s important for organizations to create a multi-disciplinary innovation group that focuses on learning rather than revenue. Organization should keep key stakeholders informed throughout the innovation process. Finally, organizations should find customers who are willing to explore new solutions with them.

Rimes Mortimer points out that business leaders play a critical role in driving innovation. “You have to be inspirational and you have to set a vision that people can buy into and believe can be achieved,” Rimes Mortimer says. Business leaders must commit to putting the time and resources into promoting innovation across their business.

Rimes Mortimer also discusses the book *The Innovator’s Dilemma* by Clayton Christensen. In the book, Clayton Christensen highlights that businesses often fail because they don’t innovate beyond their core competencies. Addressing this concern means leaders must invest in disruptive tech even when they don’t see immediate return on investment.
