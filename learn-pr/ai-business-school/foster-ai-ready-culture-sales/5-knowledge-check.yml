    - content: "Increase the AI maturity level of the sales organization."
      isCorrect: false

      explanation: "Correct. Quote: “We implemented an AI-based guided selling application, the Daily Recommender, which provides sellers with data-driven insights and actionable product recommendations to help attain quota, resulting in higher conversion rates and increased seller productivity.”"
    - content: "Designated sellers from each region to form an AI task force."
