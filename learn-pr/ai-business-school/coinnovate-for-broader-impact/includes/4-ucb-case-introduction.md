## Abstract 

UCB is a Belgium-based biopharmaceutical company specializing in immunology and neurology. With more than 7,600 people across the globe, UCB’s vision is inspired by patients and driven by science. UCB relies on innovation as a core part of their company. Their mission is to support the delivery of increased patient value and develop new solutions to transform the lives of people living with severe diseases. This case study describes how UCB innovated with external partners using technology like AI to research the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Their goal is to expand scientific understanding around the disease to inform corresponding drug development. By supporting cross-organizational and external collaboration with other individual contributors, chemical vendors, and technology companies, UCB helped support the resilience of their business and the resilience of society fighting against a global pandemic.

## Challenge

The rapid spread, global severity, and lack of knowledge around a virus now known as COVID-19 gained the attention and focus of researchers and pharmaceutical companies worldwide in the spring of 2020. The problem faced by UCB and pharmaceutical companies alike was the same: developing, testing, and delivering new drugs on average takes more than a decade from the time of development to regulatory approval.<sup>6</sup> Drastically accelerating this timeline became an immediate need in preventing the spread of COVID-19.

To help with this, UCB wanted to use AI to identify potential molecules that prevent replication in the COVID-19 virus. However, UCB knew that to test such a high volume of data required an unprecedented amount of processing power to achieve a shorter timeline. For that reason, UCB needed to turn to external partners for help. Additionally, to truly be a part of a collective response to the pandemic, UCB wanted to ensure any findings from their molecule tests could be readily available and accessible to the public—rather than isolated within their company.

## Questions for consideration

* What are some ways UCB could have tried accelerating the drug development process?
* Why might UCB choose to pursue external partnerships rather than innovating within their own firm? What are the benefits of external coinnovation?
* How might UCB make their findings available to the public? What are some ways they could make this information known?

Next, let’s watch how UCB approached solving these challenges by coinnovating with Microsoft and how they continue maximizing this partnership throughout and beyond COVID-19.
