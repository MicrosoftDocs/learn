Throughout this module, we’ve discussed how important it’s to coinnovate beyond your organization to accelerate solutions and remain competitive long term. We’ve also uncovered that innovation doesn’t exist in a vacuum — especially with technology companies. New technologies bring new challenges for organizations of all sizes. These challenges have a huge impact on communities and when specific issues arise, specialized partnerships are necessary. That’s why external partnerships and collaboration play a key role in understanding how innovation efforts impact people and the community beyond your organization — especially with groups who have more knowledge of the issue at hand. By creating this culture and understanding the different relationships, your organization will thrive despite disruptions — making you more resilient.

Now that you've reviewed the module, you should be able to:

* Describe the benefits of collaborating with external partners.
* Understand the relationship between ESG scores and innovation.
* Learn how coinnovating with external partners can help make it easier to adopt new technology quicker.
