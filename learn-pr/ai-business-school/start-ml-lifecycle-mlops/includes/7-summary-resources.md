MLOps practices facilitate better business results, enable faster time to market, and accelerate experimentation. These practices also increase collaboration and alignment across teams and help assure model quality and auditability—ultimately accelerating the ML lifecycle.

Now that you have reviewed this module, you should be able to:

* Identify the different steps of the ML lifecycle.
* Describe how to create and manage machine learning models using MLOps processes.
* Articulate processes to monitor models and respond to incidents.
