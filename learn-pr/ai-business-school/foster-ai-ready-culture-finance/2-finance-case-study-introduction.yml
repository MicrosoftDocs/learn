  description: Microsoft’s finance organization was looking for ways to intelligently automate processes and empower employees to deliver more forward-looking insights and forecasts. We embedded AI into key finance operations processes to improve forecast accuracy, reduce strain on employees, and better predict areas of risk. These applications have saved our finance team hundreds of hours per month, while enabling better business decision-making and risk mitigation. In this unit you will learn about how we incorporated AI into our finance processes and consider how AI could transform your own finance organization.
