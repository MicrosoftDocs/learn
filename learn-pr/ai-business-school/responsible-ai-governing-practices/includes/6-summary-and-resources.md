Through this module, we have walked through some of the steps organizations can take to establish their own responsible AI governance model. However, we recognize that we do not have all the answers and every individual, company, and region will have their own beliefs and standards that should be reflected in their AI governance model.

Now that you have reviewed this module, you should be able to:

* Determine the elements of an AI governance system.
* Choose an AI governance model that fits your organization’s needs.

## Actions your organization can take

To help you consider how to leverage governance and external engagements in your own organization, we developed the recommendations below.

### Establishing an AI governance system

* **Choose a governance structure** that best fits your organization’s AI maturity, unique characteristics, culture, and business objectives
* **Encourage your governance system to develop a set of guiding ethical principles** based on your organization’s foundational values.
* **Outline the specific role of your governance system** within your organization. Consider having them develop and implement policies, standards, and best practices, build a culture of integrity, provide advice, educate employees, help mitigate risks associated with AI systems, and respond to violations in a timely and consistent manner.
* **Provide your governance system with the financial and human resources they need** to affect real change within your organization.
* **Adapt your governance system(s)** as your AI maturity and business objectives change and industry best practices improve.

### Governing AI engagement

* **Create a handbook or manual to govern the use of AI in your organization** to help ensure your employees follow the policies your governance system establishes.
* **Train employees** on the policies, standards, and best practices that your governance system establishes.

### Third-party AI systems

* **Research the third party’s stance on responsible design** before purchasing out-of-the-box AI solutions to ensure they were designed in a manner consistent with your principles, policies, and standards.
* **Include your principles in your request for proposal**, so the solution can be design with your principles in mind.
* **Create guidelines** on how to safely operate and monitor the system and train your employees on these guidelines before deploying the system.
* **Rigorously test** the system to ensure it operates as intended and in a manner consistent with your principles, policies, and standards.

### First party AI systems

* **Consider having your governance system review or provide advice before the release of any new AI system**, especially for sensitive use cases.
* **Create processes for employees to analyze an AI system’s** purpose, technical capabilities, reliability, and use case prior to its release.
* **Provide clear guidelines to ensure your ethical principles are reflected in an AI system** if you are developing AI systems in-house. Support your developers by using industry-established guidelines or developing your own, especially for AI systems that raise complex ethical or human rights considerations.
* **Consider integrating internal guidelines into project management processes**, such as a checklist aligned to the phases of a data science project.
* **Leverage tools and resources** to make it easier for developers to spot and design against potentially harmful issues like biases, safety and privacy gaps, and exclusionary practices.

### Participating in external engagements

* **Engage in public and private partnerships to advance responsible use of AI.** Collaboration between enterprises, public organizations, government, and non-profits is crucial as we address the concern and challenges of AI, while maximizing its potential to deliver broad benefits.
* **Join coalitions with organizations to foster a technologically savvy workforce** and help ensure workers are prepared for the changing economy.
* **Share your AI perspective with the greater community, such as governments, businesses, and standards organizations**, to help guide responsible policies and legislation.
* **Apply your AI expertise and technologies to benefit your community** and improve the lives of people around the world.
