  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "A company uses a decentralized organizational model when it comes to AI implementation. What might be a disadvantage of their decentralized model when compared to a centralized model?"
    choices:
    - content: "They can’t utilize the cross sharing of knowledge."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The siloed nature of a decentralized model limits the sharing of knowledge throughout the organization."
    - content: "Their ability to rapidly innovate is extremely inhibited."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Decentralized models are often nimble and enable rapid innovation."
    - content: "They lack the ability to create standards at the grassroots level."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Creating standards at the grassroots level is in fact a strength of the decentralized model."
    - content: "The nature of decentralization can constrain innovation."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. It is the centralized model that can constrain innovation due to a top-down approach."
  - content: "Why is it important to clearly define an AI framework when adopting a responsible AI approach?"
    choices:
    - content: "A clearly defined AI framework provides a reference point for AI systems, helping them adjust their own behavior to remain in compliance and eliminate bias."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. An AI framework provides a reference point for the humans overseeing AI systems, enabling them to adjust the AI’s behavior back into compliance."
    - content: "Having a clearly defined AI framework doesn’t matter when adopting a responsible AI approach because AI systems won’t always be compliant with the framework."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A clearly defined framework will allow organizations to consistently evaluate their AI systems and adjust their behavior to achieve compliance and eliminate bias."
    - content: "A clearly defined AI framework establishes consistent guidelines across the organization, building trust in AI systems."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While a clearly defined framework does establish consistent guidelines across the organization, it does not automatically build trust in AI systems; only careful oversight and continual assessment can do this."
    - content: "A clearly defined AI framework establishes consistent guidelines across the organization to ensure all teams are evaluating AI systems consistently and compliance is maintained."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. A clearly defined framework ensures all teams are referencing the same policy documentation while evaluating AI systems for compliance."
  - content: "You want to implement a governance approach to AI within your organization that will incorporate a diverse array of outside experts and senior leaders from within the company. What will be part of your governance approach?"
    choices:
    - content: "First-party AI system."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A first-party AI systems is not a governance approach."
    - content: "Third-party AI system."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A third-party AI system is not a governance approach."
    - content: "Ethics committee."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. An ethics committee is made up of people within and outside of the organization."
    - content: "Ethics office."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. An ethics office only consists of members within the organization."
  - content: "What role do humans play in the creation and use of AI?"
    choices:
    - content: "Humans play a role in creating the rules and policies that govern AI."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Humans do create the rules and policies for AI systems, but they are involved across the entire AI lifecycle."
    - content: "Humans play a role in the entire lifecycle of an AI model, from design and development to continuous evaluation and improvement."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Humans must decide how the AI model will be used and by whom, what training data to leverage, how that data is prepared, and which algorithms are selected. Humans must also decide on performance metrics for the AI system and monitor its performance over time."
    - content: "Humans play a role in assessing AI performance and should run occasional quality assurance tests."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Humans should be continually overseeing AI systems to detect abnormal behavior, not running occasional quality assurance tests.     More broadly, humans are involved across the entire AI lifecycle."
    - content: "AI systems don’t require humans, they’re designed to operate without human involvement."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Humans are involved across the entire AI lifecycle."
