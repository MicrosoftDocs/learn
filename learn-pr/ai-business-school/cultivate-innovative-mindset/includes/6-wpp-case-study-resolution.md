## Approach 

To help their clients reach the public in a more creative and effective way while continuously brainstorming new ways to maintain their competitive advantage in the market, WPP knew they needed to involve their biggest asset—their employees. While marketing and technology have been intertwined for decades, WPP was looking to unlock possibilities that didn’t exist before by implementing the ideas across roles and domains. To support international collaboration using AI across the organization, WPP implemented an intentional approach with new processes, resources, and education for its people.  

To expand employee creativity, WPP focused on building new channels for communication and collaboration across their organization to accelerate knowledge sharing. They established the WPP Open Data & AI Community where over 2,000 active members can share tips and ask for help. The community hosts events, webinars, and training on topics ranging from data fundamentals to AI ethics. WPP also has a goal to train 5,000 data scientists in the organization through its AI Academy.

WPP furthermore prioritized the partnership between data scientists and creative professionals to merge creativity with data literacy. To help their employees speak to and work with new technologies, part of their innovation strategy was to ensure everyone across the organization fully understood how AI applications work and the value they bring to the company–including topics like machine learning, reinforcement learning, and digital assistant. That’s why they aim to educate at least 50,000 colleagues around how AI can empower their role and be applied to various projects. Additionally, WPP wanted to enable its employees to articulate the value of AI at their firm and how that translates to added value to their clients. WPP has partnered with various organizations including Microsoft’s AI Business School, Coursera, Territory Studios, Synthesia, and the Oxford Saïd Business School to help deliver this education.

Besides providing data scientists and marketing experts with the resources and community they needed to succeed, WPP also decided to spread AI expertise across WPP agencies to avoid centralizing innovation. Their approach was to share information and resources openly and broadly across its agencies with the WPP Open platform. Innovative products and solutions developed by a WPP agency essentially became available to all agencies after going through a centralized vetting process. Teams working on new technology projects also documented success stories to instruct and inspire others. This operating model has dual benefits: WPP experts collaborated and supported agencies to deliver innovative results, and they contributed back to WPP so that the entire company learned from their experience.

“We’re constantly challenging ourselves to make sure we add to what the agencies are already doing,” says Di Mayze, Global Head of Data & AI at WPP. “To share agency work across the company so we build on each other’s success, and we don’t reinvent the wheel all the time.”

## Results

WPP is delivering creativity that’s powered by technology, helping employees globally experiment with and use new technologies to better predict and understand customer behavior and preferences and develop more engaging communications for the brands they work with. WPP’s openness to change and the ability to see possibilities has been essential to their success. To reap the benefits of solutions such as AI, WPP made the necessary investments and adopted a “fail fast” philosophy. This philosophy encouraged learning and iteration early in the innovation process, so they didn’t get stuck.

The results of this collaboration process are plentiful. WPP created the WPP Data Catalog, containing highly diverse datasets easily available to everyone and already used by more than 1,000 people throughout all 80 agencies.

Here are a few examples of these AI projects that unfolded because of the enhanced collaboration and AI education:

* Using AI to predict COVID-19 vaccination demand by combining retailers’ first-party data with WPP’s third-party data and identity resolution services. Helping give greater visibility into which customers have a high likelihood of wanting a vaccine and identifying areas with high demand.
* WPP’s B2B Content Intelligence tool uses natural language processing to analyze text and audience behavior, delivering insights that inspire more targeted, accelerated creative.
* WPP supports Momentum, a solution that helps marketers and brands deal with the continued fragmentation of data across consumer channels. This enabled brands to increase consumer identification between 30 and 80 percent.
* WPP is developing an AI-based tool that seeks to identify discriminatory language in terms of age, gender, and other factors to address bias in content and design.

“Distributed innovation means that everyone can innovate. Everyone is challenged to use their ingenuity to solve business problems. This is an empowering driver of change within WPP.” says Stephan Pretorius, Global Chief Technology Officer at WPP.  

The openness to change and adapt, willingness to make investments in time and budget, and embracing human-centric approach that sees failure as an opportunity to learn has accelerated the effectiveness of these AI projects and collaboration at large.  

Companies like Mondelēz International and UCB are also empowering cross-organizational collaboration to support innovation. Check out the [Best of Business AI](https://businessai.microsoft.com/) to learn more about their success.

## Key lessons

### Collaboration extends beyond sharing ideas  

To establish a culture of collaboration, organizations should approach innovation as a platform—providing the data, resources, and technology needed to collaborate and expand employee creativity. To do this, WPP implemented diverse datasets easily accessible to everyone. This changed the way people interacted with one another throughout all 80 agencies.  

### Collaboration fosters innovation  

By enabling cross-org collaboration and providing the right foundation to use AI, WPP was able to innovate and deliver new solutions that they previously wouldn’t have been able to use. For example, they are using AI to deliver competitive solutions targeted to customers’ needs, identifying discriminatory language to address bias, and uncovering demand for COVID-19 vaccinations.
