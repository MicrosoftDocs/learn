  title: Understand how Prosci's ADKAR framework can help you lead organizational change
  description: Fostering an AI-ready culture requires a fundamental transformation in how you do things, how employees relate to each other, what skills they have, and what processes and principles guide your behaviors. All these changes require altering behaviors, which in turn requires letting go of old habits and adopting new ones. This is, without a doubt, one of the hardest things to do. A cultural transformation like this is driven largely by leaders and requires an approach that generates energy and inspires employees. In the age of AI, leadership needs to be nimble and responsive in managing change.
