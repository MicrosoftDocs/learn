    choices:
    - content: "Machine Learning"
      isCorrect: true

    - content: "Language Learning"
      isCorrect: false

    - content: "Vision Capabilities"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Vision capabilities look at pictures, or even handwritten forms, and interpret or convert what is seen in the picture to text."
