Dr. Zimmerman describes how leveraging AI tools in the classroom can help better prepare students to be effective in their lives and careers. To provide students with the best foundation possible, educators shouldn’t rely on archaic teaching models based on rote memorization, but should instead give students tools to find creative solutions for the problems of the future. By using a balance of technology and humanity, Dr. Zimmerman believes we can push students to solve problems that aren’t solvable by machines and impassion them to make a difference in the world.
