    - content: "AI can save educators time, enabling shorter work-days and compressed courses."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Although AI can automate routine tasks for educators and improve efficiency, the goal of AI should be to enable better outcomes for students."
    - content: "AI will soon replace educators, saving institutions thousands if implemented correctly."
      isCorrect: false

    - content: "Human educators are always more biased than AI, so AI will make classrooms fairer."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. AI can become biased if given biased training data, so the claim that AI will always be more fair than a human is false."
  - content: "How does utilizing AI tools in the classroom better prepare students for their futures?"
    choices:
    - content: "AI tools help students memorize answers more efficiently, ensuring they do better on tests."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Memorizing content and relaying it on tests does not teach students to creatively solve the complex problems they will face in the future."
    - content: "AI tools will soon replace educators because they are faster and more efficient."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While teachers may use AI tools to enhance the learning experience at scale, AI will never replace educators."
    - content: "AI will soon be a part of every job, so getting students accustomed to working with it in the classroom will prepare them for their career."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While it’s true that exposing students to AI early will prepare them for a technology-driven future, simply being exposed to it won’t teach them problem solving skills."
    - content: "AI tools help students take control of their own education, ask challenging questions, and leverage technology to solve complex problems."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. This kind of learning prepares students for future success by laying a foundation for complex, creative problem solving."

    choices:
    - content: "Contributors must collaborate on AI integration because it will impact stakeholders across the entire organization and requires input from many different experts."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. To integrate AI effectively, people from every level and department should be viewed as stakeholders because everyone in the organization either contributes or benefits from the project."
    - content: "Contributors must collaborate on AI integration to spread the workload amongst themselves, saving time and resources."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. There is no guarantee that maintaining an equal workload will lead to good AI integration."
    - content: "Contributors must collaborate on AI integration to share knowledge amongst themselves."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While it is important for stakeholders to share knowledge, it is more important for people at every level of the institution to participate in AI implementation."
    - content: "Contributors must collaborate on AI integration to create a better experience for students."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While achieving better student outcomes should be the goal of an AI implementation, stakeholder collaboration does not directly impact this, strong AI integration does."
  - content: "Why is it beneficial to personalize the learning experience for students?"
