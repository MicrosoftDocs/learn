Having a support plan for Microsoft Endpoint Manager implementation can help you identify and resolve endpoint management-related issues more effectively. This, in turn, improves your users' overall endpoint management experience. Here are some questions to consider as you develop your support plan:

- Which teams will be responsible for providing endpoint management support?
- What process will be used to provide endpoint management support?
- How do you plan to provide endpoint management support training?
- What opportunities are you providing to involve the support team early in the endpoint management deployment process?

Let's review each area in more detail.

## Which teams are responsible for providing support?

Determine who will support end users. Organizations may have different tiers or levels (1-3) of support. For example, tier 1 and 2 may be part of the support team, and tier 3 include members of the MDM team responsible for the deployment of Endpoint Manager.

Tier 1 is normally the first level of support and typically the first tier to be contacted by the user for support requests. If tier 1 is unable to resolve the end user's issue, they escalate it to tier 2. Tier 2 escalates it to tier 3 if needed. In addition, Microsoft support may be considered as tier 4.

## What is the support process?

Create a help desk workflow, and constantly communicate support issues, trends, and other important information to all tiers in your support team. For example, hold daily or weekly Teams meetings so all tiers are aware of trends, patterns, and can get help. Design a process of how your organization will implement your IT support or helpdesk workflows. Consider having multiple tiers of support based on the complexity of the issues and the investigation that is required.

## How you plan to provide endpoint management support training?

It's important to provide Endpoint Manager technical training for your IT support or helpdesk staff so that the training is at an appropriate level and applies to the specific support tier and their responsibilities. You could have the Endpoint Manager MDM team conduct this training to the support leads (training the trainer), then have the leads provide this training to their support team members. This training can typically be provided in 2-3 hours, and it includes lecture and labs.

An example of an Endpoint Manager support training agenda is provided below.

- Endpoint Manager support plan review
- Endpoint Manager overview
- Troubleshooting common issues
- Tools and resources
- Q & A

The [Microsoft Endpoint Manager documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/mem?azure-portal=true) provides overviews, detailed feature descriptions, and troubleshooting information. In addition, both Intune and Configuration Manager documentation contain links to community-based resource for questions and topics not covered in the documentation.

## What opportunities are there to involve the support team earlier?

Involving your IT support/helpdesk staff in early stages of Microsoft Endpoint Management deployment planning and pilot efforts can improve your endpoint management deployment and end-user adoption. Early involvement provides your support staff with exposure to Endpoint Manager and valuable experience from the beginning. This helps prepare your IT support/helpdesk staff for supporting the organization's full production rollout.
