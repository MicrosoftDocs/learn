A successful endpoint management deployment or migration starts with having a good plan. This module helps you consider and design your endpoint management plan. When you're complete, you'll have a better understanding of your endpoint management objectives, your device inventory considerations, the licensing involved, the policies and infrastructure needed, the rollout plan to consider, and more.

The Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center helps keep your organization's cloud and on-premises devices, apps, and data secure. By using Endpoint Manager, you gain the capabilities and benefits of Microsoft Intune, Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager, Desktop Analytics, and Windows Autopilot, as well as several related technologies.
