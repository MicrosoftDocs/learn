Windows Autopilot simplifies enrolling devices in Intune. You provide the enrollment details up front before the end user receives a new computer. The Windows Autopilot process runs immediately after powering on a new computer for the first time, helping employees configure new devices to be business-ready with just a few clicks. You can also use Windows Autopilot to reset, repurpose, and recover devices. Leveraging cloud-based services, you can automatically join devices to Azure AD, auto-enroll devices into MDM services such as Microsoft Intune, restrict rights on the computer, auto-assign devices to configuration groups, and customize the Out-of-box-experience (OOBE) content to be specific for your organization.

By using a collection of cloud-based technologies, Windows Autopilot:

- Reduces the time IT spends on deploying, managing, and retiring devices.
- Reduces the infrastructure required to maintain the devices.
- Maximizes ease of use for all types of end users.

From the user's perspective, it only takes a few simple operations to make their device ready to use. The only interaction required from the end user is to connect to a network and to verify their credentials. Everything beyond that is automated.
