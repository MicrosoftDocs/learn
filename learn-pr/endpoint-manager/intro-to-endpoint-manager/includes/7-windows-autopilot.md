Windows Autopilot simplifies enrolling devices in Intune by letting you provide the enrollment details before an end user gets a new computer. The Windows Autopilot process runs immediately after the new computer powers on for the first time, and helps the user configure their device in a few steps.

The only interaction required from the end user is to connect to a network and verify their credentials. Everything beyond that is automated. From the user's perspective, it only takes a few simple operations to make their device business-ready.

You can configure Windows Autopilot to do the following tasks by using cloud-based services:

- Automatically join devices to Microsoft Entra ID.
- Autoenroll devices into mobile device management (MDM) services such as Microsoft Intune.
- Restrict rights on the device.
- Autoassign devices to configuration groups.
- Present customized out-of-box-experience (OOBE) content for your organization.
- Reset, repurpose, and recover devices.

By using cloud-based technologies, Windows Autopilot:

- Reduces IT time deploying, managing, and retiring devices.
- Reduces the infrastructure required to maintain devices.
- Maximizes end user ease of use.
