Microsoft Intune provides cloud-based mobile device management (MDM), cloud-based mobile application management (MAM), and cloud-based computer management for your organization. Microsoft Intune helps you protect your organization by controlling features and settings on Android, Android Enterprise, iOS/iPadOS, macOS, and Windows 10/11 devices.

Microsoft Intune integrates closely with:

- Microsoft Entra ID for identity and access control.
- Microsoft Purview Information Protection.
- Microsoft Defender advanced threat protection products.

When you use Microsoft Intune with Microsoft 365, you can help your workforce be productive on all their devices while protecting your organization's information. If you have on-premises infrastructure such as Exchange or an Active Directory, you can use Intune connectors to help you connect to external services. Intune is included in Microsoft's [Security suite](https://www.microsoft.com/security).
