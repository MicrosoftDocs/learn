Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager is a computer management solution. You can use Configuration Manager to manage desktops, servers, and laptops that are on your network or the internet. You can attach your Configuration Manager deployment to the Microsoft 365 cloud to provide integration with Intune, Microsoft Entra ID, Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, and other cloud services.

You can use Configuration Manager to:

- Deploy apps, software updates, and operating systems.
- Configure sites and clients.
- Run and monitor management tasks.

Configuration Manager supports Windows and macOS. The devices you manage with Configuration Manager can run in virtual environments, such as Hyper-V on Windows servers and virtual machines (VMs) in Azure. If you run a server as an Azure-based VM, you can install the Configuration Manager client on that server.
