Endpoint analytics aims to improve user productivity and reduce IT support costs by providing insights into how your organization is working and the quality of the experience you're delivering to your end users. Endpoint analytics can help identify configuration or hardware issues that might be slowing down devices, provide recommended actions to remediate them, and proactively make changes without disrupting end users or generating a help desk ticket.

Endpoint analytics is also a part of the [Microsoft Productivity Score](/microsoft-365/admin/productivity/productivity-score?azure-portal=true). The Productivity Score provides productivity data, insights, and recommendations for your end users' experience and your organization's overall technology experience.
