- Help protect the data that the people at your organization access.
- Help safeguard the devices and apps that access organizational resources.
- Ensure your organization uses proper credentials to access and share company data.
- Confirm that security rules are in place based on your organization's requirements.
- Confirm that every organization member's devices are correctly configured and protected.
