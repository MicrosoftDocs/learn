Microsoft Intune allows you to manage and secure your organization's cloud and on-premises devices, apps, and data. As part of this management, you can use Intune to protect device data, manage assignments, ensure proper device access, implement device-security rules, and resolve device-compliance issues.

In this module, you learned about device management using Microsoft Intune. Here are some of the things you covered:

- Provisioning is a process when your organization issues new or repurposed devices to individuals in your organization.
- There are several methods to enroll your workforce's devices. Each method depends on device ownership (personal or corporate), device type or platform (iOS/iPadOS, Windows, Android, macOS), and device management requirements (resets, affinity, locking).
- When you configure devices in your organization, you can apply settings and features to be enabled or disabled.
- Protecting devices from unauthorized access is one of the most important tasks that you perform.
- There are many ways you can retire a device. Including, resetting the device, removing it from management, and wiping the corporate data on it.
