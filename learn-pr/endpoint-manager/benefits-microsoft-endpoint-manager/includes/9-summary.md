Microsoft Intune provides the services and tools you need in one location to manage your organization's endpoints. 

Modern IT provides cloud intelligence at the core, and Microsoft Intune provides this modern management. Intune doesn't require you to make an either/or decision between on-premises and cloud management. You can do both and modernize at your own pace to manage risk in a smart way.

- Intelligent and unified endpoint security.
- Flexible and unified endpoint management.
- Data protection without device enrollment.
- Increased end-user productivity.
