Mobile Application Management (MAM) allows you to manage and protect your organization's data within an application. With **MAM without enrollment** (MAM-WE), a work- or school-related app that contains sensitive data can be managed on almost any device, including personal devices in **bring-your-own-device** (BYOD) scenarios. Intune MAM can manage many productivity apps, such as the Microsoft Office apps. 

Intune MAM supports two configurations:

- **Intune MDM + MAM**: IT administrators can only manage apps using MAM and app-protection policies on devices that are enrolled with Intune mobile device management (MDM).
- **MAM without device enrollment**: MAM without device enrollment (MAM-WE) allows IT administrators to manage apps using MAM and app protection policies on devices not enrolled with Intune MDM. This means Intune can manage apps on devices enrolled with third-party Enterprise Mobility Management (EMM) providers, or not enrolled with an MDM at all.
