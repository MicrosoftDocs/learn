Microsoft Intune, which is a part of Microsoft Endpoint Manager, provides the cloud infrastructure, the cloud-based mobile device management (MDM), the cloud-based mobile application management (MAM), and the cloud-based PC management for your organization. It lets you protect your organization by controlling features and settings on Android, Android Enterprise, iOS/iPadOS, macOS, and Windows 10/11 devices. Intune is included in Microsoft's [Enterprise Mobility + Security (EMS) suite](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/enterprise-mobility-security?azure-portal=true).

Intune integrates closely with Microsoft Entra ID for identity and access control. It integrates with Azure Information Protection to help protect your organization's data. If you have on-premises infrastructure, such as Exchange or an Active Directory, you can use Intune connectors to help you connect to external services.
