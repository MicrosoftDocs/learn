Microsoft Intune uses groups to assign policies such as Conditional Access policies and endpoint security policies. These policies make up the rules that you and your organization use to ensure proper access and security. You can use a Conditional Access policy to control access to your organization's resources, such as email, files, and data. Conditional Access makes sure that only trusted users can access organizational resources on trusted devices using trusted apps. You can assign endpoint-security policies to help provide security for your organization's devices and mitigate risk.

Intune uses Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) groups to manage devices and users. You can set up groups to suit your organizational needs. Create groups to organize users or devices by geographic location, department, or hardware characteristics. If your organization is large, you can use groups to manage tasks at scale. When you assign policies to users and devices, you use groups.

Suppose that you're the administrator of a company with several thousand employees. Your company must only allow employees with trusted credentials to access company information internally and externally. You must implement the rules that are enforced when employees attempt to access corporate data.  

Here, you'll learn how you can use Microsoft Intune and Conditional Access to protect your organization's data.
