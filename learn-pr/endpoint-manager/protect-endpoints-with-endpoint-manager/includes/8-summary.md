- The settings that you assign are contained in policies that you create.
- You assign the policies to groups that you define.
- You can create and apply device policies as part of your efforts to protect endpoints.
- Intune mobile application management (MAM) capabilities are supported whether you choose to enroll the device or not.
- You can prevent data leaks and prevent unauthorized access by using Intune.
- Endpoint management includes cloud endpoints, on-premises endpoints, cloud + on-premises endpoints, and co-management endpoints.
- Platforms are the types of devices and the operating systems that are supported. Intune supports various Apple, Google, and Microsoft platforms.
