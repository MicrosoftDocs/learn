You can use Microsoft Intune to manage the apps that your company's workforce uses on their devices. This functionality is called mobile application management (MAM). MAM in Intune is designed to protect organization data at the application level, including custom apps and store apps. App management can be used on organization-owned devices and personal devices. When it's used with personal devices, only organization-related access and data are managed.

In this module, you've learned about the possible migration path to Microsoft Intune. Here are some of the things you covered.

- The app lifecycle follows the following stages: add, assign, configure, protect, and retire.
- App configuration policies that can help you eliminate app setup problems.
- App protection policies that help you secure access on personal devices by restricting actions users can take with organizational data.
- You can create and deploy protection policies on devices that are either enrolled in Intune, enrolled in another mobile device management (MDM) service, or not enrolled in any MDM service.
- You can use specially adapted iOS or Android apps that support a layer of protection. These apps are called protected apps and are available as Microsoft apps and partner apps. Partner app providers use the Intune App Software Development Kit (SDK) or the App Wrapping Tool to specifically hook their apps into Intune.
- The data protection framework is organized into three distinct configuration levels that you can follow to ensure your apps are protected when using Intune.
