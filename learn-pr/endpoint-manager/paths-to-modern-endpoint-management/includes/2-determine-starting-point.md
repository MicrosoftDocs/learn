When you have decided to migrate your organization to Microsoft Endpoint Manager, you must determine where to start. You must confirm the endpoint management solution you and your organization currently use. Then, determine the direction and solution that will make the most sense for you and your organization.

When determining your organization's future Enterprise Mobility Management (EMM) direction, consider the following questions:
- Is your organization's devices, apps, and data currently managed in the cloud, on-premises, a combination of both cloud and on-premises, or not managed at all?
- Do you need to have your organization's devices, apps, and data managed in the cloud, on-premises, or a combination of both cloud and on-premises?

This module describes four basic paths you should consider when migrating from your existing endpoint management state to Microsoft Endpoint Manager. These paths describe the possible starting points of your organization's endpoint management solution or state. Each path provides the basic direction you should consider, as well as the migration benefits and additional value that your organization will gain by migrating to Microsoft Endpoint Manager. The basic paths are the following:

- Limited or no existing endpoint management tools 
- Existing third-party mobile device management provider 
- Existing on-premises endpoint management implementation
- Existing on-premises group policy
