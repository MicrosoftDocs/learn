  title: Capture patterns with recurrent neural networks
  description: While traditional fully-connected networks do not allow us to capture word order, RNN is a mechanism that can capture patterns in sequences. We show how to use RNN for text classification, and discuss different RNN architectures, such as LSTM and GRU.
