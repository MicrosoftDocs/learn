  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
    - content: "What is the sample rate?"
      choices:
        - content: "Frequency mapped to time."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect, frequency mapped to time is a Spectrogram."
        - content: "The audio channels."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Although audio channels can be used in sampling, this is not what sample rate is"
        - content: "Sampling analog sound at consistent intervals of time to create a digital sound representation."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct!"
    - content: "What is the waveform?"
      choices:
        - content: "Frequency mapped to time."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect, frequency mapped to time is a Spectrogram."
        - content: "Sample rate and frequency visualized."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct! We can visualize our data using a waveform to map sample rate and frequency"
        - content: "The audio channels."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect."
