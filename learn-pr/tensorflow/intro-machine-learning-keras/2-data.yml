  questions:
  - content: "Why do we encapsulate our data in a `Dataset`?"

      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This is true, but other options are also true."
    - content: "It's a good idea to learn about it, especially if we're going to work with larger data in the future."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This is true, but other options are also true."
    - content: "Because it returns our data in batches of 64 images when we iterate over it, which we use later when training."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This is true, but other options are also true."
    - content: "All of the above."
