  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "What kind of images can we use as input in the prediction phase?"
    choices:
    - content: "Any image at all."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Not quite. The model we trained doesn't accept color images, for example."
    - content: "Only images in the training data."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Our model generalizes beyond the training data. In fact, it makes good predictions for test data."
    - content: "Only images in the training data or test data."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. You saw it work for test data that the model hadn't seen during training. You can imagine that it works similarly for other images it hasn't seen."
    - content: "Any image, so long as it's in the format expected by the model."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! The more similar the prediction images are to the images in the training data, the better the predictions are."
