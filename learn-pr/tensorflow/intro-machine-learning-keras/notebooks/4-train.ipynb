This function takes in the outputs of the model $y'$ (the predicted labels) and the actual labels $y$, measures their differences, and combines those into a single output, which we call the loss. The loss gives us a single number that quantifies how similar our predictions are to the actual labels: a high loss indicates that they're different, and a low loss indicates that our predictions are accurate. The loss function most frequently used in classification is cross-entropy loss, and Keras provides several varieties of this loss. Because our dataset includes a single integer label for each example, we use the [SparseCategoricalCrossentropy](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/losses/SparseCategoricalCrossentropy) loss function.\n",

It turns out that problems of this kind fall into the well-studied mathematical area of optimization. The simplest minimization algorithm is gradient descent, and in this sample we use a variation known as [stochastic gradient descent or SGD](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/optimizers/SGD). The training process is roughly as follows: First, the parameters $W$ and $b$ are initialized to random values. We then make predictions using those values, and evaluate the loss function to measure the quality of the predictions. And last, we use the optimizer to adjust the values of $W$ and $b$ such that the loss will be a bit lower next time. We repeat this process until we've found parameters that give us a very small loss value and good predictions.\n",

This is because the categorical cross-entropy function requires a probability distribution as input, meaning that the numbers should be between zero and one, and they should add up to one. Our network produces a vector of numbers that have no upper or lower bound (called *logits*), so we need to normalize them to get a probability distribution. This is typically done using the `softmax` function, and specifying `from_logits=True` automatically calculates the softmax before computing the loss.\n",

Or all 60,000 images at once? Doing a complete training step for each individual image would be inefficient because we would have to perform all the calculations 60,000 times in order to account for every input image. If we included all the input images in $X$, we'd need a lot of memory, and we'd spend a lot of time computing each training step. So we settle for a size in between, called the *mini-batch* size. \n",
