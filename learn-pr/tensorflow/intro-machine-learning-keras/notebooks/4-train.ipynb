Our network produces a vector of numbers that have no upper or lower bound (called \"logits\"), so we need to normalize them to get a probability distribution. This is typically done using the `softmax` function, and specifying `from_logits=True` automatically calculates the softmax before computing the loss.\n",

Or all 60,000 images at once? Doing a complete training step for each individual image would be inefficient because we would have to perform all the calculations 60,000 times in order to account for every input image. If we included all the input images in $X$, we'd need a lot of memory, and we'd spend a lot of time computing each training step. So we settle for a size in between, called the \"mini-batch\" size. \n",

We specify the number of epochs as 2, which means that we want to iterate over the complete set of 60,000 training images twice while training the neural network. We use just two epochs in this sample because we don't want to spend too much time training the network in a demo. In a real project, you will want to increase the number of epochs, which will lead to better accuracy of the resulting model."
