TensorFlow is a popular framework for working with machine learning. This module covers Keras, which is a higher-level and user-friendly API released as part of TensorFlow. For many scenarios, the level of abstraction provided by Keras gives you all the functionality you need, without the complexity of the lower-level concepts of TensorFlow.

At the end of this module, if you feel that you need more flexibility than Keras provides, then the fifth module of this learning path, *Go beyond Keras: Customize with TensorFlow*, shows how to reimplement a portion of the Keras code in this module using lower-level TensorFlow APIs.

Both this module and module five show how you can create a basic neural network using the Fashion MNIST dataset as a data source. You're going to build a neural network that takes images of clothing as input, and then classifies them according to their contents, such as *Shirt*, *Coat*, or *Dress*.

For this module, we assume that you're comfortable with Python, but we don't assume any knowledge of Keras or TensorFlow.

Let's get started!
