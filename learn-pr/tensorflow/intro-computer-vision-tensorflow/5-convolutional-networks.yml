  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
    - content: "How do the number of parameters in a convolutional layer and dense layer correlate?"
      choices:
        - content: "A convolutional layer contains more parameters"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "A convolutional layer contains small filters that have the same weights for the whole image"
        - content: "A convolutional layer contains fewer parameters"
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct, a convolutional layer contains small filters that have the same weights for the whole image"
    - content: "If the size of an input image is **320x200x3**, what would be the size of the tensor after applying a 5x5 convolutional layer with 16 filters?"
      choices:
        - content: "316x196x16"
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "This is correct"
        - content: "316x196x3"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "First dimension should correspond to the number of filters"
        - content: "320x200x3x16"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Color dimension goes away after applying filters. Also, don't forget that sliding window reduces the spatial dimension."
        - content: "320x200x48"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Color dimension goes away after applying filters. Also, don't forget that sliding window reduces the spatial dimension."
    - content: "Which layers do we apply to significantly reduce spatial dimension in multi-layered CNN?"
      choices:
        - content: "Convolution"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Convolution layer only slightly reduces the dimension of the image"
        - content: "Flatten"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Flatten is used to reshape spatial tensor into a linear vector"
        - content: "MaxPooling"
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Pooling layers (such as MaxPooling or AveragePooling) are used to decrease the dimension, usually by a factor of 2"
    - content: "Which layer is used between convolutional base of the network and final linear classifier?"
      choices:
        - content: "Convolution"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Convolution layers are used in convolutional base"
        - content: "Flatten"
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Flatten is used to reshape spatial tensor into a linear vector"
        - content: "MaxPooling"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Pooling layers are often used to reduce the dimension in between convolutional layers"
        - content: "Sigmoid"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Sigmoid is usually used after the final layer to get the probability output"
