  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "Which of the following is true when the model overfits during training?"
    choices:
    - content: "Training and validation accuracy start to decrease"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Not correct"
    - content: "Validation accuracy increases, training accuracy stops to increase"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Not correct"
    - content: "Training accuracy continues to increase, validation accuracy starts decreasing"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "This is correct"
    - content: "Validation accuracy becomes significantly smaller than training accuracy"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This is not an indication of overfitting"
  - content: "We have defined two-layer model, and it does not show any benefits comparing to one-layer model. What could be the problem?"
    choices:
    - content: "The size of the hidden layer is larger than the size of the output layer"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This is quite normal case, and we can expect higher accuracy than one-layer model"
    - content: "The size of the hidden layer is the same as the size of the output layer"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Even in this case we can expect higher accuracy than one-layer model"
    - content: "We have forgotten to specify activation function between layers"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "When we do not specify non-linear activation, two layers are equivalent to one layer"
