  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "When training image classification task on color images of size 32x32 pixels, what would be the dimension of input tensor?"
    choices:
    - content: "32x32 tensor of floats in the range 0..1"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Do not forget to take into account that the image has color"
    - content: "32x32x3 tensor of floats in the range 0..1"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. We have 3 color channels, and each channel is normalized to the range of 0..1"
    - content: "32x32x3 tensor of integers in the range 0..255"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Neural networks are trained with float numbers, and they should be normalized in the range 0..1"
    - content: "32x32x3 tensor of floats in the range 0..255"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "All values should be normalized in the range 0..1"
