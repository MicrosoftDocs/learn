  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "When training image classification task on images with shape 32x32x3, what shape is the input to `Dense` neural layer?"
    choices:
    - content: "32x32x3"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Dense layer always expects its input to be a flat vector"
    - content: "1024"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The dimension of input tensor should correspond to the number of available inputs, eg. 32*32*3"
    - content: "3072"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct, input tensor is just flattened into one vector"
  - content: "Our dataset contains images of size 32x32x3. What should we do in order to train `Dense` neural network on those images?"
    choices:
    - content: "Use `Flatten` layer as the first layer of the network to reshape the images"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This is not the only solution"
    - content: "Change the shape of the training dataset elements to be vectors of length 3072, and use a network of only one `Dense` layer"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This is not the only solution"
    - content: "Any of the above solutions will work"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct, both of those solutions are valid."
  - content: "We want to monitor the accuracy of the model on validation dataset during training. What do we need to do?"
    choices:
    - content: "Specify `metrics=['acc']` in a call to `model.compile`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This is not all"
    - content: "Specify `metrics=['acc']` in a call to `model.fit`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Metrics are specified during model compilation phase"
    - content: "Provide validation dataset using `validation_data` parameter in `model.fit`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This is not all"
    - content: "Options (a) and (c)"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct, you need to make sure that metric is specified and validation dataset is provided"
    - content: "Options (b) and (c)"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Metrics are specified during model compilation phase"
