title: "Go beyond Keras: Customize with TensorFlow"
summary: If you've completed the first module and realized that you need extra flexibility to build or debug your model, then this module is for you. We'll show how you can create a simple neural network for image classification, but this time we'll use lower-level TensorFlow code and explain the foundational concepts needed to understand it. 
abstract: |
  In this module, you will:
  - Learn basic TensorFlow topics, such as tensors, variables, and automatic differentiation.
  - Learn the difference between eager and graph execution.
  - Reimplement the train, test, and prediction phases of an existing Keras project using TensorFlow.
