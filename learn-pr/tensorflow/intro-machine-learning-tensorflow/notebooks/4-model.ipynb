In Keras, we can build our model by simply initializing a sequence of three `Dense` objects with the appropriate activation functions. If we don't want to use Keras, we need to understand the operations performed by a `Dense` layer a bit better and replicate them. It turns out that a `Dense` layer is just about the simplest type of layer we can use, so it's not that hard to understand and replicate. A `Dense` layer takes as input a $W$ parameter, a $b$ parameter, and data $x$ that comes from the previous layer, and produces the following output:\n",
