Refresh the page from the previous module that showed the default NGINX page in your web browser. The page now shows the basic Node.js app that indicates which VM instance in the scale set the app runs on. If you refresh the page a few times, the load balancer should distribute you to another VM instance.

Leave the web browser open. In the next module, you update the app to a newer version from GitHub.
