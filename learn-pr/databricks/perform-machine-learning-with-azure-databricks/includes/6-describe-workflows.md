In your Azure Databricks workspace, open the **ml** folder that you imported within your user folder.

Open the **5. ML Workflows** notebook. Make sure you attach your cluster to the notebook before following the instructions and running the cells within.

Within the notebook, you will:

- Define the data analytics development cycle
- Motivate and perform a split between training and test data
- Train a baseline model
- Evaluate a baseline model's performance and improve it

After you've completed the notebook, return to this screen, and continue to the next step.
