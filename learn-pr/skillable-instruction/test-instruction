# M01-Unit 4 Design and implement a Virtual Network in Azure


## Exercise scenario 

Now you're ready to deploy virtual networks in the Azure portal.

Consider the fictional organization Contoso Ltd, which is in the process of migrating infrastructure and applications to Azure. In your role as network engineer, you must plan and implement three virtual networks and subnets to support resources in those virtual networks.

**Note:** An **[interactive lab simulation](https://mslabs.cloudguides.com/guides/AZ-700%20Lab%20Simulation%20-%20Design%20and%20implement%20a%20virtual%20network%20in%20Azure)** is available that allows you to click through this lab at your own pace. You may find slight differences between the interactive simulation and the hosted lab, but the core concepts and ideas being demonstrated are the same.

#### Estimated time: 20 minutes

The **CoreServicesVnet** virtual network is deployed in the **East US** region. This virtual network will have the largest number of resources. It will have connectivity to on-premises networks through a VPN connection. This network will have web services, databases, and other systems that are key to the operations of the business. Shared services, such as domain controllers and DNS also will be located here. A large amount of growth is anticipated, so a large address space is necessary for this virtual network.

The **ManufacturingVnet** virtual network is deployed in the **West Europe** region, near the location of your organization's manufacturing facilities. This virtual network will contain systems for the operations of the manufacturing facilities. The organization is anticipating a large number of internal connected devices for their systems to retrieve data from, such as temperature, and will need an IP address space that it can expand into.

The **ResearchVnet** virtual network is deployed in the **Southeast Asia** region, near the location of the organization's research and development team. The research and development team uses this virtual network. The team has a small, stable set of resources that is not expected to grow. The team needs a small number of IP addresses for a few virtual machines for their work.

|                     |              |                                   | ResearchSystemSubnet      | 10.40.0.0/24  |

## Task 5: Verify the creation of VNets and Subnets

1. On the Azure portal home page, select **All resources**.

2. Verify that the CoreServicesVnet, ManufacturingVnet, and ResearchVnet are listed.

3 Select **CoreServicesVnet**. 

4. In CoreServicesVnet, under **Settings**, select **Subnets**.

5. In CoreServicesVnet | Subnets, verify that the subnets you created are listed, and that the IP address ranges are correct.

   ![List of subnets in CoreServicesVnet.](../media/verify-subnets-annotated.png)

6. Repeat steps 3 - 5 for each VNet.

Congratulations! You have successfully created a resource group, three VNets, and their associated subnets.
