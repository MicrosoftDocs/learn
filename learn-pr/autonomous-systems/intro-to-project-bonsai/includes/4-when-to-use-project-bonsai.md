In this unit, you'll learn how to determine whether Project Bonsai is a good fit
for your AI-powered control problem. The criteria to consider are:

- Business value
- Available expertise
- Simulation overhead

## Questions to consider

### Business value

- Can you meaningfully optimize the performance of your current automation systems?

Determining the business value of additional optimization is crucial. Developing
an AI solution with Bonsai makes the process **easier**, but not **easy**. You
should make sure the time and resource investment is worth the benefits AI
optimization will provide. Many organizations estimate a 2 percent to 5 percent
increase in a key performance indicator (KPI) or increases in revenue or cost
savings of roughly 1 million USD.

### Available expertise

- Will you have access to the subject matter experts who understand the control
  system?

Subject matter experts are crucial to successful AI development with Bonsai.
The Inkling code (teaching curriculum) for your Bonsai brain is built on
learning from subject matter experts and training will build additional
optimization on top of that experience.

- Does your organization include data scientists or AI experts?
  
Bonsai is designed to make AI development accessible to those without AI
experience. However, having data scientists or other AI experts available can
help in cases where the problem requires advanced usage of the platform. For example,
using explicit reward and terminal functions instead of goals or fine-tuning the
learning algorithm.

### Simulation overhead

- Do you have an existing, machine-teaching compatible simulation of your
  automation systems?

You cannot train a Bonsai brain without providing a simulation in which it can
learn. But not all simulations are appropriate for machine teaching. It is
important to take stock of any existing simulation assets you may already have
access to, and whether your organization has the necessary expertise to modify
an existing simulation model to make it machine teaching compatible or develop a
new one from scratch.

## Apply the criteria

Consider using Project Bonsai when you meet the following criteria:

- There is business value in optimizing your existing automation systems.
- You have an appropriate simulation of your automation systems or you are able
  to build one.
- You have access to subject matter experts who understand the control system.

As mentioned, it is  also ideal, but not essential, that you have AI experts in
your organization who have experience optimizing your automation systems.

### Example of when to use Project Bonsai

Consider our earlier example of making soap. Manufacturing soap is complex and
many variables affect the quality of the finished product. Some of the key
manufacturing challenges include:

- Controlling the vigorousness of the chemical process.
- Predicting the behavior of the machinery (an extruder) in response to changing
  inputs and normal wear-and-tear.

Because of these challenges, it can be hard to optimize the system. Bonsai
brains could provide this organization with improved control over their
automation systems by:

- Automatically signaling their advanced process-control system.
- Adapting quickly to production changeovers.
- Applying short-term process changes when the extruder becomes coated with soap
  over multiple runs.
- Applying long-term process changes as extruder equipment wears.
