> [!WARNING]
> This module is based on a **previous version** of Databricks, and code may not run in the current environment. Updated content is being developed.
>
> The current version of Databricks includes a single node cluster option which can be configured to work in an Azure free trial subscription, and some labs may work under that environment. For other labs you may need to follow the instructions in the note below if you wish to use a free workspace.

> [!NOTE]
> This module's labs can be completed for free using the Databricks 14-day trial, but you cannot use an Azure free trial subscription to create a Databricks trial workspace. To switch a *free trial subscription* to *pay-as-you-go*, go to your profile and [change your subscription offer to *pay-as-you-go*](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/billing/billing-upgrade-azure-subscription). When you create your Azure Databricks workspace, you can select the Trial (Premium - 14-Days Free DBUs) pricing tier to give the workspace access to free Premium Azure Databricks DBUs for 14 days. Please note, with a free workspace and free DBUs you are still responsible for compute cost. In many cases this means you will want to create clusters with a maximum of one node regardless of the instructions of the individual labs.
