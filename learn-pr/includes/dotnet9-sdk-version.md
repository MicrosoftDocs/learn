This module uses the .NET 9.0 SDK. Ensure that you have .NET 9.0 installed by running the following command in your preferred command terminal:

```dotnetcli
dotnet --list-sdks
```

Output similar to the following example appears:

```console
8.0.100 [C:\Program Files\dotnet\sdk]
9.0.100 [C:\Program Files\dotnet\sdk]
```

Ensure that a version that starts with `9` is listed. If none is listed or the command isn't found, [install the most recent .NET 9.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download).
