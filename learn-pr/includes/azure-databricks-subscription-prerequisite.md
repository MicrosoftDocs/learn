  You'll need an Azure subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, create an [account](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account?cid=msft_learn) and add a subscription before you begin. The *Azure free trial subscription* type will not work with Databricks, but the exercises can be completed for free using the Databricks *14 day free trial offer* on a *pay-as-you-go* subscription. Instructions for using the free trial offer are included in the exercises.
