Independent software vendors (ISV) have several options when deciding how they want to package their software products for customers. One popular method is using virtual machine (VM) images to create applications and virtual services that customers deploy to their cloud infrastructure. ISVs install their application software onto a Windows or Linux virtual machine (VM) and configure all the application settings for users. Customers deploy these VM images to their cloud infrastructure, paying ISVs for software licensing fees on a consumption basis. Put another way, VM customers typically only pay for what they use.

## VM benefits for customers

 VM-based applications are popular with customers because they make it easier and faster to deploy VMs to run and manage cloud workloads. Customers don’t have to worry about managing operating systems or complicated application configurations, because the ISV has already done so. Customers deploy the virtual machine image to their cloud infrastructure to start using the application.

VM-based applications also provide flexibility for users to scale up or down as their business needs change. Customers can purchase a VM-based application, use it for a particular project or workload, and then decide whether they want to expand their use of the application to other workloads. Customers only pay for the virtual resources they use, which helps them control costs.

VM-based applications are especially beneficial for customers that want control over the scope of software deployment and application data storage. Since customers deploy VM-based applications to their own cloud infrastructure, they have control over application data and where it’s stored. Customers also have more control over network security and application service levels, because they have ultimate control over their cloud infrastructure.

## VM benefits for ISVs

VM-based applications can help ISVs scale their business. They can optimize their application to run on different VM types and sizes to provide flexibility for their customers. Since customers deploy these applications to their own cloud environment, ISVs don’t have to worry about cloud infrastructure costs associated with using the application. As an ISV grows their customer base, they won’t incur any additional costs.

VM-based applications also help ISVs manage the quality of their software applications. Because ISVs configure and maintain the virtual machine images that contain their software, they can make sure that the application works as intended in different customer environments.

## Choosing VMs for your offer

If you’re wondering whether VMs are the right choice for your software, think about your customers and the nature of the service you’re providing. If your customers want more control over software deployment and application data, VMs could be a good fit. If your application or service works best when deployed in the user’s cloud infrastructure, you might want to package your product using VMs.

To help you decide, we’ll spend the rest of this module explaining how VM-based applications are listed and sold in the commercial marketplace. We’ll discuss VM concepts that will help you build your offer and publish it to the commercial marketplace.
