Today we spent some time covering VM offer basics for the Microsoft commercial marketplace. We started with an overview of VM benefits, highlighting some of the ways that the VM software delivery model can help you and your customers meet your business goals. You learned where customers can find VM offers in the commercial marketplace and the different ways you can engage with new customers. We also explored technical concepts and guidance that will help you build your offer's VM image.
