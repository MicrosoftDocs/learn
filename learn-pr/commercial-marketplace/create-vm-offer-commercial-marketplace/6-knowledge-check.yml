  title: "Knowledge check"
  questions:
  - content: "Which of the following are benefits of the virtual machine (VM) software delivery method?"
    choices:
    - content: "VM-based software gives customers the flexibility to scale software deployment up or down as their business needs change."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "VM-based software does give customers the flexibility to scale software deployment. However, it also gives them more control over application data. Additionally, VMs help Independent Software Vendors (ISV) scale their business."
    - content: "VM-based software gives customers control over their application data and where it gets stored."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "VM-based software gives customers control over their application data because they have control over their Azure environment. However, it also gives customers the flexibility to scale software deployment up or down as their business needs change. VM-based software also helps Independent Software Vendors (ISV) scale their business."
    - content: "Using VMs to package software helps Independent Software Vendors (ISV) scale their business. They don't need to worry about incurring other cloud infrastructure costs when they grow their base of customers because the software is deployed directly to the customer Azure subscription."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Using VMs to deliver software to customers can help Independent Software Vendors (ISV) scale their business. However, the VM software delivery model also provides the above benefits for customers."
    - content: "All of the above."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Great job! The VM software delivery method provides all of these benefits for both software providers and their customers. VMs make it easy for both customers and software providers to scale their businesses because of the flexibility they offer. VM-based software also provides customers with more control over their application data and where it gets stored."
  - content: "Which of the following best describes the difference between the bring-your-own-license (BYOL) and usage-based software license models?"
    choices:
    - content: "Usage-based VM offers appear in both the Azure Marketplace online store and the Azure Marketplace experience in the Azure portal. BYOL offers only appear in the Azure portal."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Both usage-based and BYOL offers appear in the Azure Marketplace online store and the Azure Marketplace experience in the Azure portal."
    - content: "Usage-based VM offers are publicly available to all Azure Marketplace customers. BYOL offers are only made available to customers that the Independent Software Vendor (ISV) specifically identifies when they publish their offer in Partner Center."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Both usage-based and BYOL offers can be made publicly available in Azure Marketplace. Private offers are only made available to customers that the ISV specifically identifies when they publish their offer in Partner Center. To publish a private offer, ISVs enter customer Azure tenant IDs in Partner Center."
    - content: "Customers can deploy usage-based offers directly from Azure Marketplace. BYOL offers can only be deployed from a custom template in the Azure portal."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Customers can deploy both types of VM offers from Azure Marketplace. With BYOL offers, customers are asked to enter a license key before they deploy the VM to their Azure subscription."
    - content: "With the BYOL license model, customers have to purchase a license to use the software outside of Azure Marketplace. With the usage-based license model, customers can purchase a license to the software through Microsoft, streamlining the purchasing process."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! If you choose the BYOL license model, customers have to purchase your software license outside of Azure Marketplace. Usage-based VM offers streamline the purchasing process for customers because they can purchase your software license through Microsoft using the same payment method they use to pay for their Azure subscription."
  - content: "Which of the following criteria need to be met to provide your VM image from the Azure Compute Gallery when completing the technical configuration in Partner Center?"
    choices:
    - content: "The Azure subscription that contains the Azure Compute Gallery with your VM image must be under the same Azure tenant as your Partner Center publisher account."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! If the Partner Center account isn't associated with the same Azure tenant as the Azure Compute Gallery, you can't access your VM image in Partner Center."
    - content: "The user that completes the offer publishing process just needs access rights to the Azure Compute Gallery. Partner Center automatically populates all shared images that the user has access to."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "While the user who completes the offer technical configuration in Partner Center needs access to the Azure Compute Gallery, the Partner Center account also needs to be associated with the Azure subscription that contains the Azure Compute Gallery."
    - content: "The VM image just needs to be generalized to remove all instance-specific identifiers."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "All Azure Marketplace VM images must be generalized before publishing, regardless of whether you plan to provide your VM image from the Azure Compute Gallery or not."
    - content: "The user that completes the offer publishing process needs to provide an access code to link the VM offer with the Azure Compute Gallery that contains the generalized VM images."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The Azure subscription that contains the Azure Compute Gallery with your VM image must be under the same Azure tenant as your Partner Center publisher account."
