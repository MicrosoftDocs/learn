Marketplace Rewards is a program that gives you access to sales, technical, and marketing benefits that help grow your business in the commercial marketplace. These benefits are available to all Microsoft partners with active offers in the commercial marketplace.

Marketplace Rewards benefits are tiered, which means you'll unlock new benefits when your offer hits certain milestones. As you reach new milestones, you're able to choose your benefits from a menu of options in Partner Center.

## Marketplace Rewards benefits

Marketplace Rewards benefits are designed to help you with marketing, sales, and technical activities. The benefits you receive when you publish your offer are differentiated by the [listing option](/partner-center/marketplace/determine-your-listing-type#choose-a-listing-option) you choose. All commercial marketplace listings are eligible for benefits, but you'll unlock more advanced benefits when you publish a transact offer, which customers can purchase through Microsoft.

You can find more information about Marketplace Rewards, including a full list of available benefits, in our [documentation on your commercial marketplace benefits](/partner-center/marketplace/gtm-your-marketplace-benefits).

### Access your benefits in Partner Center

After publishing your solution, take the following steps to access the Marketplace Rewards program in Partner Center.

1. Sign in to Partner Center at https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard.
2. Select **Benefits**.
3. Select **Marketplace Rewards**.
4. Scroll down to find the **Your Benefits** link and select **Enroll into Marketplace Rewards Program**.

After joining the program, you'll see a list of your available benefits. Before you start activating any benefits, make sure your organization's Marketplace Rewards point of contact is identified. If you publish a transact offer, you'll be matched with a rewards engagement manager who will help you activate your benefits.

### Making the most of your Marketplace Rewards benefits

To get the most impact from your Marketplace Rewards benefits, integrate them into your existing business strategy. You can amplify the impact of your existing marketing campaigns and sales activities by timing them to coincide with the benefits you earn from the commercial marketplace.

For additional best practices, check out our [marketing best practices documentation](/partner-center/marketplace/gtm-marketing-best-practices) and download the Azure Marketplace & AppSource best practice guide. You can also get in touch with your engagement manager for help if you've already published your offer to the commercial marketplace.
