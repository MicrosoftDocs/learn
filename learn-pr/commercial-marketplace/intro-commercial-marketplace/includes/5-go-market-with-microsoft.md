By participating in the commercial marketplace, you can unlock various benefits that help to accelerate your offer's growth. The Microsoft Marketplace Rewards program is designed to support the growth and success of partners who publish their solutions on the Microsoft commercial marketplace. This program is included in ISV Success, which is part of the Microsoft AI Cloud Partner Program. It's available at no cost to all participants, aiming to assist you throughout the journey of building, publishing, and selling your offers in the marketplace.

## Marketplace Rewards

Once you publish your offer in the commercial marketplace, you gain access to the Microsoft Marketplace Rewards' sales, technical, and marketing benefits. The listing option you select for your offer, determines the range of benefits you receive as a publisher.

When you opt for a **Contact me** listing for your solution in the Microsoft commercial marketplace, the Marketplace Rewards team initiates contact to offer advice on how to enhance the visibility of your solution.

When you engage customers by offering a **Free trial** listing, enabling deployments through a **Bring-your-own-license (BYOL)** offer, or conducting sales through a **Transact** listing, Microsoft supports your market growth by helping you to increase demand generation and sales activities.

As your commercial marketplace offers hit certain revenue milestones, you're eligible for higher tiers of Marketplace Rewards benefits. Your revenue milestones can be met when customers buy your solutions through Microsoft AppSource, Azure Marketplace, Microsoft's extensive network of resellers, and the various in-product experiences. It's essential to have an active **Transact** offer in the commercial marketplace for you to attain these revenue levels.

The Marketplace Rewards program is designed to support your business development with the commercial marketplace. Microsoft initiates activities aimed at boosting awareness to help secure your first customers, and progressing to more advanced sales and technical benefits as you sell more. All partners who maintain active offers in the commercial marketplace can access these benefits.
