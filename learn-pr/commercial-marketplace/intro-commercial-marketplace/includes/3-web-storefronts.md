When Microsoft partners add their solutions to the commercial marketplace, one way that customers can find their products and services is by visiting the online stores. You decide to go to the [commercial marketplace documentation](/azure/marketplace/overview) to learn more.

## Azure Marketplace

As you read the documentation, you learn that Azure Marketplace is the Microsoft online store for IT solutions. It contains technical software and services that are certified to run on Microsoft Azure.

Azure Marketplace has thousands of solutions that are made to extend directly into users’ Azure infrastructure. Products in this storefront include Azure building blocks, digital cloud services, finished software solutions, and consulting and managed services. Products and services are organized by category and easy to filter, making it easy for customers to find the right app or service.

Your customers can access the Azure Marketplace online store by visiting <https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com>.

Because Azure Marketplace is a part of Azure, your customers can also access these solutions through the Azure portal at <https://portal.azure.com>. Any time Azure users select **Create a resource** on the Azure portal homepage, they’re accessing solutions from Azure Marketplace.

Both the online store and the Azure portal experiences help customers quickly find, try, buy, and deploy solutions to Azure online in minutes.

In addition to the cloud products and services available through both the online store and the portal, the [Azure Marketplace online store](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/) also lists consulting and managed services offered by Microsoft partners to help customers in myriad areas including analytics, DevOps, migration, and security.

## Microsoft AppSource

Microsoft AppSource contains business software that extends directly into Azure, Dynamics 365, Microsoft 365, and the Power Platform. Microsoft AppSource also contains web applications, which are hosted on the cloud and accessed over the internet. Solutions are organized by category and industry and are easy to filter, making it simple for customers to find the right app or service.

Your customers can access the Microsoft AppSource online store by visiting <https://appsource.microsoft.com>.
