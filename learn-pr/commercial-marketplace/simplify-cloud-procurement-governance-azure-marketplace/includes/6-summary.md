You’ve learned how to use Azure Marketplace to simplify software procurement, and it’s time to share the knowledge. As you wrap up your research on Azure Marketplace, you start building a presentation with recommendations for your manager and leadership team. You conclude your presentation with some key takeaways:

- Azure Marketplace saves time by offering a vast catalog of software products and services that any team of developers, cloud architects, security specialists, and IT engineers can use to run and manage workloads in the cloud.

- Finding and trying software in Azure Marketplace is simple, with intuitive ways to search, try out, and test software before purchasing.

- Purchasing on Azure Marketplace removes friction from procurement. A standard contract, custom amendments, consolidated invoicing and private offers with pre-negotiated pricing and terms simplifies purchasing.

- Controlling costs and managing software procurement is easy with Private Azure Marketplace, Azure policy, and Role-Based access control (RBAC).

Your presentation goes well, and it’s time to get your organization ready to start using Azure Marketplace. Now it’s time to put all your learnings into action.
