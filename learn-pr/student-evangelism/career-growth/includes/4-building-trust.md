## Building Trust as an Employee

Good managers are looking for valuable, trustworthy employees who contribute to the organization by providing solid impact. Great managers also value those individuals who bring their whole selves to work, who come as they are, and who grow. Here are some tips on how to provide value to your organization while growing as a person.

## "Manage Up"

The concept of '[managing up](https://hbr.org/2015/01/what-everyone-should-know-about-managing-up)' is not inherently disrespectful to a manager. Rather, it is the idea that managers may not know enough of the details of your current situation to be able to collaborate with you to grow your career. Be as open with your manager as you can.

Here are some questions you can ask your manager to help frame conversations:

"Where do you see me in one year? Five years? Ten years?"

"What can I do to better align myself with the department’s strategies and goals?"

"What resources are available to me to grow my knowledge base and keep learning?"

"What do you see as my strengths? My weaknesses? How can I amplify one and improve the other?"

## Your contributions as an employee

You want to be seen as a team player, but this doesn't mean that you can't take credit for your work. Cultivate collaborative skills as you are assigned projects or volunteer for tasks. 

Keep track of your contributions and your impact as an employee. This can come in handy for one-on-one meetings with both colleagues and managers, and will give you a good idea of your progression.

Communicate with your manager so that they understand the role that you played in delivering it. Lift up your colleagues, as well: team work makes the dream work!
