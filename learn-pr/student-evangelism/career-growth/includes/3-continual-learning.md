## Becoming a Continual Learner

If you just graduated from an educational program, it can be daunting to think that, in engineering disciplines, you must always be ready to learn something new. This doesn't mean that you have to jump right back into a higher degree program, rather, it is embracing a mindset.

A mindset that can be useful that that of 'growth-hacking'. Growth-hacking, a term [derived from the marketing industry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_hacking), can be personalized as valuing rapid experimentation and cross-disciplinary learning. It is all about continual improvement, and that is a mindset that is valuable to cultivate. 

> Microsoft employees are encouraged to move from a 'know-it-all' mentality to a 'learn-it-all', or 'growth' mindset.

In marketing, the idea of 'growth' involves growing value or a user base through experimentation. But as a person, you can borrow this concept to invest in yourself.

Let's think about some ways to growth-hack your learning process and thereby cultivate an 'always learning' mentality.

## Self-study

As Socrates said, "know thyself". How do you learn? Are you a very visual learner? You might benefit from doodling, or drawing sketchnotes as you learn a new concept. If you need structured frameworks around your learning, consider bullet-journaling as you read. 

Do you prefer learning via videos? Make a curated playlist for yourself on YouTube. Are you someone who learns with articles and books? You can get online copies and add highlights and margin notes using various software. You are the owner of your own learning, but there are lots of helpful tools and techniques to aid your process.

Set yourself a goal of learning one new thing every day. This new thing doesn't have to be a tech-related activity! Sometimes even your hobbies can inform your grasp of technical topics.

# Formal study

Some companies support their employees in continuing education in accredited programs. If so, you can weigh the amount of time needed to complete a nanodegree or university degree, and consider applying. Continuing your education is never a waste of time.

# Your 'soft skills'

Continual improvement doesn't only mean learning about new technical advances. It also involves honing your 'soft skills' - your communication, listening, and empathy skills. It turns out that advancing in a career often has more to do with great soft skills rather than stellar technical expertise, although both can and often do go hand in hand.
