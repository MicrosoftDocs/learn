## Data Types

Every value has a type, and the built-in `type` function returns the
type of the result of any expression.

One type we have encountered already is a built-in function. Python
indicates that the type is a `builtin_function_or_method`; the
distinction between a *function* and a *method* is not important at this
stage.

``` {.python}
type(abs)
```
