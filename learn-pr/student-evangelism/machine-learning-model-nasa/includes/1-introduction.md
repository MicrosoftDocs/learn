This module follows the previous two modules within the [Predict rocket launch delays with machine learning](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/paths/machine-learning-predict-launch-delay-nasa/) learning path.

Previously, you imported 300 rows of weather data representing 60 rocket launches plus the couple of days before and after a launch. Through a simplistic version of data cleansing and manipulation, you got your data to a place where you can start using machine learning algorithms to gather knowledge about it.

In this module, you'll use a decision tree classifier to gain knowledge from raw weather and rocket launch data. This module will focus on a local analysis of your data by using scikit-learn.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you'll begin to discover:

- The importance of column choosing.
- How to split data to effectively train and test a machine learning algorithm.
- How to train, test, and score a machine learning algorithm.
- How to visualize a tree classification model.

## Prerequisites

- Basic Python experience
- Have clean data about rocket launches
