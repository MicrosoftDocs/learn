The scientific areas of interest for NASA research is vast. So why are we focusing on how code can play a role?

Simply put, Microsoft is one of the leaders in innovation around coding tools and data science services. With tools like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and the services that [Azure offers to explore data](https://azure.microsoft.com/overview/ai-platform/) you can get started within an hour exploring data and discovery insights about that data. 

But more than that, the new services offered by many different companies create a new type of research. With the hard work and dedication of NASA scientists when we initially collected rock samples and tracked weather patterns for launches, we now have massive amounts of data that allow us to do analysis on large numbers of rocks instead of individual rocks. We can now better equip astronauts with strategies for finding, identifying, and collecting rock samples that we know will further understanding, and we can begin to more accurately predict the right dates and times for rocket launches, saving money and increasingly the likelihood of success. 

The type of research and innovation offered by services like Azure don't replace the critical work that happens before and after data exploration, but it does add another topic to the conversation. And with NASA's data being free and open for all to use, it also opens the doors for more people interested in learning about Space and potentially discovering something new to begin their journey from younger ages. 

So while you may not be an expert geologist, or an astronaut, or a literal rocket scientist - if you have the passion, interest, and persistance to begin this journey, the Microsoft Learn modules with NASA themes might be a *great* place to start. 

Even if Space Exploration isn't your passion - the problems that we present here offer creative ways of discovering through data given constraints you might face elsewhere. Without the ability to take a quick trip back to the moon, we have to deal with incomplete data about the rock samples and still learn from them. Without the ability to launch a bunch of rockets on different days to determine the best weather conditions, we have to to still accurately predict, years in advance, when a rocket should launch *and* be able to abort if conditions prove to be poor. These challenges in NASA-specific endeavors can be similar to other problems you might face in other industries.
