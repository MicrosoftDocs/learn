[Artemis](https://www.nasa.gov/specials/artemis/) is NASA's program to land the first woman and the next man on the Moon by 2024. The specific goal of this program is to begin to understand what infrastructure and preparation is needed to eventually send an astronaut to step foot on Mars.

## How Do We Learn

Artemis is more than an exploration of the Moon, it's a discovery of how humans and machines might make it possible to explore farther into our universe, and stay on foreign planets for longer. NASA is planning a number of experiments to launch during the Artemis program to gather information, test hypothesis, and develop conclusions that can be extrapolated to other planets. 

The experiments will require a collaboration between the experts on Earth, the astronauts "in the field" (on the Moon), and the machines that are programmed on Earth and acitoned on the Moon. With communication being more difficult between Earth and the Moon, and the inability to "just go back for another quick look", the preparation is starting years in advance to ensure we have the highest likelihood of success in our discoveries. 

## What Innovations Are Happening

The Artemis Program is pushing the science behind space exploration in six key areas:
- Exploration Ground Systems - With more powerful rockets and more resources needed on the space craft for longer staying and further reaching crewed missions, the ground systems on Earth need to be upgraded and improved.
- Space Launch System - The new rocket being designed isn't just for the Moon, it is a rocket design meant to be used for future launches to planets like Mars. The launch system needed to launch this new rocket into space needs to be more flexible and evolvable than previous versions to account for varying destinations and cargo.
- Orion - The spacecraft that will be used both for the crew to enter the lunar orbit *and* return to Earth safely needs to be designed to withstand extreme heat due to the conditions during re-entry into Earth's atmosphere.
- Gateway - The communication between the astronauts on the Moon (or beyond) and the experts on Earth is more critical as we go further and stay for longer. The Gateway outpost is being redesigned with both commercial and international partners so that we can prepare for future missions.
- Lunar Landers - Lunar Landers are what allow astronauts to move from the lunar orbit to the surface of the Moon reliably and safely. Tehse systems need to be able to dock to both the Orion and the Gateway in order to support the discoveries and sustainability of conducting research on the Moon or other planets.
- Artemis Generation Spacesuits - Though astronauts have walked on the Moon in the past with success, the new exploration goals requires that suits be longer lasting and more flexible to allow astronauts to stay in them longer, move more easily, and be safe through launch and re-entry to Earth.
