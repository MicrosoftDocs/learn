In July 2020, [the NASA STEM team gave a three-hour webinar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmSXxbR5WnU?azure-portal=true) introducing some of the unique ways in which they're inspiring collaboration with other government agencies, industry partners, and individuals like you who might be excited by, and interested in, the exploration of space.

The NASA STEM team's goal is to engage the next generation of scientists and contributors. In the webinar mentioned above, the focus was on pre-university students, because they're the Artemis Generation.

## NASA STEM programs

[Mike Kincaid](https://www.nasa.gov/people/mike-kincaid/), the Associate Administrator for the Office of STEM Engagement, kicked off this event with the African Proverb:
"If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together."

Mike did so to highlight the importance of collaboration. NASA scientists shouldn't be trying to solve problems in a vacuum (pun intended). The problems involve so much data, expertise, and creativity that the more perspectives and unique approaches to problem solving that are involved, the more likely it is that there will be new discoveries.

There are three programs that have recently launched for K-12 students:
- [NASA STEM @ Home](https://www.nasa.gov/stem-at-home-for-students-k-4.html?azure-portal=true): Grades K-4

There are many programs targeted to higher education students as well, which can be found on the [NASA STEM Engagement website](https://www.nasa.gov/stem/highereducation/index.html?azure-portal=true).
