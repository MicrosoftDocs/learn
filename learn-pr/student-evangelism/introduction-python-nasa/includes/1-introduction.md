Data plays a huge role in almost every scientific area of study, in today's world more than ever, because we now have massive amounts of data that is often publicly available. 

This Microsoft Learn module is the first of a series that highlight the kinds of scientific discovery and data that NASA uses throughout their space exploration. From how to leave our atmosphere safely, to which rocks to collect when astronauts are walking on the Moon, data plays a role in every step of that journey. 

Furthermore, learning how to explore and understand the massive amounts of data that is collected and analyzed can be made easier with the right technology tools. For example, with the use of free tools and languages, such as Visual Studio Code and Python, you can start to discover more about the universe our planet is floating in, and how it impacts your everyday life. 

While this data exploration journey is one that can be lifelong, this first learning path will set you up with the basic tools to get started and this module in particular will provide the context for why these problems are interesting in the first place.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you'll scratch the surface (pun intended) of how to start the data exploration. You'll learn:

- What a programming language is
- How to install Visual Studio Code and about the benefits of this code editor
- How to install extensions to enhance the Visual Studio Code experience
- How to install Python and why it is such a popular programming language
- How to run a basic Jupyter Notebook within Visual Studio Code

## Prerequisites

- A Windows, Mac, or Linux computer
- Knowledge of how to download programs from the Internet
