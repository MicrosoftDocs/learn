  questions:
  - content: "What type of machine learning model is effective for predicting one value based on many other values?"
    choices:
    - content: "Decision Tree"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Decision trees are typically used in classification problems."
    - content: "PCA"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. PCA (Principal Component Analysis) is typically used in anomoly detection problems."
    - content: "K-Means"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. K-Means is typically used in clustering problems."
    - content: "Linear Regression"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Regression is the act of taking many complex data pieces and determining a numerical outcome."
  - content: "What is one way to create randomized sample data that is close to accurate?"
    choices:
    - content: "Use a random number within the standard deviation of input values for a machine learning algorithm."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The standard deviation represents a reasonable range of values for an accurate prediction."
    - content: "Using the `random.randrange` using the smallest and largest number on input values"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While it is *possible* that a random number within that range is effective, the standard deviation will give a more accurate range."
    - content: "It is never useful to create randomized sample data."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While randomized sample data shouldn't be used to make critical decisions, they can serve as effective testing data."
    - content: "Any integer between 0 and 100."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While it is *possible* that a random number within that range is effective, the standard deviation will give a more accurate range."
  - content: "Azure Static Web Apps take significant expertise to develop and deploy."
    choices:
    - content: "True - Azure Static Web Apps are typically used by web developers with decades of experience."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Azure Static Web Apps, while powerful for professionals, are also novice-friendly!"
    - content: "True - Azure Static Web Apps are only for expert Flask developers."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While there is a Microsoft Learn module that guides you through creating and deploying a Flask app using Azure Static Web Apps, that is one of many options and novice-friendly."
    - content: "False - Azure Static Web Apps have many entrypoints and can be novice-friendly."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Azure Static Web Apps can be created and deployed in numerous ways and for numerous languages, some more novice-friendly and others better for more experienced developers."
    - content: "False - Azure Static Web Apps are only for learners who are just starting out."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While there are entrypoints to using Azure Static Web Apps for novices, there are also a lot of ways they can support more experienced developers' workflows."
