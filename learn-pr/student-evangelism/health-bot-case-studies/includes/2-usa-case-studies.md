Microsoft partners are using the Azure Health Bot service to build bots that address a wide range of healthcare-specific use cases. For example:

- Insurers have built bots that give their customers an easy way to look up the status of a claim and ask questions about benefits and services.
- Providers have built bots that triage patient issues with a symptom checker, help patients find appropriate care, and look up nearby doctors.

A great showcase for the impact of Health Bot to healthcare organizations is its wide use during the most challenging health crisis in decades, the COVID-19 pandemic. Some of those partners in the United States are as follows.

## CDC

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) bot, which utilizes the Azure Health Bot service, can quickly:

- Assess the symptoms and risk factors for people worried about infection.
- Provide information and suggest a course of action, such as contacting a medical provider.  
- Help those who don't need in-person medical care to manage the illness safely at home.

## Providence

One of the largest health systems in the United States created a [healthcare chatbot named Grace](https://www.providence.org/news/uf/623601749) by using the Azure Health Bot service. Providence created Grace to help answer patients' questions online. 

By using CDC guidelines and its own clinical protocols, Providence then built a Coronavirus Assessment Tool in just three days for the communities that it serves. The tool helps people decide whether they should seek medical attention for their respiratory symptoms.  

## Walgreens

Walgreens, the global pharmacy and healthcare retail provider, [used Azure Health Bot to expand the Find Care platform](https://customers.microsoft.com/story/812836-walgreens-boots-alliance-retailers-azure-bot-service-cognitive-services) to include a COVID-19 risk assessment. Customers can use it to assess their risk of COVID-19 based on CDC guidelines. 

## Aurora Health Care

[Aurora Health Care](https://www.aurorahealthcare.org/) created a bot system to help patients triage symptoms. Based on outcomes of the symptom checker, the system directs patients to an appropriate care provider.
