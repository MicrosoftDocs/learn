In this module, we'll discuss a few case studies for the Azure Health Bot service. Health Bot is a cloud platform that enables developers in healthcare organizations to build and deploy compliant, AI-powered virtual health assistants and health bots that help them improve processes and reduce costs.  

A study by Juniper Research found that chatbots could lead to cost savings of more than $8 billion by 2020. In another survey published by research firm Statista, 27 percent of people would prefer to answer sensitive health questions posed by virtual assistants than by people. The research strongly indicates a need for the Azure Health Bot, where customers don't have to start from scratch to implement a bot.

The Health Bot service has medical intelligence and knowledge, such as a symptom checker and information about conditions, medications, and procedures. It has language models trained to understand healthcare terminology. It understands if a user is complaining, asking about what doctor to see, or thinking about side effects of a medication.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you will:

- Learn about the real-life use of Health Bot through case studies in the United States, the Middle East, and Europe.
