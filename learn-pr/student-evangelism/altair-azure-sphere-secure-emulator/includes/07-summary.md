* Azure Sphere is secure by design and by default.
* The Azure IoT Central network endpoints must be declared in the `AllowedConnections` section of the *app_manifest.json* file.
* The MQTT broker test.mosquitto.org network endpoint must be declared in the `AllowedConnections` section of the *app_manifest.json* file.
* Communications with Azure IoT Central and the MQTT broker are secured with certificates.
