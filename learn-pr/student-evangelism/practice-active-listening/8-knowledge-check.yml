quiz:
  questions:
  - content: 'Which one of the following ground rules is recommended in group discussions?'
    choices:
    - content: 'Share the air with other people by providing them the opportunity to speak and by listening to them respectfully.'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. It's important to give others as much chance to speak as you want for yourself. By listening to others fully and patiently, you create an environment of respect and inclusiveness."
    - content: "Develop an inclusive atmosphere by using We statements to include everyone's perspective in your statements."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Using We statements assumes that others share your opinion and vantage point and isn't inclusive of the listeners' feelings. Using I statements enables you to take ownership of your own feelings while providing others the opportunity to do the same."
    - content: 'Assume that what you hear and understand always reflects the true intent of the speaker.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Intent and impact aren't always the same. People often say things in a way that doesn't accurately reflect their intentions or might be received incorrectly. Always assume positive intent."
  - content: 'When a person repeats in their own words what someone is telling them, what communication technique are they using?'
    choices:
    - content: 'Active listening'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Active listening is the act of giving someone your complete attention when they're sharing and you're listening to understand."
    - content: 'Mirroring'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Mirroring is a communication technique that you can use to signal that you're listening to the speaker and also convey your understanding. It's a component of active listening."
    - content: 'Effective communication'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'Incorrect. Effective communication consists of several components, one of which is active listening.'
  - content: 'Which aspect of active listening is especially important in teams?'
    choices:
    - content: 'Taking good notes during meetings.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Although taking good notes is important, it's not a component of active listening."
    - content: 'Trying on the perspective of the person speaking.'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. One important aspect of active listening that's especially important in team settings is to try on the perspective of the person speaking to gain a deeper sense of their position, even when you disagree with what they're saying."
    - content: 'Always agreeing with the person speaking.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. You don't need to agree with someone to actively listen to them."
  - content: 'Which one of the following statements describes the advantages of conducting small group discussions?'
    choices:
    - content: 'It allows people who are shy or uncomfortable sharing in a larger group to participate more freely.'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: 'Correct. Some people might be more comfortable sharing their views and feelings in a one-on-one conversation or a smaller group instead of in front of many people. Small group discussions are beneficial for them to express themselves openly.'
    - content: 'It provides fewer opportunities for confrontations between group members.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'Incorrect. This might not always be true. In a smaller group, there might be more chances of two or more people not getting along with each other or disagreeing with each other in a more fractious manner.'
    - content: "It's easier for facilitators to monitor and mediate and allows for a greater degree of control."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This isn't always true. People are more apt to express their feelings openly in a smaller group, which increases the chances of the discussion getting out of control or going off on a tangent."
