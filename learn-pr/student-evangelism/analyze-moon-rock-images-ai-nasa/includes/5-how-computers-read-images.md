Now that we have our data cleaned and separated a question might arise to how the computer actually reads these images. As somewhat of a spoiler, they cannot read images the same way you or I read images.

If you know a little bit about computers, you know that computers read things in binary (0s and 1s). So how can a computer read a complex image as only 0s and 1s? Well, if you break an image down far enough, it too, is just a combination of 0s and 1s.

Images will look like the below after computers transform them into numbers:

<img src="../analyze-moon-rock-images-ai-nasa/media/pixels.png" width="500" align="center">

The image is broken down into pixels and each pixel has a specific color that is identified by a code. The computer will break an image down into these codes and then it can read and decipher the picture.
