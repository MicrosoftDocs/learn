Now that you have some background information on what Artificial Intelligence is and how it can be used, you can start creating your own program utilizing it. The libraries that you installed will be a great starting step into creating the rock classification program because they will give you a base model that you can train to complete the task at hand.

In this Microsoft Learn module, you'll use Visual Studio Code, Python and Jupyter Notebooks to read in and clean-up images of rocks that will be used to create and train an artificial intelligence model.

## Learning Objectives
