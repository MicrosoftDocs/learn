Integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI)) into this process could improve the collection process for both humans and rovers. For example, we could send astronauts to the moon armed with a computer that can take pictures of rocks and tell the astronaut what type it likely is and the importance of that type for the general collection we have back here on Earth. This same computer could be placed in a rover that could autonomously drive around the moon and scan for rocks that we need.

With AI, the astronauts could more quickly collect rocks, and spend a few moments doing a secondary analysis to determine if they think it is the correct type and whether they should bring it back to Earth. This allows the astronauts to spend more time being trained on accurately identifying rocks instead of scanning the floor for them. It also could potentially allow astronauts to spend more time identifying rocks while on the Moon, since they may not have to spend as much time searching for them in the first place. The computer could also collect metadata (location, temperature, light exposure, etc) and with the astronauts feedback on accuracy, the model for the computer identifying the correct rocks could be improved over time. 

## AI on Earth

As mentioned, AI performs better when the sample data is cleaner. Not just when the rocks are physically clean, but when the images of the rocks are similar in lighting (and therefore visual coloring of the rock), clean edges between the rock and the background, and clear indication of size with appropriate scaling. If there was an AI that would help identify, classify, and keep track of these samples, then we could have clear instructions for how to take the images (aka the data to inform the AI) and move the [lunar rock curation](https://curator.jsc.nasa.gov/) and lunar rock research towards more nuanced problems to be solved. 

## The Future of AI in Space 

While AI and image quality today might not be good enough to take a satellite image of a planet's surface and give an overview of the types of rocks that are on it, we can start to understand where AI *can* help and where it is limited.
