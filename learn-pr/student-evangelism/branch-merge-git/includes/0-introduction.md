Imagine that you're a new software developer at a firm that writes avionics software for commercial airliners. Quality control is critical, and developers work in small teams by using Git for version control. You already know a little bit about Git. You've used it to track your changes, fix mistakes, and collaborate with other developers through a shared repo and by using pull requests. However, you know that Git has even more to offer, and you're excited to learn!

You've already created a small website that you and your friends can use to practice Git by sharing pictures of your cats. You enlisted a couple friends who are software developers to help out.

As your project progresses, you want to make collaborating with your friends easier, so you can all work on features of the website without conflicts or wasted effort.
