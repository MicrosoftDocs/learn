Another crucial tool is the browser. Web developers rely on the browser to observe how their code runs on the web, it's also used to view visual elements of a web page that are written in the editor, like HTML.

Many browsers come with developer tools (DevTools) that contain a set of helpful features and information to assist developers to collect and capture important insights about their application. For example: If a web page has errors, it's sometimes helpful to know when they occurred. DevTools in a browser can be configured to capture this information.
