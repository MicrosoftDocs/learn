quiz:
  questions:
    - content: What is the difference between a class and an object?
      choices:
        - content: They're the same thing.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. They're not the same thing. A class is a blueprint. The object is what you create from the blueprint and what is actually created when you run your program.
        - content: A class is a blueprint. An object is the concrete instance you build from the blueprint.
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: Correct. A class is where you write all the code. You later create an instance of the class, which is a so-called object.
        - content: A class has data and an object doesn't.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. The class is the object's blueprint. Whatever the class has, the object has too.
        - content: A class has methods and an object doesn't.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. The class is the object's blueprint. Whatever the class has, the object has too.
    - content: How does Python implement accessors?
      choices:
        - content: It uses prefixes. One underscore, `_`, at the beginning of the name indicates this variable is _protected_. Two underscores, `__`, make the variable _private_ and will raise an exception if assigned.
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: Correct. Using prefixes on the variable name is how Python uses accessors and is able to hide your data at different levels.
        - content: It uses keywords _private_ and _public_.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. Languages like Java and C#, for example, use private and public. Python uses prefixes on the naming of the variable.
        - content: Everything in a Python class is hidden by default and must be exposed by adding methods that return the variables' values.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. Everything defined on a class is public. You need to change the variable naming by using prefixes to _hide_ data from other objects.
        - content: Add the decorator @public or @private to make something public or private.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. Python makes heavy use of decorators. These two mentioned decorators don't exist.
    - content: Choose the best explanation that explains the parameter `self`.
      choices:
        - content: It's a parameter that refers to the object instance. You can also use `this`.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. While it's true that `self` refers to the object instance, you shouldn't use `this`. The name `self` has no special meaning, but it is a convention that makes your code more readable to other Python programmers.
        - content: The `self` parameter refers to the underlying class of the object.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. The `self` parameter refers to the underlying object instance, not the class.
        - content: The only time `self` is used is to refer to members of the object, and it's passed as a parameter.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. It's true that `self` is passed as a parameter if the method wants to refer to members of the object. However, you need `self` as well when you add variables to the object instance at construction time. 
        - content: The `self` parameter refers to the object instance. Assignment to `self` means that the attribute ends up on the object instance.
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: Correct. The `self` parameter is passed to methods that need access to members on the object. In any kind of communication with the object instance, the `self` parameter needs to be used. It's used to refer to attributes on the instance and methods. If you don't add an attribute to `self`, it will be treated as a temporary variable.
