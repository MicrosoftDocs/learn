In this module, you learned the essential concepts underlying object-oriented programming in Python. You learned that objects are instances of classes and that all variables are objects in Python. You learned how to write classes of your own and infuse them with methods and attributes. You learned how to instantiate those classes, and how to create classes that inherit from others. You even learned how to override methods in subclasses. That's not everything there is to know about OOP, but it's a great start.
