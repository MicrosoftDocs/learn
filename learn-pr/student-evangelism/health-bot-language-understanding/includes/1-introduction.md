Natural language understanding (NLU) is a specific subtopic of natural-language processing (NLP). It's defined as the ability to *transform* a linguistic statement to a representation that enables you to understand your users naturally. NLU is challenging and defined as an *AI-hard* problem.

In Azure, language understanding is supported through the Language Understanding Intelligent Service (LUIS), which is more commonly known as Language Understanding. LUIS is a cloud-based conversational AI service that applies custom machine learning intelligence to a user's conversational, natural language text. LUIS predicts overall meaning and pulls out relevant, detailed information to provide NLU to your data. By using LUIS, you don't need in-house AI expertise or any prior machine learning knowledge. With only a few clicks, you can build your own conversational AI application.

Knowledge of basic concepts related to LUIS and NLU along with other terminology is essential in creating your own Azure Health Bot instance.
