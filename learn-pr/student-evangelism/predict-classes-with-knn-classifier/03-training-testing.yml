  questions:
    - content: 'Which of the following is true?'
      choices:
        - content: 'In k-nearest neighbors classification, increasing the value of k will always improve accuracy on the test set.'
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect.
        - content: 'In k-nearest neighbors classification, increasing the value of k can never improve accuracy on the test set.'
          explanation: Incorrect.
          isCorrect: false
        - content: 'In nearest neighbors classification, the test set should be selected to include some data points from the training set and some data points that are not in the training set.'
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. The training and test sets should contain different data points
        - content: 'The test set should be used only once, we should not use the test set to select the best value of k'
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: Correct. The purpose for the test set is to see how good our model will do on data it has not seen before. Selecting the best k based on the test set will create bias and defeat the purpose of a test set.
