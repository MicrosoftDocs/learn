quiz:
  questions:
  - content: "If you want to deploy MLOps, what is the correct sequence of deployment?"
    choices:
    - content: "Build and Train; Package and Deploy; Monitor and Retrain"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. You first create the model, then you can package and deploy the model. The model is monitored and retrained as needed."
    - content: "Monitor and Retrain; Package and Deploy; Build and Train"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Build and Train is the first step in the deployment of MLOps."
    - content: "Package and Deploy; Monitor and Retrain; Build and Train"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. You can't package and deploy a model without building it first."
  - content: "MLOps brings the philosophy of DevOps to the Data science community. In the absence of MLOPs, how would the work of a data scientist be impacted?"
    choices:
    - content: "A data scientist won't be able to conduct experiments."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A data scientist can conduct experiments without MLOps."
    - content: "A data scientist won't be able to test models."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A data scientist can test models without MLOps."
    - content: "A data scientist wouldn't be able to collaborate with developers efficiently."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. A data scientist wouldn't be able to collaborate effectively with developers in the absence of MLOps because they would be each following different workflow."
  - content: "A company has decided to implement MLOps on Edge devices. Which step would they need to implement before deploying MLOPs on Edge devices?"
    choices:
    - content: "The company should deploy IoT Edge and capture data from sensors."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Without IoT Edge being operational, you can't acquire data to build models."
    - content: "The company should be able to visualize data from sensors."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The ability to visualize data isn't a prerequisite for MLOps on edge devices."
    - content: "Developers should follow CI/CD processes before MLOps is deployed."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The ability to use CI/CD isn't a prerequisite for MLOps on edge devices."
