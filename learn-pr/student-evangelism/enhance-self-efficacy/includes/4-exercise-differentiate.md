In this exercise, you'll look through a set of code samples. The idea is to evaluate your self-efficacy and compare it to your self-confidence.

Review the following snippets of code. There are differences between them. Spend a few minutes trying to spot these differences, and then answer the questions that follow.

## Snippet 1

```java
String[] array = new String[1]; array[0] = “hello”; System.out.println(array[0].length());

int[] array = new int[5]; array[0] = 1;

for ( int i = 1; i < array.length; i++ ) array[i] = array[i-1]\*2;
```

## Snippet 2

```java
String() array = new String[1]; array[1] = “hello”; System.out.println(array[0].length[]);

int[] array = new int[5]; array[1] = 1;

for ( int i = 1; i < array\*length; i++ ) array[i] = array[i-1]\*2;
```

## Evaluate snippets

- What's your level of self-efficacy in creating and debugging code?
- Imagine doing this task on a much larger scale and under a tight deadline. How would you approach such a situation?
- How do you rate your self-confidence? Is it at a similar level as your self-efficacy in programming and debugging?
