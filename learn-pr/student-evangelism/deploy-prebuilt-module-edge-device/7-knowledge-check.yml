quiz:
  questions:
  - content: "Your company has recently decided to explore industrial IoT solutions. You want to simulate the working of various machines in a production environment. Which alternative would you recommend in this situation?"
    choices:
    - content: "Buy data from external sources."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Buying external data can be expensive and may not simulate exact conditions."
    - content: "Simulate the working of an edge device through a module deployed to the edge."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Simulating the data through an edge module provides a flexible and a relatively inexpensive way to mimic the working of sensors in the field."
    - content: "Use historical data."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "While historical data may provide some insights, it may not simulate conditions accurately."
  - content: "You deployed a module to the edge and expect it to simulate data. How do you ensure the module is running?"
    choices:
    - content: "View the generated data."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "If the module is running, it should simulate data like any other sensor in the field."
    - content: "Check the status of the module."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Any status doesn't indicate if the module is running unless you see the simulated data."
    - content: "Run a test for the module status."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Any test does not indicate if the module is running unless you see the simulated data."
  - content: "You're able to view generated temperature data from a simulated device. What else could you look for apart from the temperature data?"
    choices:
    - content: "Data about the pressure."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "It isn't known if pressure is relevant to the observations or not."
    - content: "Anomalies in temperature data."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "While anomalies could be useful, we do not know enough information about detecting anomalies from simulated data."
    - content: "Ensure that data about the ambient conditions is simulated."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "This sensor might be in a server room, on a factory floor, or on a wind turbine. Hence, the ambient data is relevant for analysis."
