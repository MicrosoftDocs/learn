In this module, you learned about the concept of custom handlers. A custom handler is what makes it possible to use any language that supports HTTP primitives and author Azure functions. Custom handlers support all the things you're used to with Azure functions, like triggers and bindings.

You looked into how to develop functions that support both HTTP triggers and queue triggers. You also emulated a message queue by using Azurite and Azure Storage Explorer.
