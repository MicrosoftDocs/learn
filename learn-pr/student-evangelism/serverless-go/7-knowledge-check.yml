  questions:
    - content: How can you make Azure Functions find your compiled app?
      choices:
        - content: Set `defaultExecutablePath` in the _host.json_ file.
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: Correct. That's the right place to point out the compiled app path.
        - content: Set the `executionPath` property in the _function.json_ file for the function endpoint.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. You should set `defaultExecutablePath` in the _host.json_ file.
        - content: Set `defaultExecutablePath` in the _function.json_ file for the function endpoint.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. You should set `defaultExecutablePath` in the _host.json_ file.
    - content: Can any language or runtime use custom handlers?
      choices:
        - content: Yes. There are no limitations.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. The selected language or runtime needs to support HTTP primitives.
        - content: Yes, as long as it supports HTTP primitives.
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: Correct. A runtime or language that supports HTTP primitives can be used to create Azure functions.
        - content: Yes, but only languages with first-class support. 
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. The point of custom handlers is to support languages and runtimes that don't have first-class support.
