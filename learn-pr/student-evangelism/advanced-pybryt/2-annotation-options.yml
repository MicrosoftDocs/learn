        Which of the following calls caps the number of times that the `lst` variable is tracked at five times?
      choices:
        - content: "`pybryt.Value(lst, limit=5)`"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Not quite. The `limit` option requires the annotation to be named."
        - content: '`pybryt.Value(lst, name="lst", limit=5)`'
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct!"
        - content: '`pybryt.Value(lst, group="lst", limit=5)`'
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Not quite. The `group` and `limit` options are unrelated."
    - content: "What is the purpose of the `group` option?"
      choices:
        - content: "To group together annotations that represent the same variable"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Not quite. This is what the `name` option is for."
        - content: "To prevent duplicate messages from being provided to the student"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Not quite. This is one effect of the `name` option."
        - content: 'To group together annotations that represent a single problem so that they can be run as a subset of the whole reference'
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct!"
    - content: |
        Suppose we create a reference with the following code:

        ```python
        for i in range(10):
            pybryt.Value(foo(i), name="foo", limit=5)
            pybryt.Value(bar(i), group="foo")
            pybryt.Value(baz(i), name="baz")
        ```

        How many annotations are in the reference?
      choices:
        - content: "30"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Not quite. Think about the use of `limit`."
        - content: "25"
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct!"
        - content: "15"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Not quite. The value of `group` has no effect on `name` or `limit` (event if they're the same)."
