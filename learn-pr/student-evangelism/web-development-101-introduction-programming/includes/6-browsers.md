Running your programs on the internet requires some sort of client to help you view the output. A common form of client is a web browser, with which you can view and interact with the content. Web browsers play a crucial role in the development of web applications. They are the primary tool developers use to test and debug their applications. Modern browsers come equipped with powerful developer tools that provide a wide range of functionalities, making the development process more efficient and effective.

### Browser developer tools

Many browsers come with developer tools that contain helpful features and information to assist developers with collecting and capturing important insights about their applications. 

One of the key features of a browser's developer tools is the ability to inspect the Document Object Model (DOM). The DOM represents the structure of a web page and allows developers to interact with the HTML and CSS of a page directly from the browser. This means developers can experiment with changes in real-time, without having to edit and reload their code.

Another important feature is the JavaScript console, which allows developers to write, test, and debug JavaScript code directly in the browser. The console also displays errors and warnings, helping developers identify and fix issues as they arise.

Network tools are also a vital part of a browser's developer toolkit. They allow developers to monitor network requests and responses, check load times, and optimize performance. This is particularly useful when working with APIs or debugging issues related to data fetching.
