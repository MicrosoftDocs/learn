Knowing how a program runs and what data it relies on is an important first step toward understanding how to create your own programs.

## Syntax and statements

In programming, syntax refers to the set of rules that dictate how programs written in a particular programming language must be structured. It's like the grammar rules of a language. Each programming language has its own unique syntax, and understanding this syntax is crucial for writing correct and efficient code.

A statement, on the other hand, is a single instruction that a program executes. You can think of it as a sentence in a natural language. In most programming languages, statements are executed in sequence, one after the other. They can do things like assigning a value to a variable, calling a function, or controlling the flow of the program with conditionals and loops. Each statement in a program must adhere to the syntax rules of the language it's written in.

## Programs are data driven

In the realm of programming, every application is essentially data-driven, even if it might not seem so at first glance. This is because at their core, all programs operate on data. They take data as input, manipulate it, and produce data as output. This data can come in many forms, such as user input, files, network signals, or even the internal state of the program. For example, a game program might take player actions as input data, update the game state based on these actions, and then output data to the screen to reflect the new state. So, even if an application doesn't explicitly handle data like a database or analytics application would, it's still fundamentally operating on data. Understanding this concept is key to understanding how programming works.

## Flow control and error handling

Flow control and error handling are two fundamental concepts in programming that help ensure your application runs smoothly and as expected.

Flow control is about determining the order in which the statements in your program are executed. This can be done using various structures like loops (for repeating actions), and conditional statements (like 'if' and 'else' for making decisions). For example, you might use an 'if' statement to check if a user has entered valid data before processing it.

Error handling, on the other hand, is about dealing with problems that arise while your program is running. No matter how carefully you write your code, errors can still occur. These could be due to unexpected user input, unavailable resources, or bugs in the code. Error handling allows your program to catch these errors when they occur and decide how to respond, whether that's by logging the error, displaying a message to the user, or even attempting to recover from the error and continue running. This helps ensure that your application can handle unexpected situations gracefully, without crashing or producing incorrect results.
