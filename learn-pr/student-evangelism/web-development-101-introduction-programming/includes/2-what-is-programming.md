Before you start learning to program, it's important to understand what programming is and what a computer program is.

## What is a computer program? 

A program, in the world of computers, is a set of instructions that a computer follows to complete a task. Think of it like a recipe. Just as a recipe tells you the steps to make a dish, a program tells the computer what steps to take to complete a task.

These tasks can be anything from simple calculations, like adding two numbers, to complex operations, like running a video game. When you're using a web browser, a word processor, or a video game, you're using a program.

Programs are written in different programming languages, like Python, JavaScript, or C++. Each language has its own rules (syntax) and is used for different types of tasks. For example, JavaScript is often used for web development, while Python is popular for data analysis.

To write a program, you need to learn a programming language and understand how to solve problems in a logical way. This process is called coding or programming. It's like learning a new language, but instead of communicating with people, you're communicating with computers.

Remember, every app or software you use on your computer or phone is a program. So, learning to program can allow you to create your own apps, build websites, analyze data, and much more. It's a powerful skill in our digital world.
