As a student, you might be interested in learning how to get started with cloud computing by using Microsoft Azure to help you solve technical problems. Azure offers a range of features that make it an attractive option, including automated backup, seamless scaling, and the ability to easily integrate AI into your apps.

When it comes to app development, whether it be in the field of data science, web development, or any other domain, you'll be faced with several challenges. One such challenge is ensuring that your app reaches a wide audience while maintaining optimal performance, regardless of whether it's serving a few users or millions.

Additionally, you want best-in-class security and you also want to be able to monitor the health of your app. You can solve all of these challenges with your own _on-premises_ servers and your own software, but it’s costly and takes many people to manage. By using cloud platforms like Azure, you can address most of these issues so you can focus your efforts on developing new features instead of spending time on configuration or other concerns. In this module, we will explore Microsoft Azure and gain a high-level understanding of its capabilities.
