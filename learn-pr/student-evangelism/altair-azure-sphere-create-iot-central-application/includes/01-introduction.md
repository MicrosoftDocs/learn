Welcome to the cloud-connected Altair 8800 on Azure Sphere learning path. In this module, you'll learn about Azure IoT Central and how to use it to create the IoT Web Portal for the Altair emulator.

## Scenario: Creating an IoT web portal

It is common to build a web portal for your IoT applications and IoT Central makes this simple. IoT Central is a [Low Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-code_development_platform?azure-portal=true), environment you can use to build IoT web portals. When you build an IoT Central application, you describe the data a device sends, along with device interactions, and how you want to view the data in the web portal. IoT Central uses [IoT Plug and Play](/azure/iot-develop/overview-iot-plug-and-play?azure-portal=true) to describe device data, device cloud interactions, and is also used to create default data views.

## What will you learn?

In this module, you'll learn how to create a web portal for the Altair emulator using IoT Central and enable trust between your IoT Central application and Azure Sphere.

## What is the main goal?

This module will focus on creating an IoT Central application and enabling trust between IoT Central and Azure Sphere.
