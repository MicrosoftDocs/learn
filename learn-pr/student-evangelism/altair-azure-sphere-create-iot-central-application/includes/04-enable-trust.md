In this unit, you will learn about enabling trust between your IoT Central application and your Azure Sphere tenant.

## IoT Central and Azure Sphere tenant trust

Once your IoT Central application has been created, you must establish trust between Azure Sphere tenant and your Azure IoT Central application. Trust is established by sharing your Azure Sphere tenant Certificate Authority certificate with your IoT Central application.

With trust established, the devices in your Azure Sphere tenant will be provisioned by your Altair IoT Central application. Trusted certificates are used to sign and secure network traffic between your Azure Sphere and IoT Central.

Perform validation steps by downloading a certificate authority (CA) certificate from the Azure Sphere Security Service and validating it using a code generated by Azure IoT Central. The validation process authenticates your Azure Sphere tenant.
