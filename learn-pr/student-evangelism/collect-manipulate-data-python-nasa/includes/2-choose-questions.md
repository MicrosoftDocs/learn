Data science is an iterative process between the knowledge and understanding of what is today, the data that has been collected, and the questions that are being asked. New questions yield more information and the intention to gather more data. 

The questions that NASA scientists have to ask when a new mission is being planned is "What day in X years will be the least likely day to cause a launch push due to weather?" Furthermore, the days leading up to and of the rocket launch, NASA Scientists are the most critical in asking "Will the weather in this area at this time cause any potential issues for the launch?" To answer these questions, NASA has rocket, weather, and flight experts who create guidelines and models to follow to make a determination. Additionally, they have data from their own sensors and weather balloons, as well as trusted sources such as [NOAA - National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration](https://www.noaa.gov/?azure-portal=true).

In this module, we don't have all of the data or expertise that NASA has on the day of a launch, but we do have simple weather data that is publicly available to leverage. This module will look at:
- Conditions (Cloudy, partly cloudy, fair, rain, thunder, heavy storm)
- Temperature 
- Humidity 
- Wind speed 
- Wind direction
- Precipitation
- Visibility
- Sea Level Pressure

Throughout the rocket launches learning path, you will use artificial intelligence and machine learning to discover weather patterns on days where rocket launches did successfully happen. Using those patterns, you will predict whether a launch is likely to be able to happen given specific weather conditions.

## Additional Challenge

While this module will walk you through a specific way of solving this problem, you're encouraged to pause for a moment here to make predictions and think about other data or questions you might be able to ask related to the safety of rocket launches. 

For example, do you think Temperature is a more important indicator of launch safety than Precipitation?

Could you use [Azure Cognitive Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/cognitive-services?azure-portal=true) to take real-time satellite images and use image classification to determine the types of clouds and therefore the likelihood of a safe launch? 

What ideas do you have?
