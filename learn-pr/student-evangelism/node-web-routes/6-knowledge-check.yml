  questions:
    - content: What is a way to set up middleware? 
      choices:
        - content: Use `app.get(‘/’, () => {})`.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. That's how you would set up a default route for ‘/’. 
        - content: Use `app.use({} => {})`.
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: Correct. Using `use()` is the correct way to set up middleware.
        - content: Use `app.middleware() => {})`.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. There's no method called `middleware()`.
    - content: How would you respond with text content?
      choices:
        - content: Use the `res.text()` method.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. There's no method called `text()` on the response stream.
        - content: Use the `res.send()` method.
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: Correct. This method ensures that what's sent back is of type `text`.
        - content: Use the `req.send()` method.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. Although `send()` is the correct method to use for sending data back, you need to use the response stream (`res`), not the request (`req`).
