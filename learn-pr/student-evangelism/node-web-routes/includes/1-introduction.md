Web APIs enable an application to be reachable by anyone who's using a browser or HTTP-capable client software. Each route enables specific capabilities of the application.

In this module, as an engineer at Tailwind Traders, the fictitious online retailer, you are assigned the job to use Node.js to create a new set of HTTP APIs that lists the products that the retailer sells to enable applications to work with the product data.

Although Node.js has some core capabilities via the HTTP module to create an API, many web frameworks simplify this setup. In particular, Express is used by many developers and has been around for a long time. You can use it to focus on creating the necessary routes to support your applications.

Learn how to create API routes with Node.js and Express by using JavaScript. You'll also learn about the parts of URLs, the components of a route, and how they all work together.
