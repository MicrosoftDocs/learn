In this module, you learned how to organize APIs into sections for different types of data in an application. Using dedicated URLs, you can extend a web app and make data accessible. The content covers the structure of a URL, including its components: scheme, authority, path, query, and fragment. Additionally, you learned about HTTP handlers in Express, which create routes to handle HTTP requests. The code examples show how to handle incoming data through route parameters, query parameters, and request bodies. Understanding these concepts is essential for developing APIs and managing data in web applications.

The main takeaways from this module are:

- Organizing APIs into sections based on data types helps extend a web app and make data easily accessible.
- Understanding the structure of a URL, including its components, is crucial for building effective APIs.
- HTTP handlers in Express enable the creation of routes to handle HTTP requests, allowing for efficient data handling in web applications.
- Limiting the amount of data sent or returned from an API can optimize performance and improve efficiency.
- Using route parameters and query parameters can help request specific records or specify subsets of records, reducing strain on the server and client.
