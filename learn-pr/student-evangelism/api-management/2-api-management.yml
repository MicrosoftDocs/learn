quiz:
  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
    - content: What is one of the main challenges that might make you seek out an API management solution?
      choices:
        - content: Reducing the number of API endpoints to a single endpoint.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. API management solutions aren't about reducing the number of API endpoints but about managing and securing them.
        - content: Scaling, ensuring your API is available and responsive to many clients in different regions.
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: Correct. Your main challenges might be scaling, ensuring your API is available and responsive in different regions.
        - content: Eliminating the need for monitoring API performance.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. You still need to monitor API performance even with an API management solution.
    - content: What is Infrastructure as Code (IaC) used for in managing Azure resources?
      choices:
        - content: Managing your infrastructure using code to easily replicate and trace changes.
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: Correct. Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is used to manage your infrastructure using code to easily replicate and trace changes.
        - content: Creating Azure resources manually through the Azure portal.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. IaC is used to manage your infrastructure using code to easily replicate and trace changes.
        - content: Ensuring that only authorized clients can access your API.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. IaC is used to manage your infrastructure using code to easily replicate and trace changes.
    - content: What is the purpose of a circuit breaker in API management?
      choices:
        - content: To monitor API performance and generate usage reports.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. Circuit breakers are used to prevent an application from repeatedly trying to execute an operation that is likely to fail.
        - content: Prevent repeated failures by temporarily blocking requests to a failing backend.
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: Correct. Circuit breakers are used to prevent an application from repeatedly trying to execute an operation that is likely to fail. 
        - content: Permanently disable a backend service when an error occurs.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. You don't want to disable a backend service permanently but you want to temporarily block requests to a failing backend.
