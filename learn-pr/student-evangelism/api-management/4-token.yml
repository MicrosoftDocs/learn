  questions:
    - content: How does a token limit policy help in managing API usage?
      choices:
        - content: By allowing clients to bypass authentication if they exceed the token limit.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. This is not the purpose of a token limit policy.
        - content: By preventing clients from exceeding a predefined number of tokens, thus controlling API usage.
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: Correct, the idea with a token limit policy is to prevent clients from exceeding a predefined number of tokens. This policy is useful in controlling API usage.
        - content: By ensuring that all tokens are valid for an unlimited period.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. Token limit is about controlling the number of tokens, not the validity period.
    - content: What are some good dimensions to use for a token metric policy in Azure API Management and why?
      choices:
        - content: Token usage by client ID, to monitor and analyze how different clients are utilizing tokens, helping in identifying heavy users and potential misuse.
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: Correct. Token usage by client ID is a good dimension to use for a token metric policy because it helps you monitor and analyze how different clients are utilizing tokens.
        - content: Token encryption method, to ensure that all tokens are encrypted using the same algorithm.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. Token encryption method isn't a good dimension to use for a token metric policy.
        - content: Token expiration date, to automatically renew tokens before they expire.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. Token expiration date isn't a good dimension to use for a token metric policy.
