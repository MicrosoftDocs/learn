  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "What is the purpose of an LLM?"
    choices:
    - content: "To process and produce natural language text by learning from a massive amount of text data to discover patterns and rules of language."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. An LLM processes and produces natural language text by learning from a massive amount of text data to discover patterns and rules of language."
    - content: "To exhibit anthropomorphism and understand emotions."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. An LLM can't exhibit anthropomorphism or understand emotions."
    - content: "To understand language and facts."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. An LLM doesn't understand language or facts."
  - content: "What is the difference between traditional NLP and LLMs?"
    choices:
    - content: "Traditional NLP uses many terabytes of unlabeled data in the foundation model, while LLMs provide a set of labeled data to train the machine-learning model."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Traditional NLP uses a set of labeled data to train the machine-learning model, while LLMs use many terabytes of unlabeled data in the foundation model."
    - content: "Traditional NLP is highly optimized for specific use cases, while LLMs describe in natural language what you want the model to do."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Traditional NLP describes in natural language what you want the model to do, while LLMs are highly optimized for specific use cases."
    - content: "Traditional NLP requires one model per capability, while LLMs use a single model for many natural language use cases."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Traditional NLP requires one model per capability, while LLMs use a single model for many natural language use cases."
  - content: "What is the purpose of tokenization in natural language models?"
    choices:
    - content: "It enables the automation and validation of the creation and teardown of environments to help deliver secure and stable application hosting platforms."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Tokenization allows AI models to generate words that you can't find in any dictionary without having to generate text on a letter-by-letter basis. It represents words as tokens, which can be a single character, a fraction of a word, or an entire word."
    - content: "It generates text on a letter-by-letter basis."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This method could easily result in gibberish."
    - content: "It represents only common words with a single token."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Multiple tokens are needed to represent less common words."
