You might be familiar with AI models that can analyze text, images, or audio. Each of these tasks requires a dedicated model. Large language models (LLMs) provide a new way to approach AI. LLMs are "general purpose" AI models, which means they're good at many things. LLM usage has the potential to improve workflows for people in many different professions.

## Scenario: Evaluating large language models for your tech startup

Imagine you're a student thinking about creating a product that uses AI. You heard about LLMs and you might have experience using a feature like ChatGPT. To determine if this type of AI is right for your product, you need to learn the core concepts of LLMs and understand what scenarios LLMs are good for.

## What will you learn?

In this module, you learn to:

- Explain what an LLM is.
- Describe what LLMs can and can't do.
- Understand core concepts like prompts, tokens, and completions.
- Distinguish between different models to understand which one to choose for what purpose.

## What is the main goal?

Understand LLMs and which one to use for what purpose.
