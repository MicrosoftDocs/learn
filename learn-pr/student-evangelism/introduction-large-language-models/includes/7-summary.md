In this module, you learned what large language models are and how they're more “general purpose” than traditional AI models. LLMs are great to use for various tasks including chat, conversation, image modification, coding, and anomaly detection.

You also learned core concepts like prompts, tokens, and completions.

Finally, you were introduced to different models like gpt-35-turbo, embedding models, and DALL-E. You learned which model to use for what purpose and how to choose the right model for your needs.
