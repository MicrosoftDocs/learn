## Scenario: App developer, creating personal finance apps

Imagine that you've been accepted onto a project for creating personal finance apps.

As you start working with the team, you notice that some of your teammates are struggling. You want to engage more with them and help them, but they aren't receptive to you. Team morale seems to be low. Your team leader wants to work with you so that you can help your teammates open up about their challenges and struggles. You're happy to use this opportunity to learn about EQ and its importance in the technology environment. You're also eager to learn strategies to improve your own EQ so that you can manage your workload and personal struggles more efficiently.
