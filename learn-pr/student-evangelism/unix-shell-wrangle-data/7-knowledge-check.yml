  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:

    - content: "In our current directory, we want to find the three files with the least number of lines. Which command would work?"
      choices:
        - content: "`wc -l * > sort -n > head -n 3`"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. The operator (`>`) is used to redirect output to files."
        - content: "`wc -l * | sort -n | head -n 1-3`"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. The correct syntax for the `head` command is `-n 3`."
        - content: "`wc -l * | sort -n | head -n 3`"
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct. This command will count the lines in a file, sort the output in ascending order (numerical), and display the first three lines."
        - content: "`wc -l * | head -n 3 | sort -n`"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. This command will count the lines in a file, select the first three lines, and sort the output in ascending order (numerical)."
    
    - content: "What will the regular expression `Fr[ea]nc[eh]` match?"
      choices:
        - content: "French, France, Frence, Franch"
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct. The way this regular expression is constructed, it will match misspellings such as Frence and Franch."
        - content: "Frenche, Franceh, Frenceh, Franche"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. The way this regular expression is constructed, it will match only one of the characters in each list at a time."
        - content: "France, French"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. The way this regular expression is constructed, it will match misspellings such as Franch and Frence."
        - content: "Freanceh, Fraenche"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. The way this regular expression is constructed, it will match only one of the characters in each list at a time."
    
    - content: "The `-v` option to the `grep` command inverts pattern matching so that only lines that don't match the pattern are printed. Which of the following commands will find all files in the **/data** directory whose names end in `s.txt`, but whose names also don't contain the string `net`? Examples are `shuttles.txt` or `software.txt`, but not `planets.txt`."
      choices:
        - content: "`find data -name *s.txt | grep -v net`"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. The shell expands `*s.txt` instead of passing the wildcard expression to find."
        - content: "`grep -v 'net' $(find data -name '*s.txt')`"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. This command searches the contents of the files for lines that don't match `net`, rather than searching the file names."
        - content: "`find data -name '*s.txt' | grep -v net`"
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct. Putting the match expression in quotation marks prevents the shell from expanding it, so it gets passed to the find command."
        - content: "None of the above"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. The correct answer is `find data -name '*s.txt' | grep -v net`."

    - content: "Suppose you want to delete some processed data files and only keep your raw files and processing script to save storage. The raw files end in `.dat`, and the processed files end in `.txt`. Which of the following solutions would remove **all** of the processed data files, and no other files?"
      choices:
        - content: "`rm ?.txt`"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. This expression would remove `.txt` files with one-character names."
        - content: "`rm *.txt`"
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct. This expression would remove all the files that end with a `.txt` extension."
        - content: "`rm * .txt`"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. The shell would expand the asterisk (`*`) to match everything in the current directory. This command would try to remove all matched files and an additional file named `.txt`."
        - content: "`rm *.*`"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. The shell would expand `*.*` to match all files with any extension. This command would delete all files."
