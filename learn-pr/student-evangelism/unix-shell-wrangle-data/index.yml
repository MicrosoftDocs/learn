  title: Use the UNIX shell to wrangle log data
  description: |
    Have you ever needed to transform data from one format to another? Transforming data is a common task for developers. Whether you're trying to extract some information from some logs or incoming streams, you'll often need to deal with raw data and transform it before it's usable.
    In this module, you'll learn how to wrangle (transform) data by using the UNIX shell. You'll be introduced to some commonly used tools and to the basics of regular expressions.

title: Use the UNIX shell to wrangle log data
summary: Learn how to use the UNIX shell to wrangle data and inspect data files.
abstract: |
  In this module, you'll learn how to:
  - Do basic file inspection with commands such as `head`, `tail`, `wc`, `less`, and `sort`.
  - Use the `cat` command to create, append, display, and concatenate files.
  - Write and use regex (regular expressions) for text pattern matching.
  - Use the `grep` command to search files, or `stdin` content for pattern matching along with regex.
  - Do basic text transformations on input streams by using `sed` and regex.
  - Use pipes and filters for data wrangling.
prerequisites: |
  - Basic knowledge of the command line and basic shell commands
