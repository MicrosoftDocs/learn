The first step to get noticed will come through your resume. The way you phrase and describe your experiences will decide whether your application is noticed or overlooked. 

Recruiters scan hundreds of resumes daily. Each scan averages only about 10 seconds. Only those resumes that catch the recruiter's attention will be read in full. Therefore, you need to ensure that your resume complies in both format and content to what the recruiters are looking for. Look at the position you are interested in and review its requirements. Ensure you at least have some of those requirements listed in your resume or you might not pass the first scan.

## What to look for in the job description

When you read the description of a role, pay close attention to the technical skills of the role and required soft skills. As you tailor your resume to fit this role, make sure you give examples of using both these types of skills. 

### Tech skills

The employer always list tech skills in two different ways: the tech skills you must have, labeled as minimum requirements, and the preferred skills. 

- *Minimum Requirements for the position*: If you do not meet the minimum requirements, your application will most likely be overlooked. However, this fact should not stop you from applying, as this information will serve as guidance towards what skills you should develop. Remember, **no internship expects an expert**.  If you begin working to gain experience for the minimum requirements, you will most likely meet them by the time you interview.

   > [!NOTE]
   > You shouldn't apply to a job or internship if you completely lack a required skill. However if you have basic level in a skill and work really hard on it, a lot can happen in a matter of weeks and months. Remember, the job you *definitely* won't get is the one for which you don't apply.

- *Technical skills that are listed as 'preferred'*: Preferred skills may not be necessary but having them will give you a head start. List these skills, determine which ones you already have and notate which ones are achievable before interviewing.

### Soft skills

Soft skills are skills that are not technical in nature but are extremely important to succeed as part of a team. Reading a description for a job, it's important to identify what those skills are and demonstrate in your resume that you do have these skills.

It's often difficult to make out what soft skills are required according to a job description. The way to spot these skills  is to look for keywords. Required soft skills such as teamwork and collaboration might be written into a job description:

>  "You will be responsible for driving cross-team collaboration...negotiating design solutions...and will be expected to collaborate with other interns"

Think about times when you showed the above listed skills and mention them in your resume. You might have demonstrated these skills in a school project or student organization.

### Identifying your strengths and skills

Once you have analyzed the job posting's requirements, your next step is to identify your alignment with these requirements.

1. Create two lists from the requirements you gathered, one for technical skills and one for soft skills.
1. Compare the list of technical skills required with the technical skills you possess.
1. Determine where you acquired these skills, and list these sources. These could have come from classes, boot camps, online courses, personal projects, hackathons, and more.
1. Determine any overlaps, such as a project where you acquired and implemented one or more of these technical skills and assign them a priority. 

> Be brief! Resumes are only expected to be one page long for a student, so you will need to choose your most relevant experience.
1. Now, using the list of soft-skills you created, identify which of these skills were used in the higher priority experiences. Make a note to include them in the descriptions you will write.

## Experience as impact

In order to stand out, you must be able to condense your experience into short yet insightful bullet points. However, the descriptions must delve deeper than simply writing what you did, as most people will tend to focus on their duties rather than showing **their impact**. Impact showcases your skills better than statements, and can include both technical and non-technical experiences. With this knowledge in mind, let's explore how to best address your experiences.

### Technical experience

Technical experience will include anything you had an impact on that can be related to technical skills. Examples of this type of experience can include, among many things: 

- personal or class projects
- research positions
- teaching assistant or tutoring positions
- hackathon projects

These activities are attractive to recruiters as they cover where you acquired or how you implemented both technical and soft skills. They also provide the ground for a technical chat in interviews. Therefore, it is very important to have these experiences written in an *efficient*, *eye-catching* way where your *impact* is highlighted.

To illustrate, let's create a scenario with a class project:

Suppose you worked on a Python class project that required bug fixing for a calculator to work correctly. You identified the issues, implemented the fixes and tested before turning it in for grading. You might describe this project thus: 

> Calculator Project - Programming II Class Example University 2020
> - Programmed a calculator program using Python.
> - Fixed bugs that were in the original code

Although this example describes your project and your work on it, it sounds like a basic project and does not help to showcase you as an individual. By rephrasing it focusing on its impact however, the project can seem more interesting and eye-catching:

> Calculator Class Project - Example University 2020
> - *Ensured* the correct functionality of a calculator program by *identifying* **X** bugs utilizing Python Exemption classes and debugging tools, *implementing fixes* and *testing* the program through **Y** test cases.

This statement showcases the impact you had in the project right from the start, as you describe *what* you did (your impact). Next, the statement leads the reader to know *how* you did it, and provided *data (X and Y)* to measure your work. By following a similar template, your bullet points will not only catch the attention of recruiters, but also exemplify how you communicate your impact.

An easy to follow impact template can look like this:

> Achieved (*or any impact-driven action verb*) _____ (*what you achieved*) by doing ____ (*how you achieved it*), measured by ____ (*any number that serves as context for your description. Though not always necessary, it helps bring value to your actions*).

### Non-technical experience

A common misconception when applying to technical internships is that non-technical experience has no value in a resume. Most students believe that companies only care about how good or experienced a candidate is in programming languages, software concepts, data structures or math. However, non-technical experience provides unique ways to showcase who **you** are, a critical aspect to convey when applying for a job.

Luckily, describing a non-technical experience can be similar to describing technical experiences. In fact, the template mentioned above can be used and adapted to non-technical skills:

*You are a member of a gardening club, where you care for some of the plants at the club's nursery, participate in bi-weekly meetings and provide assistance in some of the events held by the club.*

Using the description template we could write some bullet points like so:

> - Maintained the club's nursery by monitoring and caring for **number** different species of plants, in collaboration with **number** members.
> - Managed **number** club activities by attending bi-weekly club meetings, communicating and discussing ideas and scheduling **number** events.
> - Increased event attendance by **number** of attendees by developing the marketing campaigns of the club with a group of **number** members.

These points describe your experience while highlighting your interests as an individual. You emphasize your grasp of collaboration, communication, time management, dependability, and decision-making. Do not take non-technical experience lightly, as it could often help you as much or more than your technical experience when it comes to standing out among other applicants.

### Describing ongoing experiences


Whenever you describe an ongoing experience in your resume, make sure that you write about it with action verbs in present tense. Instead of writing *ensured*, you would write *ensure*; or *develop* instead of *developed*. Even if the task has been already been completed, if the experience is ongoing, the proper etiquette is to keep it in present tense. For any other experience, you should keep using past tense.

## Next Steps

Now that you know how to describe your experiences, the next step is to build your resume.
