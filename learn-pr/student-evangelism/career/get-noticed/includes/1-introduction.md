Welcome to the Career Module on How to Get Noticed! As you begin your search for internships or Full Time jobs, you will notice that there seems to be a LOT of information on how to best prepare for interviews. However, one key element often left forgotten is how to get noticed in the first place. In order for you to land an interview, you need to have been "*screened*" by a recruiter; and this can only happen if you are able to stand out from the rest. Let's jump to a scenario to further illustrate the case: 

## First Contact

You are attending your first Hackathon and as you take a quick break from coding your heart out, you notice company booths at a distance. You have heard of internships from senior peers before and have applied to multiple opportunities in the past, but this time you get to talk to a recruiter or engineer directly. You approach the table and discover that contrary to popular opinion, recruiters and engineers are not extraterrestrial beings, but regular people just like you! How do you make a good impression and stand out from other attendees? You want to make sure that your resume peaks their interest, but most importantly, that you convey who you are as an individual in a very short time-frame.

## What will you learn?

## What is the main goal?
