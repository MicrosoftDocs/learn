You made it to the interview. Congratulations, that means someone looked through your resume and liked what they saw. It most likely also means you passed a phone screening or a take home test. 

You are already a winner. The interview step is a bit stressful but if you've made it thus far you are in a good place. Lets think of this phase as consisting of a _before_, _during_ and _after_. Mastering each of these phases will maximize your chances to land that job.

## Pre-interview, the take home assignment

You might be asked to complete a take home assignment. What's important to consider, when creating such a sample, is that it should, first of all, solve the problem. Most likely you will send the company a link to where they can find your assignment solution on a site such as GitHub. 

> [!TIP]
> If you're not sure about a requirement or how to interpret part of the task, reach out and ask for clarification. In fact, some companies make the task unclear on purpose and want to see if the candidate will reach out. It's seen as a plus if they do.

Your solution should fulfill the following:

- **Well-structured code**. You should divide up the code into a reasonable number of files and components. Nobody wants to see all the code in one file. Think that if someone were to maintain this code, how would they want it structured?
- **Linted**. Linting is the process of ensuring that the code looks the same throughout. Less important than whether you use spaces or tabs to indent code is whether or not it looks consistent. Rely on your tooling to lint for you, to avoid errors. You might not fail the assignment on this factor, but it shows you care.
- **Tested**. It's a huge plus if your code has tests, especially if you have parts of the code that might be tricky. Having tests here can also lead your appraiser to assess you as being a higher-level developer. Usually beginners to software development have more of a focus on getting things to work. Testing, however, is the sign of a more advanced developer. By implementing tests you showcase maturity which can lead to a better offer in the end.
- **Documented**. Instructions on how to run your code are essential, so double-check that your instructions are correct. You might have only one chance for your appraisers to run your code and if they can't, it can end the process.
- **Does it solve the task**. The code should solve the problem at hand.
- **Considerations**. Are there considerations you've made about the assignment, and if so, which ones? If the assignment isn't clearly written, you have to make assumptions and your solution might be accepted even if you hand in code that solves the problem differently than what the interviewers had in mind.
- **The reasoning**. Probably the most important part of the task is explaining how you solved it. Interviewers might ask you that on an on-site interview but if you can provide such an explanation in the submitted task itself it can be really valuable.
 
- **Good-looking GitHub README**. Build and run instructions should be in a well-written README.md file, if you are using GitHub.

### What if time is too tight?

Sometimes you don't have a chance to finish a task in the allotted time. Don't worry, reach out at that point. Most companies are understanding and might give you more time if you explain the circumstances.

> Even if you don't finish the entire task, submit what you have. Usually appraisers want to see your reasoning, rather than a full-blown solution of a task.

## Day before interview

Before your interview, you can do a lot to prepare your mind and body for your test. Practice various exercises but more importantly, take care of yourself. Rest well, exercise, drink plenty of fluids, and eat well. Prepare like you would to win a marathon. After all, you're running a kind of race where the goal is a great future.

## Interview day

You should feel excited on this day! Keep in mind that no one wants to see you fail. After all, the company is looking for someone to hire and you are looking for a job.

Your interviewers should be open to questions and should understand that sometimes you get stuck. Ask for hints if needed; they shouldn't hold that against you. After all, you are under pressure to perform well.

The interviewers should do what they can to make you feel relaxed.

> Ask questions

Ask questions for clarification, since your context isn't their context. You should feel empowered to ask questions: how this code will be used? Can you use a library? Are there other limitations?

> Remember: you've made it already

Interviewing for most companies in person means that you have already passed some bar already by means of a phone screen or take home test, Now the company is interested in knowing who you are. You are presented to your potential future colleagues and might be given a tour of the premises. No matter what happens, you should view your path so far as a success!

## Tech interview

There arer generally two ways that the technical interviews are carried out: whiteboard and a standard interview. These approaches have their pros and cons.

- **Whiteboard**, the interviewee explains to the interviewers how to solve a problem by writing its solution on a whiteboard.
- **Standard interview**, in the standard interview, the interviewers can ask questions on your take home exercise (if you did one) or contextual questions on a programming language or framework to assess your level.

### Whiteboard interview



In this interview you will be standing in front of a whiteboard to explain the solution of a problem. This type of interview is intended is to mimic your every day work life where you and many your colleagues work together to solve a problem. This form of interviewing gives the interviewers a chance to hear your inner thought process. If this form of interview is carried out well, it's a collaborative exercise where interviewers and interviewee work together to solve a problem.

How do I pass such an interview? Generally the more interviews you do, the better you become at it, but here are three tips:

- **Stop and think**. Don't try to solve the problem immediately. Try assessing the problem first.
- **Be verbal**. Explain your line of thinking so the interviewers can see what considerations and assumptions you make. It gives them a chance to both assess you and to correct an unclear instruction.
- **Confidence**. The more certain you come across the better. You might not get it right when solving a problem but you want to avoid coming across that you have no idea. With that said, saying "I don't know" to something is better than saying something nonsensical. Keep in mind that there might be more than one way to solve a problem.


> [!TIP]
> If you get stuck, that's ok. Ask the interviewer for clues. They will most likely try to help. Be sure to listen to the feedback and incorporate that in the solution that you present.

### Standard interview

In a standard interview, you might be given a large task to solve, a bug to fix, or a system to analyze. You usually get a time limit (like an hour) to solve whatever the problem might be.

Another type of interview might be a more relaxed "take home assignment" after which and you might be asked a few theory questions and some questions on your code.
