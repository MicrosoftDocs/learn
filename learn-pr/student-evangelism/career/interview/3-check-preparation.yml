  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
    - content: What's the best way to prepare for an interview at an algorithmic focused company?
      choices:
        - content: Read a book on design patterns
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. While design patterns are an important part of coding, it's better to use a platform like TopCoder to practice known algorithmic problems.
        - content: Do a so-called "code kata"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. Code katas are definitely a good way to practice common problems. Some of the katas are even algorithmic in nature. A better option is a platform like TopCoder or Project Euler. 
        - content: Practice problems on a platform like TopCoder
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: Correct. A platform like TopCoder enables you to practice specific algorithmic problems and usually analyzes your solution's quality.
