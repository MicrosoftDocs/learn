Let's help you determine an idea you want to pursue!

For a productive brainstorming session, take your time on this step to implement practical thinking, listen to your personal motivations and interests, that helps you narrow down to an idea that you'll enjoy working on. 

We'll provide some guiding questions, requiring you to think about what is important to you, your family/friends, community or the world.

## Identify a problem
Take a moment to think about these questions. *(If you already have a rough idea, move to the next step)*

- What are some of the problems that affect what you care about? *(problems that affect your family/friends, community, animals, mother nature etcetera)*
    - Make a list of them to not lose any!
    - Remember, you can merge ideas to make them more appealing and help fulfill your vision. 
       
- Which of these problems affect you the most?

- Is there any existing solution that addresses this problem?

    - If YES, why is the existing solution not effective? What would you do differently?
    
    - If NO, what would you do to address this problem?

- What industry category does your idea fall under? Here are some examples:

    **Industry Categories**

    | Agriculture | E-commerce & Retail | Finance | Healthcare |
    |---|---|---|---|
    | Education | Lifestyle |  Climate Change | Environmental and Sustainability  |
    | Legal Technology |  Real Estate Technology |  Gaming & Entertainment | Information Technology  |

- Who is a typical user of your solution?

*At the least, your idea should contain a problem and an innovative solution.*

## Get inspired!
Need an idea kickstart? Here are some areas to look at for inspiration on impactful ideas

### Society & Community
Take a moment to think about your community and some of the challenges being faced by your neighbors and society. You can watch local news or read local newspapers and articles to understand these local challenges and their scope.

An example of an idea generated from a problem affecting community.

- The rampant human-wildlife conflicts resulted in loss of lives & destruction of property for communities that live close to wildlife conservancies. [Rhions Lab Limited](https://www.rhions.co/) used IoT and AI to track wildlife and send timely alerts to rangers

### Personal Productivity
When you think about your day to day activities, what are some of the tasks that you would rather not do? How to apply the power of Artificial Intelligence to make you more productive?

An example of an idea to help in increasing productivity

- Many people **struggle with managing their time and tasks effectively**, and often feel overwhelmed or stressed by their workload. I want to build an **AI-powered personal assistant app** that helps users plan, prioritize, and execute their tasks based on their goals, preferences, and deadlines. The app can also provide feedback, reminders, and suggestions to help users improve their productivity and well-being.

### Natural disasters & pandemics
Think about some of the natural disasters that have struck in different parts of the world, and how technology can be used to mitigate or prevent.

An example of an idea generated from natural causes
- **Natural disasters such as earthquakes, floods, hurricanes, and wildfires can cause massive damage and loss of lives and are often hard to predict and prepare for**. I'm thinking of creating an **AI-powered early warning system** that can:
  - Monitor
  - Analyze
  - Forecast natural hazards 
- Using various sources of data such as satellite imagery, weather models, social media, and sensors. 
- The system can also alert and advise authorities, communities, and individuals on how to respond and evacuate in an imminent disaster.


## Use the “Brain writing Technique” to find a solution
> [!NOTE]
> It’s important to have a notebook and pencil close by to write down interesting ideas that might pop up in your mind while we are doing these exercises with Microsoft Copilot.

To help you come up with an interesting solution, we'll do a quick training using a technique called “brain writing”. This technique involves writing down your solution ideas on a piece of paper or a sticky note, and then passing it on to another person who will add their own solution or comments. This way, you can generate many solutions in a short time, without interrupting or judging each other. You can also combine or improve the ideas of others and create new connections or perspectives.

To use this technique, you need:
- A clear problem statement or goal
- A timer
- Paper and pens, sticky notes, or whatever works better for you and your team (Sticky Notes, a whiteboard, PowerPoint, Loop, OneNote, etcetera)
- A team *(In case you’re currently working on your own, you can also ask Microsoft Copilot to help in this activity as shown in the solo steps)*

The group steps are:
1. Write down the problem statement or goal on a board or a screen, so everyone can see it.
1. Give each person a piece of paper or a sticky note, and a pen.
1. Set the timer for 3 minutes and ask everyone to write down one solution that addressed the problem. _They can write as much or as little as they want, but they should try to be clear and concise._
1. When the time is up, ask everyone to pass their paper or sticky note to the person on their right (or left, depending on your preference).
1. Set the timer for another 3 minutes, and ask everyone to read the solution they received, and add their own idea or comment below it. They can also modify or improve the original solution if they want.
1. Repeat steps 4 and 5 until everyone gets their own paper or sticky note back, or until you have enough solutions.
1. Collect all the papers or sticky notes, and group them by themes or categories. You can use a board, a table, or a wall to display them.
1. Review and discuss the solutions with the group and select the best ones to move forward.

The solo steps are:
1. Write down the problem statement or goal on a sticky note, so you can visualize your ideas.
1. Set the timer for 3 minutes and start writing all the ideas that pop up in your mind related to the problem. 
1. When the timer is up, share your ideas to Microsoft Copilot Chat and ask it to give you five ideas related to the problem or goal 
1. Continue until you feel that you have enough ideas from Microsoft Copilot and yourself.
1. Collect all the papers and group them by categories. 
1. Review the ideas and select the best ones to move forward.

Draft your idea in rough bullet points. Example

```
- Cases of human wildife conflicts and poaching are rising at an alarming rate
- Existing solutions don't provide realtime data to prevent deaths and destruction of property
- Solution uses IOT and AI to fix this
```
