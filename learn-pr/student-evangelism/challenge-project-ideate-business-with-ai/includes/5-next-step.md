Congratulations!

We're excited to see what you created through this ideation session. This exercise taught some basic prompt creation techniques, highlighted some Microsoft Copilot capabilities, and provided an introduction to the capabilities of Generative AI.

Generative AI (Microsoft Copilot) can be used for:
- Completion
- Transformation
- Conversation
- Summarizing.

With this idea already fleshed out, next step would be for you to execute and bring the idea to reality.

## Things to consider
- Look at the list of required skills generated for this project. If you don't have some of the listed skills, you may consider recruiting a team of project members that can bring the different mix of skillsets.
- Look at the project objectives generated and if there's an area you need to polish your skills on, check out [Microsoft Learn](/training/?WT.mc_id=academic-114397-pablolopes) for short form learning resources across all topics.

ðŸš€ðŸš€Now, check out the [next challenge project](/training/modules/challenge-project-generative-ai-for-prototyping-and-mvp-creation?WT.mc_id=academic-114397-pablolopes) that will give you a guided experience to [sketching out your prototype and building your Minimum Viable Product (MVP)](/training/modules/challenge-project-generative-ai-for-prototyping-and-mvp-creation?WT.mc_id=academic-114397-pablolopes).
