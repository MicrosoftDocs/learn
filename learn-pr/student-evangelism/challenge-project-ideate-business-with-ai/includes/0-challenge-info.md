Ideation is a Design Thinking stage that aims to produce ideas that are innovative, practical, and solves a problem. These ideas in turn inspire the design of new or better solutions/projects/ products

> [!NOTE]
> In this challenge project, you will use Microsoft Copilot for an ideation session and generate a one-slide summary of an idea, ready for implementation. This would be a great challenge project to complete at the beginning of a hackathon ðŸ˜Š

## Learning objectives

In this module, you'll develop the following skills:

- Creativity
- Curiosity
- Critical thinking
- Problem solving

## Prerequisites

This exercise requires you to have access to the text and image generation capabilities of Generative AI.

- Personal account for [Microsoft Copilot](https://copilot.microsoft.com/) and [Copilot Designer](https://copilot.microsoft.com/images/create)

## Alternative Tools

You need Microsoft Copilot to do this exercise. It involves text and image generation. If you donâ€™t have Microsoft Copilot, you can use other tools, but you may need to change some steps. Here are some places where you can find these tools:

- Microsoft Designer at https://designer.microsoft.com/
- ChatGPT at http://openai.com
- Dalle-2 at OpenAI - http://openai.com

You can use other platforms if you would like, just note that the directions are intended for Microsoft Copilot. You may need to adapt a few things specifically when it comes to image creation.
