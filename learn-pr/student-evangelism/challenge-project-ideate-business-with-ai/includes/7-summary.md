## Learnings
Key takeaways from this step:

- **Using Microsoft Copilot to expound on ideas:** we only specified a few bullet points and it did the work to expand that
- **Specifying tone** - we specified a 'business pitch tone'
- **Exclusion** – we clearly outlined what we didn't want it to (don't name or brand the idea)

## Extensions
To explore further, consider trying:
- **Inclusion or Exclusion** – trying to give the most clear guided instructions by specifying what it should or shouldn't include
- **Length or format of response** – our output is a “paragraph”. Explore creating three sentences to see how it might change the output
- Explore providing a few links for it to reference to help you articulate what you are looking for. Augment your prompt with content
