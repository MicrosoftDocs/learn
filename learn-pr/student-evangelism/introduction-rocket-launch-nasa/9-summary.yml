  questions:
  - content: "Computers will always be more accurate than humans at data analysis"
    choices:
    - content: "True, they are purely logical and so cannot make mistakes"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Computers need to be programmed"
    - content: "True, they are able to process significantly more data, faster"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This is true, however this does not mean more accurate"
    - content: "False, they can never understand context and so can't be accurate"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Machine Learning can let them understand context"
