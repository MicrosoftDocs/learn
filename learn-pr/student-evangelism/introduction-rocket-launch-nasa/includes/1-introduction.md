Specifically for launches, NASA collects data from a lot of different sources to help determine if the conditions are safe for a launch. Whether crewed or uncrewed, it's important that the weather conditions are such that the trajectory and speed of the rocket are not disrupted as it attempts to enters and passes through the atmosphere.

There are certain places that are marked as safe for a rocket to enter space, which requires that rockets be launched from specific locations on Earth. Most importantly, entering from as close to the equator as possible is important to increase the likelihood of success. Furthermore, if there is anything off about the launch, it's best to have a large body of water for the rocket to abort to.

Taking all of that into account, a popular launch spot? Cape Canaveral.

Cape Canaveral, Florida, USA is on the East coast of the Florida peninsula in the Southern part of the United States. Near the Caribbean, this area experiences a fair amount of hurricanes, rain storms, and humidity - all factors that could cause issues during a rocket launch. While you might be thinking "just launch from somewhere with no inclimate weather, like San Diego, California, USA, the fact remains that Cape Canaveral is most often the best location within the United States to launch from to maintain the correct trajectory for entering space.

With so many potential factors at play, NASA has to take into account many different data sources to get the most accurate picture of what the rocket will have to endure on it's 100 kilometer (62 mile) journey into space.
