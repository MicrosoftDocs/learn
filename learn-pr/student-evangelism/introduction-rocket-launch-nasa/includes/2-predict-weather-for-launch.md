Planning a launch happens over the course of years, which means NASA has to choose a date/time years before launch. If you've ever seen your local weather person or meteorologist, you might know that predicting weather even the morning of can be difficult.

Since we have begun to gather and analyze large amounts of data, weather predictions have become more accurate over time, even taking into account our changing climate. But with a high-stakes situation, like the launch of a rocket, it isn't simply that the astronauts might get cold because they didn't know they should bring a jacket - choosing the wrong day could be a life-threatening choice.

NASA partners closely with [NOAA - the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration](https://www.noaa.gov/?azure-portal=true) - to predict and analyze weather data. Luckily, NOAA also shares data with the public, so you can start to analyze similar patterns and make similar predictions using their data too.

NOAA gives access to their data in a number of ways. On the [NOAA Data Access page](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/data-access?azure-portal=true)  , you will find [APIs](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface?azure-portal=true) that will give you access through code that you might write. Additionally, you can download data at no cost, or even order hardcopies of come for small fees.

NASA also has their own data that they collect and make publicly available. At [Data.NASA.gov](https://nasa.github.io/data-nasa-gov-frontpage/?azure-portal=true), you can find tens of thousands of datasets. [NASA also provides developer resources](https://data.nasa.gov/stories/s/gk8h-th3y?azure-portal=true) for folks who want to integrate the NASA data into their applications.

With all of this data, and the hundreds of individuals who use their expertise to ensure the best prediction possible, a date is selected and the process for launching begins.
