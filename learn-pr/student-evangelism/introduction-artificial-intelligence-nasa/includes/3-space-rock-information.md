Before we begin learning about how Artificial Intelligence can classify rocks, let's start by learning about the different types of rocks that we will be classifying and see how well *you* do at classifying rocks.

## Types of Rocks

In this lesson we will be classifying rocks into one of two types: Basalt and Crustal.

> [!NOTE]
> These rock types are also found on the Earth, but for this lesson we are only looking at the lunar variants or rocks that are from the moon.

Basalt is the dark rock type that come from ancient volcanic eruptions on the moon. When you look up at the moon and see dark patches you are likely viewing Basalt. Nearly 26% of the near side of the Moon is basalt and only 2% of the far side is basalt. Most basalt in either hemisphere is found in areas of lowest elevation, particularly in the very large impact basins.

Crustal are lighter rocks that form when there is a partial melt of mantle rocks. These rocks are less common than Basalts.

Look carefully at the sample images for each rock type to learn how to classify a new rock that just arrived from Space.

What type of rock do you think this newly arrived rock is?

This new rock that we just received is a Basalt rock. Did you get it right?

Notice how it is very hard to classify this rock because it looks like both a Crustal and Basalt rock. Computers are great at finding the smaller details that the human eye can miss. This is how artificial intelligence can assist us.
