Before we learn the details of how AI can be used to classify rocks, let's start by learning about the different types of rocks that we'll be working with. And, we'll see how well *you* do at classifying rocks.

## Types of rocks

In this lesson, we'll classify photos of rocks into one of two types: basalt and highland (also known as crustal).

> [!NOTE]
> These rock types also are found on Earth, but for this lesson, we are looking only at the lunar variants; that is, rocks that are from the Moon.

Basalt is a dark rock that comes from ancient volcanic eruptions on the Earth's Moon. When you look up at the Moon and see dark spots and patches, you likely are seeing basalt rock on the Moon's surface. Nearly 17% of the near side of the Moon is basalt; only 2% of the far side is basalt. Most basalt in either of the Moon's hemispheres is found in basins or large craters.

Highland rock is lighter than basalt because basalt is made of heavier elements, like iron and magnesium. Highland rock was made when a large magma ocean, which covered the entire Moon as it formed, crystallized. Highland rock is lighter, so it floated to the top of the ocean and became the crust of the Moon.

Look carefully at the sample images for each rock type to learn how to classify a new rock that just arrived from the Moon.

What type of rock do you think this newly arrived rock is?

The new rock is a basalt rock. Did you get it right?

Notice how it's very hard to classify this rock because it looks both like highland and basalt rock. Computers are great at finding the smaller details that the human eye can miss. This is how artificial intelligence can assist us.
