The job of an AI scientist is to teach machines to do the same 3 steps.
Below we will walk through each step for machines:

### Step 0

Import the image data and pre-made libraries that help us process images. We will also have the computer transform the images so they are in a format that it can read.

1. Import Libraries
2. Import data
3. Transform images to matrixes of numbers

### Step 1

Extract features out of images

1. We Explore the Rock Images
2. Extract features such as texture, size, color, and edges

Scientists decide on what features should be used based on their intuition

### Step 2

Make associations between the image features and rock types. This is where computers can be better than humans at picking out minute details because there are so many associations.

1. Build a network capable of keeping track of millions of associations

### Step 3

Predict the rock type for a new rock:

1. Given a new rock image we extract features out of it
2. We use the associations we have learned to decide what type of rock it is
