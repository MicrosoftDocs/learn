Over the course of the project, we will be using the libraries listed below. They are all free and commonly used in real life artificial intelligence projects. Theses are just a few of the many libraries out there that may assist you in creating an artificial intelligence program. You can learn about other common artificial intelligence libraries and what they do [at this website](https://hackernoon.com/top-8-python-libraries-for-machine-learning-and-artificial-intelligence-y08id3031).

## Matplotlib

Matplotlib is primarily used for visualizing data in Python. It can create static, animated and interactive visualizations in Python. This is great for showing off your data in a more visual way.

## NumPy

NumPy, which is short for Numerical Python, is a popular library used for organizing and storing data in Python. NumPy can create structures for holding data called arrays which are similar to lists in which they store a lot of different data. NumPy also has many functions for manipulating data in these arrays.

## PyTorch

PyTorch is a machine learning library that has many built in functions to help accelerate building projects. Basically people have already made a foundational machine learning program and we are modifying it with our data. This saves us a lot of time and means we don't have to be a data science expert to build amazing projects.
