You can use Azure AI services on edge devices in many scenarios.

For example, detecting language from text on an edge device helps you take actions like translation. Using Azure AI services on Azure IoT Edge lets you set up a language detection solution in areas affected by natural disaster.

Imagine you're in an earthquake-affected area and need to coordinate disaster relief. A recent earthquake has devastated the region's infrastructure. You're responsible for managing medical supplies. The region gets medicine from different countries as emergency aid. As the first point of contact, you scan medicine labels to identify the country or region of origin. After you identify the origin, you give the medicine to the right medical staff to check other details on the label. Because you're in a disaster zone, you can't rely on connectivity.

Previously, doctors waited until someone who spoke the language was available. It's often hard to find the right person in a disaster. You want to use an app or service that runs offline if needed. The app identifies the language on medicine labels. With such a device, you create a safer solution and save valuable time. This solution uses Azure AI services for language detection on edge devices as part of the broader *AI for Good* effort in the disaster zone.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you:

- Implement a cognitive service to perform language detection on an edge device
- Describe how the components and services of a solution to deploy a cognitive service on an edge device work together to solve the problem of language detection on an edge device
