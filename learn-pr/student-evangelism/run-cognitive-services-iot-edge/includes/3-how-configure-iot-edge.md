## Overview 

### Setup IoT hub and IoT device

- Create an IoT hub and a virtual Azure IoT Edge device.
- Register the device with the IoT hub.
- Configure the IoT Edge device to connect to the IoT hub.

### Setup Azure AI services

Create an Azure AI services resource that consumes the Text Analytics API.

### Deploy a module to the edge device

- Select the Language Detection module from Azure Marketplace and set your target IoT Edge device to receive the module.
- Configure Azure AI services endpoint and API key for billing information.
- Specify the route for how messages are passed between modules and to Azure IoT Hub. In this case, we specify that all messages from all modules to go directly to the IoT hub.

## Components used for this stage

- **Resource group:** a collection of resources for a solution.
- **IoT hub:** allows communication between your IoT solution and the devices it manages. It connects to the devices with per-device authentication.
- **Device identity:** lives in the cloud. When you create a device identity in the IoT hub, the hub generates a unique device connection string to associate with the physical device.
- **Virtual device as an IoT Edge device**: The runtime can be deployed on devices as small as a Raspberry Pi or as large as an industrial server. Once a device is configured with the IoT Edge runtime, you can start deploying business logic to it from the cloud. In this module, you'll create a virtual device on the cloud. It acts as an IoT Edge device.

## Detailed steps

In the following exercise, you'll complete these steps:

1. Create the resource group
1. Create a virtual device as an IoT Edge device
1. Create an Azure IoT hub
1. Register the IoT Edge device to the IoT hub
1. Configure IoT Edge to connect to the IoT hub

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Before you begin, if you don't have an active Azure subscription, you need to create a free account. You can use a 30-day free trial, or you can create your pay-as-you-go subscription.

After completing this unit, your device will be connected to the IoT hub, and your device will be registered and configured to the IoT hub.
