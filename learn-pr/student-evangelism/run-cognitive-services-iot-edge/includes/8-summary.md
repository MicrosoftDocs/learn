In the scenario we discussed before, you were tasked with developing a solution to detect language from medical labels (text) for use in a disaster zone.

You formulated the solution by deploying a cognitive service (language detection) on an Azure IoT Edge device. The solution allowed you to work in areas with low internet connectivity, optimize time, and improve safety.

In the absence of the solution, you would need to rely on scarce resources that could compromise safety.
