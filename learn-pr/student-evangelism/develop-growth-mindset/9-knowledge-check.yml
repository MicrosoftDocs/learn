        - content: Avoiding asking others for help.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. Asking others for help can be a critical part of the

        - content: Completing tasks correctly the first time you attempt them.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. To learn from an experience, you don't have to complete tasks correctly the first time you attempt them.
    - content: You ask a peer to help you with a section of code. To write the code,
        both of you need to learn new skills. Which of the following responses
        indicate that your peer has a growth mindset?
      choices:
        - content: You should ask someone else. I'm not cut out for that sort of thing.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. Your peer believes that he either has an innate
            ability for the task or he doesn't. His statement indicates that he
            has a fixed mindset.
        - content: I don't know how to do it yet. Let's learn how to do it together.
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: Correct. Your peer knows that he doesn't know how to do it yet, but
            he's sure he can learn. His statement indicates that he
            has a growth mindset.
        - content: I'll never be good at writing code. I tried it once and it didn't work
            out.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. Your peer believes that he'll never be good at coding
            because he tried previously and it didn't go well. His statement
            indicates that he has a fixed mindset.
    - content: Which one of the following statements is true?
      choices:
        - content: Inner dialogue that implies a growth mindset, like "I can do it,"
            means you can't fail.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: There's always opportunity for mistakes and failure. With a growth
            mindset, you recognize that failure is possible as part of the
            learning process. The risk of failure doesn't stop you from trying.
        - content: Inner dialogue that implies a fixed mindset, like "I'll never be
            able to do it," means you should give up. The thought will prevent
            you from completing the activity.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Although giving up is an option, it's not the only option or the best option. Change your inner dialogue to allow for the learning of new skills necessary for the activity.
        - content: Changing your inner dialogue from "I can't do it" to "I can't do it
            yet, but I can learn how" is an example of changing from a fixed to
            a growth mindset.
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: Understanding that you can learn new things is part of a growth
            mindset.
    - content: Which of the following statements is one reason a growth mindset is beneficial in technology?
      choices:
        - content: A growth mindset is beneficial in technology because you're motivated
            to stretch yourself and learn new things. That motivation is crucial in a
            field that's always evolving.
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: Correct. One aspect of growth mindset is the motivation to learn
            rather than to seek approval.
        - content: A growth mindset is beneficial in technology because you can use it to
            find out whether you were meant to be in technology in the first
            place.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. One component of a fixed mindset is the belief that
            you're born with certain abilities or traits and that you can't
            learn new things.
        - content: A growth mindset is beneficial in technology because the field of
            technology is growing and always needs more people.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. Growth mindset refers to your personal growth, not the
            growth of technology.
