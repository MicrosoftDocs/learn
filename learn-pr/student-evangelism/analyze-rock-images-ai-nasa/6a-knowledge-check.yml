quiz:
  questions:
  - content: "What is the purpose of separating data into training and testing groups?"
    choices:
    - content: "To train the model with one portion of the data and test the model with the rest of the data."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! We separate data into training and testing groups so that we can split the data between the two groups."
    - content: "To limit the amount of data the computer has to process at one time, so it can process more efficiently."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The amount of data a computer can process isn't related to why we separate data into training and testing groups."
    - content: "To train the model more quickly."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. How quickly a computer can train a model isn't a factor in separating data into training and testing groups."
  - content: "How do computers view images?"
    choices:
    - content: "By capturing image captions and adding them to an indexed database."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Using only captions would exclude a substantial amount of information about images."
    - content: "By dividing images into four sections and then processing one section at a time."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Computers don't read images by separating into sections."
    - content: "By translating the image into ones and zeros."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! Computers can read image data only by translating the image into a binary format of ones and zeros."
  - content: "How did we clean the data in our AI model?"
    choices:
    - content: "By deleting images that were blurry or off-center."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. We didn't delete any images as part of our data cleanup."
    - content: "By resizing all the images, so they were the same size."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! We cleaned the data by resizing the images, so the computer can work with images that are all the same size."
    - content: "By first using Microsoft Paint to edit some photos."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. We didn't edit photos as part of our data cleanup."
