In the first two modules, you learned about artificial intelligence (AI) and how the technology can be used to enhance a project. Now you can start to create your own program that uses AI.

Installing Python AI libraries is a great first step in creating a rock classification program. The libraries give you a base model that you can train to complete the task at hand.

In this Microsoft Learn module, we'll use Visual Studio Code, Python, and Jupyter Notebook. You'll review code to clean rock images to prepare data for the program. Then we'll look at the code to create and train the AI model.
