Now that you have some background information about artificial intelligence (AI)--what it is, and how you use it, you can start to create your own program that uses AI. Installing Python AI libraries is a great first step in creating a rock classification program. The libraries give you a base model that you can train to complete the task at hand.

In this Microsoft Learn module, you'll use Visual Studio Code, Python, and Jupyter Notebook to add and clean up images of rocks that we'll use to create and train an AI model.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you will:

- Import AI libraries
- Learn how to import data
- Learn how to clean and separate data
- Show the data you imported

## Prerequisites

- Ability to write and run introductory Python programs
- Visual Studio Code, a Python extension, and Jupyter Notebook installed
- [AI libraries](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/introduction-artificial-intelligence-nasa/7-install-ai-libraries?azure-portal=true) installed
