You're a geologist working at NASA. You're responsible for analyzing the different types of rocks found by the Artemis Rover and producing a report. The rover will send a text document of the different types of rocks, which you'll need to parse through. Your friend tells you how the Python programming language can make the task much easier than doing it by hand, and more automated.

In this module, you'll build a simple notebook with Python to complete the task. Along the way, you'll apply a variety of introductory computer science topics. You'll use Visual Studio Code with the Python extension, to run the code and use pre-built functions that will help you complete this exercise.

## Learning objectives

In the units following, you'll learn many computer science topics and use them to create an end-to-end solution. Along the way, you'll learn:

- How to write variables in the context of a program
- How to use prebuilt functions to read data from a text file
- How to create a function and call it in the context of a program
- How to write conditionals and loops in the context of a program

## Prerequisites

- Visual Studio Code installed
- Python extension installed in Visual Studio Code
- Python and Jupyter Notebooks installed
- Knowledge about introductory Python topics
