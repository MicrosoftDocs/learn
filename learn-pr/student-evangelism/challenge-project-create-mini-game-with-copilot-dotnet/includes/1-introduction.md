Creating a minigame can help you practice your programming skills and improve your ability to create console applications in .NET.

In this module, you develop the classic rock, paper, scissors minigame, with the help of GitHub Codespaces and GitHub Copilot. That is, you don't need to worry about configuring the development environment, so you can focus on application development while relying on a code assistant.

## About the challenge

The rock, paper, scissors game is a hand game in which each player chooses one of the three tools. From a programming point of view, this challenge is a nice exercise to practice conditional decisions, iterations, and the use .NET.

The winner of the game is based in three simple rules:

- Rock beats scissors.
- Scissors beat paper.
- Paper beats rock.

By the end of this module, you have a playable mini-game application with GitHub Copilot!

> [!NOTE]
> This is a **_challenge project_** module where you'll complete a project end-to-end based on a specification. This module is designed to be a test of your skills: there are few guidelines and no step-by-step instructions.

> [!TIP]
> GitHub Copilot offers a free tier with **2,000 code autocompletes and 50 chat messages per month**. To get started, open Visual Studio Code, select the GitHub Copilot icon, and then click "Sign in to Use GitHub Copilot for Free". Log in to your GitHub account in the window that will open in the browser. [Learn more](https://gh.io/copilot).

## Learning objectives

In this module, you demonstrate your ability to:
