quiz:
  questions:
  - content: "Which of the following is a characteristic of Azure functions and serverless?"
    choices:
    - content: "You can bring your own containers."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "You deploy and manage containerized applications with Serverless Kubernetes."
    - content: "You can automate your business process."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "You use a serverless engine to build automated workflows to integrate apps and data between cloud services and on-premises systems with Logic apps."
    - content: "You can integrate services using triggers and bindings."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "You can incorporate Azure services into the function and use a trigger to execute your code."
  - content: "Suppose you're responsible for managing the reliability of speech data coming from different kinds of IoT devices connected to IoT Hub. Why is IoT Hub appropriate for this scenario?"
    choices:
    - content: "IoT Hub provides per device identity to each device."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "IoT Hub securely connects the device to the IoT Hub by per-device authentication."
    - content: "IoT Hub tracks events like device creation, device failures and device connections."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "IoT Hub maintains the health of your solution by monitoring events. But this function cannot authenticate a device."
    - content: "IoT Hub is hosted in the cloud."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Cloud hosting does not impact authenticity in itself."
  - content: "Suppose that you’re responsible for implementing AI solutions with IoT device as an event-based function. You want to explore the ability to interact with Cognitive Service. Which would be a better a solution to implement this scenario?"
    choices:
    - content: "You can configure Cognitive Service API key to trigger the function and execute your code."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "You use an API key to	access the Cognitive Service. It doesn’t trigger the function. "
    - content: "You can write a function that can be deployed locally, then run the function by calling Cognitive service API."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "You can only deploy your function and access the Cognitive service in the cloud."
    - content: "You can write your code as an Azure function that is invoked by a trigger and call the Cognitive Service into the function."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "This gives the flexibility for you to interact with your Cognitive Service API."
