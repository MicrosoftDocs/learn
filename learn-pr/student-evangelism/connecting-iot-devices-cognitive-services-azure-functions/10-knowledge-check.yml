quiz:
  questions:
  - content: "How would you describe a function code?"
    choices:
    - content: "A function code is set of interdependent functions that can be executed on the server."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Function code contains a single independent function."
    - content: "A function code is the main content that executes and performs some jobs without any dependency on the server."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "A function code is written to perform one or multiple jobs in your code."
    - content: "A function code is merely code deployed in the local environment to perform a job."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Function code is deployed in the cloud."
  - content: "Suppose that you’re task with deploying a cognitive speech API into your function app. In what order would you perform the following steps to create a speech translation app?"
    choices:
    - content: " Trigger the function - speech recognition - removing speech disfluencies – translation – text to speech"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "You need to trigger the function, recognize the speech,  remove speech disfluencies, translate the text and produce the translated audio."
    - content: "Trigger the function - removing speech disfluencies – translation – text to speech"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "You need to recognize the speech after triggering the function."
    - content: "Speech recognition - removing speech disfluencies – translation - text to speech"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "You need to trigger the function to execute the code"
  - content: "Suppose you want to develop an application using the Cognitive service API in the Azure function. How do you access the Cognitive Service API from your application?"
    choices:
    - content: "You could directly access the Cognitive Service api within Azure function once it establishes the connection."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "You need to generate an API key to connect the application to the Cognitive service API’s and access the service"
    - content: "You'll need to generate an API key each time to make an attempt to connect and access the cognitive service API."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "You need to create an account once, which generates the API key that can be used for the rest of period."
    - content: "You create a Cognitive service account that will generate an API key that can be used to access to service API"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "You do need an API key to access the cognitive service API in the function"
