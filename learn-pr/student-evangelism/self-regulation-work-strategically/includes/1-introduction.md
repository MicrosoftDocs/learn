The ability to strategize problem-solving and learning can help you effectively work through challenges. Use goal orientation to discover your learning motivation. Use self-regulated learning to create, test, evaluate, and refine a plan.

## Scenario: Team leader, cloud-based services

Imagine you're a team leader in an organization that provides cloud-based services. All team members are participating in training that will teach them necessary skills to work on a challenging project. 

But there's a general frustration with the project and the training. Members of your team tell you they feel overwhelmed and disorganized. They don't feel they're making progress with the project, given how much time they've spent on it. One team member doubts his abilities and questions whether he should be on the team. Others aren't participating fully because they're afraid of making mistakes or that their teammates will think they're unprepared or not good at their jobs. Other team members are excited about the training because they want to learn new skills. 

You need to figure out why certain team members are stuck and overwhelmed. You'll then adjust the training to maximize its effectiveness and provide team members with methods to learn effectively and strategically approach the training and project.

In this module, you'll learn about using self-regulation to respond effectively to challenges. You'll also use goal-orientation theory to diagnose what motivates you to learn.

## What will you learn?

After you complete this module, you'll be able to:

- Respond effectively to challenges by using self-regulation, metacognition, and emotional intelligence.
- Solve problems strategically by using self-regulated learning and its three-step iterative process.
- Apply goal orientation to affect motivation and persistence.
- Foster self-regulation and self-regulated learning in others.

## What's the main goal?

After you complete this module, you'll be able to apply self-regulated learning to strategically approach problem-solving. You'll also be able to support self-regulation in others.

## Prerequisites

To get the best learning experience from this module, you should have an open mind and a willingness to learn about the expectations and responsibilities of managing, mentoring, or collaborating with others in a technology workspace or educational environment.
