Your team members need to understand how their individual thoughts and emotions affect their ability to work through challenges. They also need methods to strategically approach training and the project.

## Metacognition and self-regulation

Can you think of a project or challenge where you struggled because you didn't know where to start? Your approach to solve a problem can be as important as the solution to it. When faced with a challenge, take the time to consider *how* you're approaching the problem-solving process.

Strategic problem-solving abilities are necessary for group and individual projects. To regulate your efforts and stay on course, you should use:

- *Metacognition*. You're aware of your thoughts and emotional state.
- *Self-regulation*. You're managing your emotional reactions.
- *Self-regulated learning*. You're using a strategy to plan, iteratively test, evaluate, and refine your work.

### What is metacognition?

Metacognition is your awareness of how you're thinking, learning, or doing something. It's the way you think about thinking. Essentially, it's your understanding of yourself, your thoughts, and your actions. Think of metacognition as a flashlight that you can use to navigate your thoughts. Metacognition has had a profound impact on learning. It's been one of the most researched topics in the learning field for the past 40 years.

### What is self-regulation?

Self-regulation is your ability to control or redirect disruptive emotions and impulses. It enables you to remain calm in challenging situations and respond more effectively. It's an essential skill in managing challenging situations like deadlines and problems during code development or testing. Self-regulating your emotions is a part of emotional intelligence (EQ).

>[!NOTE]
>*Emotional intelligence* is the ability to identify, name, and manage your emotions. You can use your EQ to recognize your own emotional responses to challenges and deadlines, like frustration, anxiety, or panic. After you recognize these feelings, you can work towards calming down and moving forward to a solution.

To learn more about the importance of metacognition and self-regulation, review the following video. It's about three minutes long.

> [!VIDEO https://learn-video.azurefd.net/vod/player?id=77b18a3a-576c-42c9-9cca-30d05ecfccc7]

After you review the video, consider these questions:

- What did you find interesting or surprising about the video?

- What was familiar for you? What did you relate to?

- Can you think of a time when you were working on a problem and got stuck? What happened next? Did you persist or give up?

- Can you think of a time when you used your metacognition to gain more insight into how you were thinking about a project? Did your awareness of how you were thinking about the project help you in any way?

## Approach challenges strategically

When you approach a challenging task, you might not know where to start. Or you might want to give up after your first try because your plans didn't work. But plans rarely work perfectly the first time you try them. Usually, you need to rethink and revise them.

> [!NOTE] 
> A central idea in self-regulation is that you should set realistic expectations when you start a project. Assume that you might not be completely successful on your first attempt and that you might need to revise your plans. Otherwise, you might quit if your plan doesn't work the first time.

One way you can push through a challenging task is to be *strategic* by creating a plan to solve a problem or work on a task. Strategically approaching challenges can help you avoid common learning pitfalls that can make you want to quit a task. These pitfalls include not knowing where to start when faced with a large task and the tendency to give up on a task when you're frustrated.

When you work through a problem or learn something new, having a plan allows you to take control of the problem-solving or learning process. The following sections explain techniques you can use to methodically approach problem solving and learning.

### Use your metacognition

Strategized approaches start with metacognition. Your metacognition is what allows you to be strategic and self-regulate. When you become aware of your thinking and actions, you'll be less likely to quit. You won't waste time trying solutions that aren't working or feel as though you failed. 

> [!TIP]
> Exercise your metacognition by tuning in to your thought processes. Pay attention to any negative or self-defeating internal dialogue and replace it with positive, self-supportive internal dialogue.

 Without metacognition, you're more likely to:

- Haphazardly guess at solutions to problems. 
- Think about your progress in a project based on the hours you spent working on it rather than the actions you took or specific outcomes. 
- Become frustrated or doubt your abilities.
 
For example, if you spend hours on a task and don't get the result you're hoping for, you might conclude that you aren't very good. If you don't understand why these things happen or how you can avoid them in the future, you might get discouraged. You might not continue with the project or even in the field of technology.

### Break down challenges

A large challenge can be overwhelming. Consider breaking large challenges into smaller tasks. This strategy often makes it easier to figure out what went wrong in a process or what your next step should be. You might get help from other people to complete smaller tasks. Also, having smaller tasks to complete often helps sustain motivation. You can celebrate as you complete each task rather than waiting until a project is finished to celebrate its completion.

### Keep a log or record

When faced with a difficult task, you might try approaches arbitrarily, hoping one of them works. This is sometimes referred to as *spinning your wheels*. It means performing an activity without structure or results. Also, you might not keep track of the approaches you try and what worked or didn't. Without knowing what you've already done and whether it was successful, it's difficult to develop a strategized approach.

Keeping a log or a record can help you organize and track your approach to solving a problem. Tracking your progress helps you avoid guessing what a solution is and working for an extended period without recognizing your accomplishments. Make a note or write down the steps you try, including what works and what doesn't. Use your log to review the work you've been doing and recognize the progress you've made. You can also share your log with someone who has experience, like a mentor, colleague, or peer. That person should be able to provide feedback about your approach and advice for what your next steps should be.

>[!TIP]
> One purpose of a log is to have a record you can refer to later. That record is helpful when you're troubleshooting issues. It's also useful for people who tend to judge progress by the time that has passed rather than actual results. With a log, there's an answer to the question "What have I been doing for the last three hours?" It's right there in the log.

### Seek advice

If you're stuck, find out what others have tried. Connect with someone who has more experience and get that person's perspective. The person could be a peer, a teacher, or a mentor. Maybe they'll have some steps you can practice, research, or try differently. Do some research on your own by searching online and reading publications or books.

### Compare where you are now to where you began

Significant goals, like finishing a project, or long-term goals, like becoming a public speaker, are exciting. They can motivate you to take a class, start a new job, and even switch careers. Setting short-term, realistic goals can keep you motivated and on track. Give yourself ample opportunity to celebrate small successes. To accurately assess your progress, don't compare where you are now to your future goals or to the progress of the people around you. Compare where you are *now* with where you were when you *started*.

:::image type="content" source="../media/2-long-term-goals.png" alt-text="Drawing that shows a person thinking of a long-term goal." border="false":::

For example, a young musician might dream of the day she can play her instrument like her idol. To work toward this long-term goal, she learns new music, practices her instrument, and celebrates small improvements in her playing. In other words, she doesn't play her instrument at a professional level *now*, but that doesn’t mean she won’t be able to *someday*.

### Apply an iterative, three-step feedback loop

Use the three-step iterative process called self-regulated learning to test and adjust your plan for solving a problem. The next unit describes this concept.
