| **Cloud expertise** | Does your team have minimal cloud expertise? |
| **Offload processing to IoT Edge devices** | Do you plan to offload processing to edge devices? |
| **Scale** | Do you have millions of IoT assets to manage? |
| **Modeling physical spaces** | Do you need to model a physical spaces using sensors? |
| **Time series data** | Do you have large-scale time-series data? |
| **Secure IoT devices** | Do you need to manage secure devices? |

## Applying the decision criteria
Below we present a guidance summary for choosing an IoT approach to solve your business problems.

## Guidance summary
The Azure IoT product portfolio presents two paths for creating solutions, i.e. PaaS solutions and SaaS solutions. You also have access to the underlying PaaS technologies to develop a granular solution.

If you have an industry-specific problem within a specific vertical, consider a PAAS solution such as Azure IoT solution accelerators. 

If you have fewer device models and predictable scenarios, choose SaaS solutions.

If you want to maintain all aspects of your solution, choose the underlying PaaS technologies such as Azure Sphere, Azure IoT Edge etc.
