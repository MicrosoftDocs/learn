## Establishing causality

In the language developed earlier in the section, you can think of the
people in the S&V houses as the treatment group, and those in the
Lambeth houses at the control group. A crucial element in Snow's
analysis was that the people in the two groups were comparable to each
other, apart from the treatment.

In order to establish whether it was the water supply that was causing
cholera, Snow had to compare two groups that were similar to each other
in all but one aspect---their water supply. Only then would he be able
to ascribe the differences in their outcomes to the water supply. If the
two groups had been different in some other way as well, it would have
been difficult to point the finger at the water supply as the source of
the disease. For example, if the treatment group consisted of factory
workers and the control group did not, then differences between the
outcomes in the two groups could have been due to the water supply, or
to factory work, or both. The final picture would have been much more
fuzzy.

Snow's brilliance lay in identifying two groups that would make his
comparison clear. He had set out to establish a causal relation between
contaminated water and cholera infection, and to a great extent he
succeeded, even though the miasmatists ignored and even ridiculed him.
Snow did not understand the detailed mechanism by which
humans contract cholera. That discovery was made in 1883, when the
German scientist Robert Koch isolated the *Vibrio cholerae*, the
bacterium that enters the human small intestine and causes cholera.

In fact, the *Vibrio cholerae* had been identified in 1854 by Filippo
Pacini in Italy, just about when Snow was analyzing his data in London.
Because of the dominance of the miasmatists in Italy, Pacini's discovery
languished unknown. But by the end of the 1800s, the miasma brigade was
in retreat. Subsequent history has vindicated Pacini and John Snow.
Snow's methods led to the development of the field of *epidemiology*,
which is the study of the spread of diseases.

**Confounding**

Let us now return to more modern times, armed with an important lesson
that we have learned along the way:

**In an observational study, if the treatment and control groups differ
in ways other than the treatment, it is difficult to make conclusions
about causality.**

An underlying difference between the two groups (other than the
treatment) is called a *confounding factor*, because it might confound
you (that is, mess you up) when you try to reach a conclusion.

**Example: coffee and lung cancer.** Studies in the 1960s showed that
coffee drinkers had higher rates of lung cancer than those who did not
drink coffee. Because of this, some people identified coffee as a cause
of lung cancer. But coffee does not cause lung cancer. The analysis
contained a confounding factor---smoking. In those days, coffee drinkers
were also likely to have been smokers, and smoking does cause lung
cancer. Coffee drinking was associated with lung cancer, but it did not
cause the disease.

Confounding factors are common in observational studies. Good studies
take great care to reduce confounding and to account for its effects.

## Observation and visualization: John Snow and the Broad Street pump

One of the most powerful examples of astute observation eventually
leading to the establishment of causality dates back more than 150
years. To get your mind into the right timeframe, try to imagine London
in the 1850s. It was the world's wealthiest city but many of its people
were desperately poor. Charles Dickens, then at the height of his fame,
was writing about their plight. Disease was rife in the poorer parts of
the city, and cholera was among the most feared. It was not yet known
that germs cause disease; the leading theory was that "miasmas" were the
main culprit. Miasmas manifested themselves as bad smells, and were
thought to be invisible poisonous particles arising out of decaying
matter. Parts of London did smell very bad, especially in hot weather.
To protect themselves against infection, those who could afford to held
sweet-smelling things to their noses.

For several years, a doctor by the name of John Snow had been following
the devastating waves of cholera that hit England from time to time. The
disease arrived suddenly and was almost immediately deadly: people died
within a day or two of contracting it, hundreds could die in a week, and
the total death toll in a single wave could reach tens of thousands.
Snow was skeptical of the miasma theory. He had noticed that while
entire households were wiped out by cholera, the people in neighboring
houses sometimes remained unaffected. As they were breathing
the same air---and miasmas---as their neighbors, there was no compelling
association between bad smells and the incidence of cholera.

Snow had also noticed that the onset of the disease almost always
involved vomiting and diarrhea. He therefore believed that the infection
was carried by something people ate or drank, not by the air that they
breathed. His prime suspect was water contaminated by sewage.

At the end of August 1854, cholera struck in the overcrowded Soho
district of London. As the deaths mounted, Snow recorded them
diligently, using a method that went on to become standard in the study
of how diseases spread: *he drew a map*. On a street map of the
district, he recorded the location of each death.

Here is Snow's original map. Each black bar represents one death. When
there are multiple deaths at the same address, the bars corresponding to
those deaths are stacked on top of each other. The black discs mark the
locations of water pumps. The map displays a striking revelation---the
deaths are roughly clustered around the Broad Street pump.

![snow's cholera map](../media/snow-map.jpg)

Snow studied his map carefully and investigated the apparent anomalies.
All of them implicated the Broad Street pump. For example: - There were
deaths in houses that were nearer the Rupert Street pump than the Broad
Street pump. Though the Rupert Street pump was closer as the crow flies,
it was less convenient to get to because of dead ends and the layout of
the streets. The residents in those houses used the Broad Street pump
instead. - There were no deaths in two blocks east of the pump.
That was the location of the Lion Brewery, where the workers drank what
they brewed. If they wanted water, the brewery had its own well. - There
were scattered deaths in houses several blocks away from the Broad
Street pump. Those were children who drank from the Broad Street pump on
their way to school. The pump's water was known to be cool and
refreshing.

The final piece of evidence in support of Snow's theory was provided by
two isolated deaths in the leafy and genteel Hampstead area, far
from Soho. Snow was puzzled by these until he learned that the deceased
were Mrs. Susannah Eley, who had once lived in Broad Street, and her
niece. Mrs. Eley had water from the Broad Street pump delivered to her
in Hampstead every day. She liked its taste.

Later it was discovered that a cesspit that was just a few feet away
from the well of the Broad Street pump had been leaking into the well.
Thus the pump's water was contaminated by sewage from the houses of
cholera victims.

Snow used his map to convince local authorities to remove the handle of
the Broad Street pump. Though the cholera epidemic was already on the
wane when he did so, it is possible that the disabling of the pump
prevented many deaths from future waves of the disease.

The removal of the Broad Street pump handle has become the stuff of
legend. At the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) in Atlanta, when
scientists look for simple answers to questions about epidemics, they
sometimes ask each other, "Where is the handle to this pump?"

Snow's map is one of the earliest and most powerful uses of data
visualization. Disease maps of various kinds are now a standard tool for
tracking epidemics.

**Towards causality**

Though the map gave Snow a strong indication that the cleanliness of the
water supply was the key to controlling cholera, he was still a long way
from a convincing scientific argument that contaminated water was
causing the spread of the disease. To make a more compelling case, he
had to use the method of *comparison*.

Scientists use comparison to identify an association between a treatment
and an outcome. They compare the outcomes of a group of individuals who
got the treatment (the *treatment group*) to the outcomes of a group who
did not (the *control group*). For example, researchers today might
compare the average murder rate in states that have the death penalty
with the average murder rate in states that don't.

If the results are different, that is evidence for an association. To
determine causation, however, even more care is needed.

## Snow's "grand experiment"

Encouraged by what he had learned in Soho, Snow completed a more
thorough analysis. For some time, he had been gathering data on cholera
deaths in an area of London that was served by two water companies. The
Lambeth water company drew its water upriver from where sewage was
discharged into the River Thames. Its water was relatively clean. But
the Southwark and Vauxhall (S&V) company drew its water below the sewage
discharge, and thus its supply was contaminated.

The map below shows the areas served by the two companies. Snow honed in
on the region where the two service areas overlap.

![snow's other map](../media/snow-map2.jpg)

Snow noticed that there was no systematic difference between the people
who were supplied by S&V and those supplied by Lambeth. "Each company
supplies both rich and poor, both large houses and small; there is no
difference either in the condition or occupation of the persons
receiving the water of the different Companies ... there is no
difference whatever in the houses or the people receiving the supply of
the two Water Companies, or in any of the physical conditions with which
they are surrounded ..."

The only difference was in the water supply, "one group being supplied
with water containing the sewage of London, and amongst it, whatever
might have come from the cholera patients, the other group having water
quite free from impurity."

Confident that he would be able to arrive at a clear conclusion, Snow
summarized his data in the table below.

| Supply Area    | Number of Hours | Cholera Deaths | Deaths per 10,000 Houses |
|----------------|-----------------|----------------|--------------------------|
| S&V            | 40,046          | 1,263          | 315                      |
| Lambeth        | 26,107          | 98             | 37                       |
| Rest of London | 256,423         | 1,422          | 59                       |

The numbers pointed accusingly at S&V. The death rate from cholera in
the S&V houses was almost 10 times the rate in the houses supplied by
Lambeth.
