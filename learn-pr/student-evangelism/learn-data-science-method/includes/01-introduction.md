## What is data science?

Data Science is about drawing useful conclusions from large and diverse
data sets through exploration, prediction, and inference. Exploration
involves identifying patterns in information. Prediction involves using
information we know to make informed guesses about values we wish we
knew. Inference involves quantifying our degree of certainty: will the
patterns that we found in our data also appear in new observations? How
accurate are our predictions? Our primary tools for exploration are
visualizations and descriptive statistics, for prediction are machine
learning and optimization, and for inference are statistical tests and
models.

Statistics is a central component of data science because statistics
studies how to make robust conclusions based on incomplete information.
Computing is a central component because programming allows us to apply
analysis techniques to the large and diverse data sets that arise in
real-world applications: not just numbers, but text, images, videos, and
sensor readings. Data science is all of these things, but it is more
than the sum of its parts because of the applications. Through
understanding a particular domain, data scientists learn to ask
appropriate questions about their data and correctly interpret the
answers provided by our inferential and computational tools.

Data are descriptions of the world around us, collected through
observation and stored on computers. Computers enable us to infer
properties of the world from these descriptions. Data science is the
discipline of drawing conclusions from data using computation. There are
three core aspects of effective data analysis: exploration, prediction,
and inference. This text develops a consistent approach to all three,
introducing statistical ideas and fundamental ideas in computer science
concurrently. We focus on a minimal set of core techniques that can be
applied to a vast range of real-world applications. A foundation in data
science requires not only understanding statistical and computational
techniques, but also recognizing how they apply to real scenarios.

For whatever aspect of the world we wish to study---whether it's the
Earth's weather, the world's markets, political polls, or the human
mind---data we collect typically offer an incomplete description of the
subject at hand. A central challenge of data science is to make reliable
conclusions using this partial information.

In this endeavor, we will combine two essential tools: computation and
randomization. For example, we may want to understand climate change
trends using temperature observations. Computers will allow us to use
all available information to draw conclusions. Rather than focusing only
on the average temperature of a region, we will consider the whole range
of temperatures together to construct a more nuanced analysis.
Randomness will allow us to consider the many different ways in which
incomplete information might be completed. Rather than assuming that
temperatures vary in a particular way, we will learn to use randomness
as a way to imagine many possible scenarios that are all consistent with
the data we observe.

Applying this approach requires learning to program a computer, and so
this text interleaves a complete introduction to programming that
assumes no prior knowledge. Readers with programming experience will
find that we cover several topics in computation that do not appear in a
typical introductory computer science curriculum. Data science also
requires careful reasoning about numerical quantities, but this text
does not assume any background in mathematics or statistics beyond basic
algebra. You will find very few equations in this text. Instead,
techniques are described to readers in the same language in which they
are described to the computers that execute them---a programming
language.

## Statistical techniques

The discipline of statistics has long addressed the same fundamental
challenge as data science: how to draw robust conclusions about the
world using incomplete information. One of the most important
contributions of statistics is a consistent and precise vocabulary for
describing the relationship between observations and conclusions. This
text continues in the same tradition, focusing on a set of core
inferential problems from statistics: testing hypotheses, estimating
confidence, and predicting unknown quantities.

Data science extends the field of statistics by taking full advantage of
computing, data visualization, machine learning, optimization, and
access to information. The combination of fast computers and the
Internet gives anyone the ability to access and analyze vast datasets:
millions of news articles, full encyclopedias, databases for any domain,
and massive repositories of music, photos, and video.

Applications to real data sets motivate the statistical techniques that
we describe throughout the text. Real data often do not follow regular
patterns or match standard equations. The interesting variation in real
data can be lost by focusing too much attention on simplistic summaries
such as average values. Computers enable a family of methods based on
resampling that apply to a wide range of different inference problems,
take into account all available information, and require few assumptions
or conditions. Although these techniques have often been reserved for
advanced courses in statistics, their flexibility and simplicity are a
natural fit for data science applications.

## Why data science?

Most important decisions are made with only partial information and
uncertain outcomes. However, the degree of uncertainty for many
decisions can be reduced sharply by access to large data sets and the
computational tools required to analyze them effectively. Data-driven
decision making has already transformed a tremendous breadth of
industries, including finance, advertising, manufacturing, and real
estate. At the same time, a wide range of academic disciplines are
evolving rapidly to incorporate large-scale data analysis into their
theory and practice.

Studying data science enables individuals to bring these techniques to
bear on their work, their scientific endeavors, and their personal
decisions. Critical thinking has long been a hallmark of a rigorous
education, but critiques are often most effective when supported by
data. A critical analysis of any aspect of the world, may it be business
or social science, involves inductive reasoning; conclusions can rarely
been proven outright, but only supported by the available evidence. Data
science provides the means to make precise, reliable, and quantitative
arguments about any set of observations. With unprecedented access to
information and computing, critical thinking about any aspect of the
world that can be measured would be incomplete without effective
inferential techniques.

The world has too many unanswered questions and difficult challenges to
leave this critical reasoning to only a few specialists. All educated
members of society can build the capacity to reason about data. The
tools, techniques, and data sets are all readily available; this text
aims to make them accessible to everyone.
