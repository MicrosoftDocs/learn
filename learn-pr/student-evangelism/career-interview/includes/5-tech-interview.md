The interview step can be a bit stressful, but if you've made it this far, you're in a good place. It means someone looked through your resume and liked what they saw. It most likely also means you passed a phone screening. Congratulations!

This unit give you tips on what to do before and during a *technical* interview, to maximize your chances of landing that job.

To get started, watch this short video about the lessons that one Microsoft employee learned from technical interviews:

## The take-home assignment

You might be asked to complete a take-home assignment, in the form of a code sample that solves a problem. Most likely, you'll send the company a link to where they can find your assignment solution on a site such as GitHub.  

> [!TIP]
> If you're not sure about a requirement or how to interpret part of the task, ask for clarification. In fact, some companies make the task unclear on purpose and want to see if the candidate will reach out.  

Your solution should:

- **Actually solve the problem**. Complete the task that was assigned and show that you can follow instructions.

- **Be well structured**. Divide the code into a reasonable number of files and components. Nobody wants to see all the code in one file. Think about how someone who maintains the code would want it structured.  

- **Be linted**. Linting is the process of ensuring that the code looks the same throughout. Less important than whether you use spaces or tabs to indent code is whether it looks consistent. Rely on your tooling to lint for you, to avoid errors. You might not fail the assignment on this factor, but it shows you care.

- **Be tested**. Beginners in software development tend to focus on getting things to work. By implementing tests, you showcase maturity, which can lead to a better offer. Testing is especially important if parts of the code might be tricky.

- **Be well documented**. Instructions on how to build and run your code are essential, so double-check that your instructions are correct. You might have only one chance for your appraisers to run your code. If they can't, that can end the process. If you're using GitHub, instructions should be in a well-written README.md file.

- **Be well reasoned**. A crucial part of the task is the ability to explain how you solved it. Interviewers might ask you for an explanation during an on-site interview, but submitting one with the task can show initiative.  

- **Account for assumptions**. If the assignment is on the vague side, you must make assumptions. Your solution might be accepted even if you hand in code that solves the problem differently from what the interviewers had in mind.

### What if time is too tight?

Sometimes you won't have a chance to finish a task in the allotted time. Reach out at that point. Most companies are understanding and might give you more time if you explain the circumstances.

> Even if you don't finish the entire task, submit what you have. Appraisers often value seeing your reasoning over seeing a full-blown solution.

## The day before the interview

Before your interview, you can do a lot to prepare your mind and body for your test. Practice coding exercises, but also take care of yourself. Rest well, exercise, drink plenty of fluids, and eat well. Prepare like you would to win a marathon. After all, you're running a kind of race where the goal is a great future.

## Interview day

On the interview day, keep in mind that no one wants to see you fail. The company is looking for someone to hire, and you're looking for a job. You'll meet potential future colleagues and might get a tour of the premises.

### Interview types

There are generally two types of technical interviews: 

- **Whiteboard**. In this interview, you'll stand in front of a whiteboard to explain the solution to a problem. This type of interview is intended to mimic your everyday work, where you and your colleagues collaborate to solve a problem. This form of interviewing gives the interviewers a chance to hear and see your thought process. 

- **Standard**. In a standard interview, you might be given a large task to solve, a bug to fix, or a system to analyze. You usually get a time limit (like an hour) to solve whatever the problem might be. 

Either way, the interviewer might ask questions about a programming language or framework to assess your level. If you did a take-home assignment, expect to answer a few theory questions and some questions about your code.

### Tips

Generally, the more interviews you do, the better you become at it. Here are three tips:

- **Stop and think**. Don't try to solve the problem immediately. Assess the problem first.

- **Be verbal**. Explain your line of thinking so the interviewers can see what considerations and assumptions you make. It gives them a chance to assess you and to correct an unclear instruction.

  You should feel empowered to ask questions for clarification, because your context isn't their context. You might ask: how will this code be used? Can you use a library? Are there other limitations?

  If you get stuck, you can try asking for help.

- **Be confident**. The more certain you come across, the better. You might not get it right when solving a problem, but avoid giving the impression that you have no idea. Still, admitting that you don't know something is better than saying something nonsensical. Keep in mind that there might be more than one way to solve a problem.

> Remember: you've made it already.

The company is interested in knowing who you are. No matter what happens, you should view your path so far as a success!
