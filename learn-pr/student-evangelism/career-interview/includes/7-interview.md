## Culture questions

You'll get questions to see how much of a team player you are. You can think out your answers ahead of time. For example, you might be asked these common questions:

- **What are your strengths and weaknesses?** Strengths are easy to list, but you might wonder whether you really want to reveal your weaknesses to a potential employer.  

  The way to answer this question is to turn a weakness into a strength. Describe a moment where you learned about an area where you could improve and how you grew from the process.   

- **How would you handle a conflict?** This is another question that seems tough at first. Point to a situation in the past that speaks to your ability to listen to other people's perspectives and celebrate diversity of thought, while coming to a favorable resolution.  

- **Do you have any questions for me?** It's easy to think, as a beginner, that you can answer this question by saying that you don't have any questions. In fact, having questions prepared for your interviewer is crucial. It shows enthusiasm and curiosity, which will make you more likely to land the role. Remember, this is also your opportunity to assess whether the company and the role are right for you.

## After the final interview

An elegant thing to do is follow up with your recruiter and interviewers right after the final interview. Send an email and thank them for the opportunity to speak to them. 

A thank-you message keeps the conversation open in case they have more questions. It also gives them a chance to reply with updates or next steps. 

If you aren't selected for the role, ask for feedback to improve your interview skills for future success. The company might come back to you in the future if new positions open up. Everybody remembers a highly qualified and well-prepared candidate.
