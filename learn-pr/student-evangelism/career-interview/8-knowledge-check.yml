  questions:
    - content: What is good interview etiquette?
      choices:
        - content: Have questions prepared to show interest in the company.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. Having questions ready is a good idea because it does show initiative, but it's
            not really about etiquette.
        - content: Send an email after the interview to thank the interviewer.
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: Correct. A thank-you email leaves a good impression and is courteous.
        - content: Sharply disagree with your interviewer.
          explanation: Incorrect. It's fine to disagree with your interviewer in a respectful way. That is, acknowledge their opinion and explain how
            you offer a different perspective. Disagreeing in a disrespectful way will leave a negative impression.
          isCorrect: false
