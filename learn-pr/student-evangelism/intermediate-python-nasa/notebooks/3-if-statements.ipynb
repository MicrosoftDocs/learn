    "\n",
    "The most basic conditional statement is the `if` statement. The `if` statement checks whether a condition is true or not true. If the condition is true, the `if` statement runs the code that's defined inside the statement. If the condition is not true, any code that's defined inside the `if` statement is skipped.\n",

    "- If the temperature is above freezing, the rocket will launch.\n",

    "\n",
    "In Python, the format for an `if` statement is:\n",

    "It's necessary to include the colon `:` at the end of the `if` statement and also to indent each line of code that's defined inside the `if` statement. The indented lines of code will run when the `if` condition evaluates to `True`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following example shows how to use an `if` statement in Python. We use the `if` statement to test whether the count of basalt rocks is 0. If the count is 0, both `print()` statements run and display their output. If the count of rocks is not 0, the first `print()` statement is skipped, and only the second `print()` statement runs."
