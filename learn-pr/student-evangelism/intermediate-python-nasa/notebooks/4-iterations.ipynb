    "The `while` loop is one of two iteration types you'll learn about. In this loop, you must specify a condition first and then include the code that you want the loop to iterate over. The loop first checks if the condition is `True` and if it is, then it looks at the code inside the loop. When the condition becomes `False`, the code in the loop is skipped over and the program continues executing the rest of your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the condition in the loop is `False` to begin with, the code within the loop never executes. During a single loop, the program then goes through the loop and runs the code. Once the code is finished, it looks back at the condition to see if it is still `True`. It's necessary to change the variables in your loop to eventually have a condition that is `False`, or else an infinite loop will occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "As shown in the code below, to write a `while` loop, you must first type `while` and then the condition you'll check before every loop. End the line with a colon and be sure to indent the next line, which will be the actual loop. The code below prints out a countdown for a rocket. As you can see, the countdown variable in the condition section decreases in every loop until it reaches -1, at which point the condition is `False` and the loop ends.\n",
