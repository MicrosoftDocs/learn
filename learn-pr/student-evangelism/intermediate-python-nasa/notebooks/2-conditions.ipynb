    "\n",
    "Conditions are things that need to be met before we change tasks. We can find out if a condition is met by comparing two values. To do this, we use something called logical operators. Logical operators return either `True`, if the statement is true, or `False`, if the statement is false. Remember: `True` and `False` values are called booleans.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if our condition is to check whether the temperature is above freezing (to see if a rocket launch would be delayed), our condition would be `temperature > 32`. This would give us `True` if the temperature is above freezing and `False` if the temperature is at or below freezing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some common logical operators:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Equals: `x == y`\n",
    "- Not Equals: `x != y`\n",
    "- Less than: `x < y`\n",
    "- Less than or equal to: `x <= y`\n",
    "- Greater than: `x > y`\n",
    "- Greater than or equal: `x >= y`\n",
    "\n",
    "Try to play around with some logical operators in Jupyter Notebooks. Notice how the single equal sign and double equal signs have different meanings. The single equal sign assigns a value to a variable, while the double equal sign compares values. This difference is a common gotcha that a beginner programmer can face. \n",
