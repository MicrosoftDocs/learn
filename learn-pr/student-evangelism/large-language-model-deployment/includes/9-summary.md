In this module, you learned about the Azure OpenAI cloud resource, which you must have in order to use an LLM in the cloud. You also practiced the deployment of a specific model you want to use. After a model is deployed on your cloud resource, you're able to use it.

Finally, you learned to verify your deployment by using Azure OpenAI Studio. By testing out different prompts, you not only confirmed the success of your deployment, but also explored some capabilities LLMs can perform without the need for further training.

Key takeaways from this module:

- Azure OpenAI Service is a managed service that provides access to state-of-the-art natural language generative AI models such as ChatGPT and GPT-4 as well as the security and enterprise promise of Azure.
- Accessing these models is easy with the straightforward REST API provided by Azure OpenAI Service.
