Welcome to the learning path for the cloud-connected Altair 8800 on Azure Sphere. In this module, you'll learn how to program the Altair 8800 emulator.

## Scenario: Programming

The Altair emulator is running an open-source Intel 8080 emulator. Layered on the Intel 8080 emulator is Altair BASIC and CP/M.

The Altair emulator can be programmed in two ways:
