Working on a portfolio-worthy project by taking up a well-documented challenge is one of the best ways to demonstrate your skills.

In this training module, you'll build a canvas app and integrate Microsoft Azure AI services. This project provides many learning opportunities as you interact with Microsoft Azure AI services and integrate them with the application you're building.

> [!NOTE]
> This is a **_challenge project_** module where you complete a project based on a specification. The module is designed to test your skills. There are few guidelines and no step-by-step instructions.

## About the challenge

In this project, you use low-code Microsoft Power Apps to build a speech translator app that can be used to address communication barriers in the workplace.

The app uses the Speech service API from Microsoft Azure AI services to recognize the user's speech, convert it to text, and translate the text to the desired language. The app can also speak the translated text and can support multiple languages and dialects.

The challenge project helps you to demonstrate your ability to analyze project requirements and translate them into a solution. You'll also showcase your technical skills in Power Apps and Microsoft Azure AI services.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you'll demonstrate your ability to:

- Create a data model by using Microsoft Dataverse for a Power Apps project.
- Set up a Microsoft Azure AI services resource on Azure.
- Create a Power Apps canvas app based on the specifications provided.
- Integrate and consume Microsoft Azure AI services within Power Apps.
- Use GitHub Copilot as an assistant.

## Prerequisites

- Experience creating custom tables and columns in Dataverse
- Working knowledge of application development using Power Apps
- Basic knowledge of Power Fx
- A Microsoft Azure account
