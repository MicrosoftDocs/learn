Before going straight to building a product, a key step for a startup is to identify which customers the company will try to serve through its products and services. Remember, you can't really have any startup/business without customers. With your idea in mind, think about the needs of your most important users and their attributes including demographics and categorization. Your most important customers could be:

- **A mass market**: Your product considered to serve a wide view of potential users with no specific attributes.
- **A niche market**: Your product is customized for uses with a specialized need and characteristics.
- **Segmented market**: Looking at an existing customer segment, your product is highly customized for a distinguished portion of the customer group.
- **Diverse market**: Your product serve multiple customers with different needs and characteristics.
