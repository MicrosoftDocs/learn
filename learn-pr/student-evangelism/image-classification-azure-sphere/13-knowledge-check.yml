quiz:
  questions:
  - content: "You're tasked with deploying a machine learning model to an IoT Edge device. In this case, how could the process of quantization help your solution?"
    choices:
    - content: "Quantization creates a larger model"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Quantization doesn't create a larger model"
    - content: "Quantization creates a more compact model"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Quantization creates a more compact model"
    - content: "Quantization creates a more accurate model"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Quantization could create a less accurate model"
  - content: "The CIFAR-10 dataset contains sixty thousand 32x32 color images in the 10 classes. For this dataset to be used for classification, which criterion must be fulfilled?"
    choices:
    - content: "CIFAR-10 must be very efficient"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The efficiency of the dataset isn't related to classification"
    - content: "The class must have images of a different resolution in CIFAR-10"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The resolution of the dataset isn't related to classification"
    - content: "The class must exist in CIFAR-10"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "The class must exist in CIFAR-10 if it's to be used for classification"
  - content: "Which of the following is possible due to the use of IoT Edge devices?"
    choices:
    - content: "You can deploy a machine learning model on an IoT Edge device even when the device is offline"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "A machine learning model can be deployed on an IoT Edge device and can be operational even when the device is offline"
    - content: "You can use an IoT Edge device to capture images"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The ability to capture images isn't a characteristic of IoT Edge devices"
    - content: "You can use an IoT Edge device to perform real-time processing"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Real-time processing isn't a characteristic of IoT Edge devices"
