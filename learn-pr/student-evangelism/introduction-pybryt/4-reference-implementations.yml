  questions:
    - content: "To create a reference implementation, what must be passed to the constructor?"
      choices:
        - content: "The name of the reference"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Not quite. The constructor also requires a list of annotations."
        - content: "A list of annotations"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Not quite. The constructor also requires the name of the reference."
        - content: "The name of the reference and a list of annotations"
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct! The constructor requires both as positional arguments."
    - content: "How many reference implementations can you use with PyBryt?"
      choices:

          explanation: "Correct!"
    - content: "How can you test against multiple reference implementations?"
      choices:

          explanation: "Not quite."
