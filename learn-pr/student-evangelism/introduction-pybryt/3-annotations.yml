  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
    - content: "Which type of annotation checks that a specific value is present in the student's memory footprint?"
      choices:
        - content: "Value annotation"
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct! Value annotations check for the presence of specific annotations"
        - content: "Relational annotation"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Not quite. Relational annotations assert conditions between other annotations."
        - content: "Complexity annotation"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Not quite. Complexity annotations check the time complexity of a block of code."
    - content: "Which of the following calls creates a value annotation for a list of values, ignoring the ordering of the list?"
      choices:
        - content: "`pybryt.Value(lst)`"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Not quite. This call will only work if the list is in the same order as in the reference implementation."
        - content: "`pybryt.Value(sorted(lst))`"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Not quite. This call will fail if the list in the memory footprint isn't also sorted."
        - content: "`pybryt.Value(lst, equivalence_fn=lambda l1, l2: sorted(l1) == sorted(l2))`"
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct! This call uses a custom equivalence function to compare the sorted versions of two lists, ignoring the original ordering."
    - content: "What is the default behavior of the collection annotation regarding enforcing the order of its children?"
      choices:
        - content: "Ensure that the satisfying timestamps of its children occur in non-decreasing order"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Not quite"
        - content: "Ensure that the satisfying timestamps of its children occur in non-increasing order"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Not quite"
        - content: "Do not check the order of its children"
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct! The default behavior is not to check the order of the collection's children."
