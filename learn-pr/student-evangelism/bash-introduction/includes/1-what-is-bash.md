Bash is a vital tool for managing Linux machines. The name stands for "Bourne-again shell."

A shell is a program that commands the operating system to perform actions. You type commands into a console and run them directly, or use scripts to run batches of commands. Shells such as PowerShell and Bash give system administrators the power and precision that they need for fine-tuned control over the computers for which they're responsible.

There are other Linux shells, including csh and zsh, but Bash has become Linux's de facto standard. That's because Bash is compatible with Unix's first serious shell, the Bourne shell, also known as sh. Bash incorporates the best features of its predecessors. It also incorporates features of its own, such as built-in commands and the ability to invoke external programs.

One reason for its success is its simplicity. Bash, like the rest of Linux, is based on the Unix design philosophy. As Peter Salus summarized in his book *A Quarter Century of Unix*, three of the "big ideas" embodied in Unix are:

- Programs do one thing and do it well.
- Programs work together.
- Programs use text streams as the universal interface.

The last part is key to understanding how Bash works. In Unix and Linux, everything is a file. That means you can use the same commands without worrying about whether the I/O stream—the input and output—comes from a keyboard, a disk file, a socket, a pipe, or another I/O abstraction.

Let's learn the basics of Bash, starting with the syntax and with commonly used commands such as `ls` and `cat`.
