quiz:
  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:

  - content: "What directory would you switch to if you entered the Bash command `cd .`?"
    choices:
    - content: "My special \"home\" directory"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Recall that `~` (not `.`) refers to your special <b>home</b> directory."
    - content: "The parent directory"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Recall that `..` refers to the parent directory in Bash."
    - content: "The first alphabetical subdirectory"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "`.` is a short-version of a directory name, but not that one."
    - content: "I wouldn't switch directories"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Remember that `.` refers to your current directory. Changing directories (`cd`) to your current directory wouldn't change directories at all!"
