Now that you have all of your data imported and modified to your liking, you can begin to create and train an artificial intelligence model. The libraries you imported will do a lot of the heavy work for you, but you will still have to tell the computer how to train your model so it can make predictions.

In this Microsoft Learn module, you'll use Visual Studio Code, Python and Jupyter Notebooks to create an artificial intelligence model that can identify the type of a rock in an image.

## Learning Objectives

In this module, you will:

- Learn about what neural networks are
- Train an artificial intelligence model
- Test the model by having it classify different space rocks

## Prerequisites

- Ability to write and run introductory Python programs
- Visual Studio Code, Python Extension, and Jupyter Notebooks installed
- Have artificial intelligence libraries installed
