quiz:
  questions:
  - content: "What is a neural network?"
    choices:
    - content: "A computer system that's modeled on the human brain and nervous system."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! A neural network is a computer system that's modeled on the human brain and nervous system."
    - content: "An intricate system of linked computing servers."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A neural network isn't a network of computers or servers."
    - content: "A bundle of software that's installed on a computer."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A neural network isn't software."      
  - content: "What does accuracy in an AI model refer to?"
    choices:
    - content: "The percentage of time a model made an incorrect prediction."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This answer doesn't address the measurement of accuracy."
    - content: "The percentage of time the model made a correct prediction."
      isCorrect: true 
      explanation: "Correct! Accuracy in this context refers to how often the model was correct in its predictions."
    - content: "The number of images you need to train the model for the model to be perfect."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The accuracy of an AI model doesn't refer to the details of testing, only to the success rate of predictions."
  - content: "How can you increase the accuracy of an AI model?"
    choices:
    - content: "By training the model five more times."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Training the model more times won't necessarily increase the accuracy of the model."
    - content: "By reducing the number of epochs."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Reducing the number of epochs during training won't necessarily increase the accuracy of the model."
    - content: "By adding more images and increasing the number of epochs."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! You can increase the accuracy of an AI model by adding more images and epochs when you train the model."
