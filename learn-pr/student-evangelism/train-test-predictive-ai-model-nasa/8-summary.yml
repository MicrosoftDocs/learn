  questions:
  - content: "What is a Neural Network?"
    choices:
    - content: "A computer system that is modeled after the human brain and nervous system"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "This is the definition of a neural network"
    - content: "Giving a computer a brain of its own"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "A neural network is just modeled after a brain not an actual one"
    - content: "Software that we install onto a computer"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This is not what a neural network is"      
  - content: "What does the accuracy of a Artificial Intelligence Model mean?"
    choices:
    - content: "What percentage of time the model made a incorrect prediction"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This is not what accuracy means in our context"
    - content: "What percentage of time the model made a correct prediction"
      isCorrect: true 
      explanation: "This is what accuracy means in our context"
    - content: "How many more images you need to train the model with for it to be perfect"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This is not what accuracy means in our context"
    - content: "What percentage of time the program will run"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The program should run every time."
  - content: "How can you increase the accuracy of an artificial intelligence model?"
    choices:
    - content: "Train the model 3 times instead of 5 times"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This will not necessarily increase accuracy"
    - content: "Decrease the epoch number"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This will not necessarily increase the accuracy"
    - content: "Adding more images and increasing the epoch number"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! This is how to increase accuracy"
    - content: "Decreasing the number of images"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This won't necessarily increase the accuracy"
