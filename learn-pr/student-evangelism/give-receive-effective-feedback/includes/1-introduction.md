Reviewing and providing feedback are important components of the software development lifecycle. It's critical to understand the characteristics of effective feedback so that you can constructively frame input for others and unpack or deconstruct any feedback you receive.

In this module, you'll learn about the impact of providing effective and encouraging feedback, also referred to as wise feedback, in the technical workspace or educational environment. You'll learn about the characteristics of wise feedback, and the dos and don'ts of providing feedback. Finally, you'll learn about the methods of developing qualities that are associated with effective feedback.

## Scenario: You're a developer on a team that's working on a new online strategy game

Imagine that you and a group of developers are working on a prototype for a new online strategy game. As a team, you continuously evaluate the game features and explore opportunities to add additional functionalities. Each team member is responsible for writing the code for a specific feature and then submitting it to another team member for peer review. You have new ideas for the game and want to propose them to the team. However, you notice that some team members are more hesitant about bringing their ideas to the table.

You realize that every individual has a different style of providing and receiving feedback. All group members need to work together so that everyone can overcome their reservations and express their ideas freely. You decide to help the team by providing constructive feedback that encourages other team members to boost their confidence and develop their skills.
