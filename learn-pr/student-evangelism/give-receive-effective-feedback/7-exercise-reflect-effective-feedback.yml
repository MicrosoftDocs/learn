          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct. By starting with what the developer got right, you can reinforce your trust in their coding skills. As a result, they're more likely to be receptive to the corrections that follow."
        - content: "You can help other developers learn by fixing their errors for them."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. By fixing developers' errors for them, you're not helping them learn how to prevent similar errors in the future."

          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. By reassigning someone's task to another team member, you're indicating that you don't trust them to complete the program. This can undermine the personâ€™s self-confidence and adversely affect their growth mindset."
