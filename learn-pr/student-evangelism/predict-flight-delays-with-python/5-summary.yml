  questions:

  - content: "What method is used in Pandas to import a CSV file? Assume pandas was loaded as `import pandas as pd`."
    choices:
    - content: "pd.load_file('file.csv')"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: ""
    - content: "pd.read_file('file.csv')"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "There is no 'load_file' method in pandas."
    - content: "pd.read_csv('file.csv')"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "'read_csv is a convenient way to read CSV files in pandas. For other file types, you can use 'read_table'"

  - content: "What is the purpose of splitting data before training a machine learning model?"
    choices:
    - content: "To not give the model too much data."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The model will give best results with as much data as possible."
    - content: "One part can be used for training and the other can be used to evaluate the model's performance."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "It is always best to train your model on data that the model has never seen before to get the most accurate results."
    - content: "The model doesn't need much data."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The model will give best results with as much data as possible."

  - content: "Assuming you've imported Matplotlib as 'plt', what is the method on Matplotlib that you would use to plot a bar chart?"
    choices:
    - content: "plt.bar(labels, values)"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "The 'bar' method creates the bar chart with the given labels and values."
    - content: "plt.chart(labels, values)"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "There is no 'chart' method on Matplotlib."
    - content: "plt.barchart(labels, values)"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "There is no 'barchart' method on Matplotlib."
