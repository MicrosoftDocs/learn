Over the last 40 years, mobile networks have evolved in parallel to the internet. The next evolution of the mobile network (5G) is more than 100 times faster than the existing networks (4G / LTE). However, 5G is more than faster networks. It represents a fundamental change in architecture. So how can Azure developers take advantage of the new features of 5G to create compelling enterprise applications leveraging their existing knowledge? Azure private MEC enables you to create new services and business models for 5G by creating new enterprise services such as low latency IoT services, live video analytics, so on. 

Suppose you work as a manager tasked with maintaining the safety of patients and staff at a COVID healthcare facility. Specifically, you are also responsible for implementing a rapid response system for COVID-related threats in the facility. Your healthcare facility has decided to invest in new technology to cope with dynamic and unpredictable challenges from COVID coupled with the need for rapid response.

Four situations were identified. In all cases, you should be able to respond rapidly to the risks.
- Monitoring health and safety of people through ensuring social distancing and identifying illness as early as possible
- Capturing data from various health tracking devices for patients, including patient monitors, CT scanners, and blood pressure monitors.
- Capturing data from building safety and quality devices such as air quality and building temperature sensors.
- Ensuring regulatory compliance

You want to combine data from various sensors and process the data either on the cloud or the edge. Use of new networking technologies like 5G help to ensure low latency. You also want to create a consistent interface through the use of Azure private MEC. 

## Learning objectives

In this module, you will:

- Evaluate how 5G technologies combine with Azure private multi-access edge compute (MEC) help to create new solutions for the enterprise
