Before you start the module, you need to set up your virtual environment—some of the units and assignments can be viewed interactively through Jupyter notebooks.

If you aren't interested in viewing the content interactively, feel free to skip the steps below.

### You'll need:

- A Microsoft Azure subscription. If you don't already have one, you can sign up for a free trial at <https://azure.microsoft.com>.
- OR A Microsoft Azure Student subscription. If you don't already have one, you can sign up for an Azure for Student Subscription at <https://azure.microsoft.com/free/students>.
- A Visual Studio Codespaces environment based on the MicrosoftDocs/inferentialthinking code repository. This environment provides a hosted instance of Visual Studio Codespaces, in which you can run the interactive notebooks.

## To set up a Visual Studio Codespaces environment:

1. Open [Visual Studio Codespaces.](https://online.visualstudio.com/environments) in a new browser tab; and if prompted, sign in using the Microsoft account associated with your Azure subscription.

1. If you don't already have a Visual Studio Codespaces billing plan, create one. Then create an environment with the following settings:

    - Environment Name: A name for your environment - for example, `inferentialthinking`
    - Git Repository: MicrosoftDocs/inferentialthinking
    - Instance Type: Standard (Linux) 4 cores, 8 GB RAM
    - Suspend idle environment after: 30 minutes

1. Wait about a minute for the environment to be created.

1. Wait for another minute or so while the environment is set up for you. In the background we're installing some components you'll need for the exercise. You'll see a list of notebook (.ipynb) files will appear in the pane on the left.
