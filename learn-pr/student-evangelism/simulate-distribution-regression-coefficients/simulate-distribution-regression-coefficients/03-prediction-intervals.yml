  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
    - content: 'Which of the following is incorrect?'
      choices:
        - content: 'No matter what the shape of the scatter diagram, the average of the residuals is 0.'
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect.
        - content: 'No matter what the shape of the scatter plot, the SD of the residuals is a fraction of the SD of the response variable.'
          explanation: Incorrect.
          isCorrect: false
        - content: 'No matter what the shape of the scatter plot, correlation between the residuals and the x axis is 0.'
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect.
        - content: 'When we bootstrap a scatter plot, we sample the x and y variables independently.'
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: Correct.
    - content: 'When doing hypothesis testing using confidence intervals, what are we checking for?'
      choices:
        - content: 'If the p value is in the confidence interval.'
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect.
        - content: 'If the observed test statistics is in the confidence interval.'
          explanation: Incorrect.
          isCorrect: false
        - content: 'If the test statistic under the null is in the confidence interval.'
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: Correct. If the test statistic under the null is in the confidence interval, we fail to reject the null.
    - content: 'What should we see in the residual plot of a good linear regression analysis?'
      choices:
        - content: 'A linear pattern in the residuals.'
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect.
        - content: 'A non-linear pattern in the residuals.'
          explanation: Incorrect.
          isCorrect: false
        - content: 'A shapeless cloud of residuals.'
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: Correct. If the linear regression is a good analysis, then all pattern should be picked up by the regression, and the residuals should showcase no pattern.
