Congratulations on finishing this module! We have answered some important fundamental questions about regression in the real world in this module by using statistical and computational concepts we learned in previous modules. Now we know when, why and how we can effectively use a regression model for predictions, even when we're just working with a sample instead of the entire population. 

Here are some of the learning objectives we achieved in this module.

- Learn what is a regression model is.
- Study how to inference for true slope using Bootstrap.
- Understand variability of predictions and usage of Bootstrap prediction intervals.
