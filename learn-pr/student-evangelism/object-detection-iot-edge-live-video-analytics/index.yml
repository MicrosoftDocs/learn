title: "Object detection on Edge devices with Live Video Analytics using YOLO model"
summary: "Use a Live Video Analytics module to deploy a machine learning solution to an IoT Edge device. The solution will process a video feed from cameras and detect objects at the edge using a YOLO model to perform inferencing operations. Check that the solution is successfully deployed and test your solution from a web application."
