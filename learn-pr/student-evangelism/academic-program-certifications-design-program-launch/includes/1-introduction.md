This module focuses on ways to improve a degree program’s marketability and attractiveness to potential applicants by implementing Microsoft Certification. When considering how to market a new program, the program leader works closely with the institution’s marketing team to develop a marketing and branding strategy.

In this module, you examine a case study that shows examples of how the University of Lincoln and Microsoft adopted a co-branding approach. This case study helps educators understand how to showcase the unique selling points of a program that implements Microsoft Certification. It also highlights an institution’s relationship with industry, and the shared goals they might have.

For example, co-branding between the institution and Microsoft can be displayed on program webpages and marketing documents for prospective students. Co-branding strategies are appealing to potential program applicants, because such strategies highlight the value of certification in a degree program and provide examples of potential career pathways.
