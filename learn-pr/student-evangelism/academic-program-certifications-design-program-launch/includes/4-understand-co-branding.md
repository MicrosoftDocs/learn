Co-branding can be part of an engaging marketing strategy for a new program. Co-branding includes the use of Microsoft assets, such as logos. It also includes the use of public-facing course and student case studies on online program pages. The University of Lincoln’s shared goals agreement with Microsoft enabled this approach. You can explore this route for your host institution as well.

The University of Lincoln also uses logos and case studies to emphasize the value of certifications in academic programs. These logos provide at-a-glance visual assets that are used on program pages. Here are two examples of Microsoft certification badges:

Lincoln produced several case studies related to offering certification to degree program students, and involving them in industry-sponsored activities such as Azure challenges. This strategy helps to showcase unique student opportunities. The use of optional co-branding on official degree certificates can also be a useful approach if desired by the institution. In this case, Microsoft branding can be used to recognize the certification courses that were implemented in the degree program.

Microsoft and the University of Lincoln continue to pursue co-branding opportunities through contributions to an [Association for Computing Machinery cloud computing working group](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3437800.3439206?azure-portal=true). Potential applicants see that the program is informed by a global group of academics and industry experts.

## Social media channels

Social media channels are a powerful way to amplify a degree program. Students at the University of Lincoln are encouraged to share their certification achievements online, particularly through digital validation services such as Credly badges. The digital badges Credly provides allow students to share their achievements on social and professional platforms such as Twitter and LinkedIn. This activity allows students to serve as marketing and outreach ambassadors for the program they're enrolled in, and to demonstrate the innovative opportunities students at Lincoln experience. Here's an example of a student sharing a Credly badge on a professional network:

The overall goal of co-branding is to celebrate and amplify the unique selling points of a program implementing certification. Co-branding helps show the benefits of attending a program that has established a shared goal agreement with an industry leader such as Microsoft.
