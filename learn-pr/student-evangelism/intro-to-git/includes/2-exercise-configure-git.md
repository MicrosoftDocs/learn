Before you can create your first repo, you must make sure that Git is installed and configured. Git comes preinstalled with Azure Cloud Shell, so we can use Git in Cloud Shell to the right.

## Configure Git

1. In Cloud Shell, to double-check that Git is installed, type `git --version`:

    ```bash
    git --version
    ```

    [!include[](../../../includes/azure-cloudshell-copy-paste-tip.md)]

1. You should see output that looks something like this example:

    ```output
    git version 2.7.4
    ```

1. To configure Git, you must define some global variables: `user.name` and `user.email`. Both are required for you to make commits.

1. Set your name in Cloud Shell with the following command. Replace `<USER_NAME>` with the user name you want to use.

    ```bash
    git config --global user.name "<USER_NAME>"
    ```

1. Now, use this command to create a `user.email` configuration variable, replacing `<USER_EMAIL>` with your e-mail address:

    ```bash
    git config --global user.email "<USER_EMAIL>"
    ```

1. Run the following command to check that your changes worked:

    ```bash
    git config --list
    ```

1. Confirm that the output includes two lines that are similar to the following example. Your name and e-mail address will be different from what's shown in the example.

    ```output
    user.name=User Name
    user.email=user-name@contoso.com
    ```

## Set up your Git repository

Git works by checking for changes to files within a certain folder. We'll create a folder to serve as our *working tree* (project directory) and let Git know about it, so it can start tracking changes. We tell Git to start tracking changes by initializing a Git repository into that folder.

Start by creating an empty folder for your project, and then initialize a Git repository inside it.

1. Create a folder named *Cats*. This folder will be the project directory, also called the working tree. The project directory is where all files related to your project are stored. In this exercise, it's where your website and the files that create the website and its contents are stored.

    ```bash
    mkdir Cats
    ```

1. Change to the project directory by using the `cd` command:

    ```bash
    cd Cats
    ```

1. Now, initialize your new repository and set the name of the default branch to `main`:

    If you're running Git version 2.28.0 or later, use the following command:

    ```bash
    git init --initial-branch=main
    ```

    Or use the following command:

    ```bash
    git init -b main

    ```

    For earlier versions of Git, use these commands:

    ```bash
    git init
    git checkout -b main

    ```

    After you run the initialize command, you should see output that's similar to this example:

    ```output
    Initialized empty Git repository in /home/<user>/Cats/.git/

    Switched to a new branch 'main'
    ```

1. Now, use a `git status` command to show the status of the working tree:

    ```bash
    git status
    ```

    Git responds with this output, which indicates that `master` is the current branch. (It's also the only branch.) So far, so good.

   ```output
    On branch master

    No commits yet

    nothing to commit (create/copy files and use "git add" to track)        
   ```

1. Use an `ls` command to show the contents of the working tree:

    ```bash
    ls -a
    ```

    Confirm that the directory contains a subdirectory named *.git*. (Using the `-a` option with `ls` is important because Linux normally hides file and directory names that start with a period.) This folder is the Git *repository*â€”the directory in which Git stores metadata and history for the working tree.

    You typically don't do anything with the *.git* directory directly. Git updates the metadata there as the status of the working tree changes to keep track of what's changed in your files. This directory is hands-off for you, but it's incredibly important to Git.

## Get help from Git

Git, like most command-line tools, has a built-in help function that you can use to look up commands and keywords.

1. Type the following command to get help with what you can do with Git:

    ```bash
    git --help
    ```

1. The command displays the following output:

    ```output
    usage: git [--version] [--help] [-C <path>] [-c name=value]
           [--exec-path[=<path>]] [--html-path] [--man-path] [--info-path]
           [-p | --paginate | --no-pager] [--no-replace-objects] [--bare]
           [--git-dir=<path>] [--work-tree=<path>] [--namespace=<name>]
           <command> [<args>]

    These are common Git commands used in various situations:

    start a working area (see also: git help tutorial)
       clone      Clone a repository into a new directory
       init       Create an empty Git repository or reinitialize an existing one

    work on the current change (see also: git help everyday)
       add        Add file contents to the index
       mv         Move or rename a file, a directory, or a symlink
       reset      Reset current HEAD to the specified state
       rm         Remove files from the working tree and from the index

    examine the history and state (see also: git help revisions)
       bisect     Use binary search to find the commit that introduced a bug
       grep       Print lines matching a pattern
       log        Show commit logs
       show       Show various types of objects
       status     Show the working tree status

    grow, mark and tweak your common history
       branch     List, create, or delete branches
       checkout   Switch branches or restore working tree files
       commit     Record changes to the repository
       diff       Show changes between commits, commit and working tree, etc
       merge      Join two or more development histories together
       rebase     Forward-port local commits to the updated upstream head
       tag        Create, list, delete or verify a tag object signed with GPG

    collaborate (see also: git help workflows)
       fetch      Download objects and refs from another repository
       pull       Fetch from and integrate with another repository or a local branch
       push       Update remote refs along with associated objects

    'git help -a' and 'git help -g' list available subcommands and some
    concept guides. See 'git help <command>' or 'git help <concept>'
    to read about a specific subcommand or concept.
    ```

Read through the different options available with Git and note that each command comes with its own help page, for when you start digging deeper. Not all these commands will make sense yet, but some might look familiar if you have experience using a VCS.

In the next lesson, you learn more about the commands you just tried and the basics of Git.
