In this exercise, you learn how to import the *triage and handoff* scenario template in your bot. The triage and handoff scenario extends the built-in symptom checker and transitions the conversations to a live nurse.

## Import the triage and handoff scenario

1. Sign in to the Azure Health Bot management portal.

2. Under **Select a template scenario**, select **Open scenarios template catalog**.

6. You can test the scenario by using Web Chat. Enter your message and follow the flow of the scenario.

7. You can customize the flow by using the conversational, flow control, and advanced functionality elements on the top toolbar of the **Designer** tab. Or you can customize the flow by using code. The relevant code is in JavaScript, so if you're familiar with code, you can select the **Code** tab.

## Manage a scenario

The new template scenario appears on the **Manage** tab under **Scenarios** on the left toolbar.

On the **Scenario Management** page, you can edit the scenario name, description, and ID. You can also disable or delete the scenario. Or you can select the scenario name to open the **Designer** screen.
