The Azure Health Bot service is a cloud platform that empowers developers in healthcare organizations to build and deploy AI-powered virtual health assistants that help them improve processes and services.

As a developer in the IT department of a healthcare organization, you want to build a health bot. This bot triages patient issues with a symptom checker and gives patients chat support from live agents.
