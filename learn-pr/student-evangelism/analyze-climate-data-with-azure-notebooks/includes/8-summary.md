There's much more to do and learn with Azure Notebooks, like integrate with Azure Machine Learning, and connect the notebook to your own Azure compute source. The Azure Notebooks Web site contains several sample notebooks that you can experiment with and learn from. Here are two great examples.

- [Discover Sentiments in Tweets](https://notebooks.azure.com/Microsoft/libraries/samples/html/Discover%20Sentiments%20in%20Tweets.ipynb) performs sentiment analysis on 160,000 tweets, and uses the [word_cloud](https://github.com/amueller/word_cloud) package to generate word clouds from the tweets. 
- [Introduction to Cognitive Toolkit](https://notebooks.azure.com/cntk/libraries/tutorials) is a library of notebooks that demonstrate how to use the [Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit](/cognitive-toolkit/) to build sophisticated machine-learning models. 

Check out the Azure Notebooks home page for additional sample notebooks, and use them to deepen your understanding of Jupyter and sharpen your data-science skills.
