Skillful networking is one of the most important factors in jump-starting your career, yet it's often overlooked. Networking encompasses an array of elements that can be helpful in advancing your career. These elements not only provide opportunities for you to grow and learn, but also to help improve your skills in communication and teamwork.  

There are many approaches to networking, each serving to advance both personal and career growth. Here are a few ideas:

- Discuss topics with your peers.
- Find a mentor by joining a mentorship program.
- Join and attend organizational meetings.
- Become part of your school's clubs.
- Attend tutoring sessions and workshops.
- Participate in a hackathon, and build something you're passionate about.
- Contribute to open-source software.
- Join an interest group, or play a sport with other people.

## Is networking only for in-person situations?

Not at all! Connecting with others online is a well-established and common way to network. For example, try asking or answering questions on forums or collaborating on websites, such as GitHub, or on other types of open-source projects. These virtual activities provide the same learning and professional growth opportunities as any in-person activities.

> A good site for connecting with people is LinkedIn, an online platform for building your professional network, thoughtfully engaging with your peers, and learning new skills.

There are numerous ways to get started with networking. The following sections present just a few of them.

### Be active on Linked In

You can do a lot of networking from your computer. Linked In has a vast network with both technical peers and also the companies you might want to work for one day. It's a good idea to:

- **Reach out**: reach out to people with similar interests and location, they might be your colleagues one day. Start with people you know and then friends of friends.

   > [!TIP]
   > Prefer to send invites to people you've met in real life. Remind people where you've met them, if you saw them speak or do a workshop or similar and you thought they did something well. Genuine compliments will take you far.

- **Join a group of your interest**:, within your field of interest, join a group. Participate in discussions and give compliments if someone posts on a piece of content you've enjoyed.

   > [!TIP]
   > Remember to be respectful, others might not have your context, or they your context. Explain why you have a certain opinion.

- **Share your network with others**:. As you grow your network, share both connections and network tips with others, that's how you grow your network on Linked In.

- **Post about your projects**: If you have a project you've made on GitHub for example, that you find is of good quality, well documented and so on, it's a good idea to write a short article on it and post in on Linked In.

### Join a student organization

Student organizations provide some of the best opportunities for networking. Their members can interact with you as peers and will most likely share common interests with you. Connecting with them and learning about their experiences while also sharing your own is a great first step in networking.

Participating and collaborating in student organizations will help you develop incredibly valuable life skills, such as communication, time management, and teamwork, through service projects, excursions, hackathons, and other events.

### Collaborate in open-source projects that interest you

Open-source software, OSS, is software that you can find on, for example,  GitHub. The idea is that the software is readable, "open", for all. Most such projects are open to collaborators.

Why participate?

- **It's like a real job**. Participating in open-source development is much like having a real job. You work on issues, raise bugs, write documentation and so on. For some people, OSS development is part or their paid job, even if that's a bit unusual.
- **Learn to work in a team** This is your chance to try out collaborative software development in a team, understand what it's like and what skills are needed.
- **Networking**. There's also the added component of being able to network with other participants on that OSS project.

### Participate in hackathons

In a hackathon, you build something in an attempt to solve a problem.  

How does it work? A Hackathon consists of a series of steps that happens in a specific order:

1. **Form a team**. During a hackathon, you form a team around a cause or solution and then build a software-based project over a set period of time.
1. **Build a prototype**. At this point, you and your team try to build a prototype to realize your idea.
1. **Showcase to judges**. Now that you have a prototype, hopefully, it's time to present it. In this part, it's important to talk your idea, and your prototype. Make sure you prepare this part well, it's not always the best tech demo that wins, but the best presented one.

So why is a Hackathon worth your time?

- **Networking**. Hackathons are reliable opportunities to network with peers and meet representatives of interesting companies. Hackathons are often sponsored by companies and company representatives are often in place as mentors or judges. Your conversations might even lead to an interview or an invitation to apply for a job.
- **Learn tech skills**. A hackathon is a great way to push your tech skills with tech.
- **Solve a real problem**. A hackathon differs from a course at University in that you try to solve a problem.
