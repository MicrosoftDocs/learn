While it was great reading about these technologies, a much more exciting way to learn about them is to install them and begin playing around. This unit will teach you how to install Visual Studio Code.

## Installing Visual Studio Code

As mentioned before, Visual Studio Code is free. You can download it [on the Visual Studio Code downloads page](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download). Simply click on the download box according to what operating system you're running (MacOS, Windows, or Linux), then click on the executable file (the grey box at the bottom left of the browser window) once it is done downloading to initiate the installation process.

> [!NOTE]
> The picture below depicts a user using Windows 10 with the Microsoft Edge browser, but you should choose the box that represents your system.

After clicking on the box, you will be asked to accept the license agreement, fill out preferences for the application and be asked where to install. Read over the license agreement and then click agree.

Finally, click install on the final window to finish installation.

## Configuring Visual Studio Code

Once Visual Studio Code is installed, you may have the option to have it open on its own. If you don't see the start dialogue, just find the application on your computer and start it. When you first come into Visual Studio Code, you will be greeted with a welcome window. Let's start by closing this window. You will see on the left side of the screen that there are a variety of icons that you can click on that open other features of Visual Studio Code. Below is a brief overview of a few of the sections that we will be using.

- Explorer: Shows what file(s) you have open and shows the contents of the folder you are in, if you are in one.
- Search: Allows you to look for a certain word or collection of words in your file.
- Source Control: Assists you write/share code with others
- Run: This button will run the code you have written.
- Extensions: This is where you can see all of the additions that people from across the globe have added. There are different color themes, programming languages, and much more. You can install and customize VS Code to however you please.
- Azure: Optional extension that helps integrate Microsoft Azure into Visual Studio Code.
- Docker: Beyond the scope of this lesson.
