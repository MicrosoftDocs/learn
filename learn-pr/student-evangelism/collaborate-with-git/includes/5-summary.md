Congratulations! In this module, you learned how to use Git to collaborate with other developers.

In this module, you learned:

- How to clone a repository
- How to stash changes
- How to push changes to a repo
- What pull requests are and how to initiate a pull request

At this point, you know enough about Git to collaborate in some basic ways, but there's still much more to learn!

If you would like to dig deeper, here are some other resources that you'll find helpful:

- On the command line, run `git help tutorial` and `git help tutorial-2`.
- [Everyday Git](https://git-scm.com/docs/everyday) (also available from the command line, as `git help everyday`).
- GitHub's [Git and GitHub learning resources](https://help.github.com/en/articles/git-and-github-learning-resources).

You also can learn more from the [documentation section](https://git-scm.com/doc) of the [official Git website](https://git-scm.com).
