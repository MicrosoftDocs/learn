Developing a degree program is a challenging task that involves a diverse range of stakeholders and interactions. With a growing need for students to graduate with contemporary digital skill sets, certification can play a key role in degree programs. The role of certification includes alignment with academic learning outcomes to enhance graduate employability and opportunities. 

Maybe you've been involved in the development of a degree program before, or maybe you're just starting out and want to understand more about the role certifications might have in a program of study. Or, maybe you're interested in certification as an extracurricular course opportunity. 

Academic degree programs usually don't offer industry-focused, integrated certifications. Instead, they focus on academic concepts, with appropriate academic assessment. We'll use a case study as a scenario to provide contextualized examples of academic and industry requirements when Microsoft certification is implemented in a degree program.
