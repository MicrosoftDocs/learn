Ensuring that your webpage is accessible to all users and all clients is critical. As Tim Berners-Lee, the creator of the World Wide Web, once said: "The power of the Web is in its universality. Access by everyone regardless of disability is an essential aspect."

As a burgeoning web developer, you believe that learning how to ensure that your pages are accessible early on is important. It's always easier to build a page to be accessible than it is to retrofit it later. If you learn these skills when you first start down the path, they'll become natural. You can then create accessible pages and spot potential pitfalls.

- Tools that users use to browse through webpages.
- Tools that developers use to ensure accessibility.
- Skills for ensuring that your pages are accessible.
