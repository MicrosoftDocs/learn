We're going to create our application iteratively, focusing on specific concepts as we go. To start, we'll create the landing page for our application, which will display the form the user will use.

Typically, the entry point for Flask applications is a file named **app.py**. We're going to follow this convention and create the core of our application. We'll perform the following steps:

1. Create our core application
1. Add the route for our application
1. Create the HTML template for our site
1. Test the application

## Create core application

1. Returning to the instance of Visual Studio Code we were using previously, create a new file named **app.py** by clicking **New file** in the **Explorer** tab

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Screenshot showing the Visual Studio Code New File dialog.](../media/create-file.png)

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > If this exercise is your first time using Visual Studio Code to create a Python application, you'll receive messages about installing the Python extension and the linter **pylint**. Select **Install** to install each of these add-ons.

2. Add the code to create your Flask application

   ```python
   from flask import Flask, redirect, url_for, request, render_template, session

   app = Flask(__name__)
   ```

The import statement includes references to `Flask`, which is the core of any Flask application. We'll use `render_template` in a while, when we want to return our HTML.

`app` will be our core application. We'll use it when we register our routes in the next step.

## Add the route

Our application will use one route - **/**. This route is sometimes called either the **default** or the **index** route, because it's the one that will be used if the user doesn't provide anything beyond the name of the domain or server.

Add the following code to the end of **app.py**

```python
@app.route('/', methods=['GET'])
def index():
    return render_template('index.html')
```

By using `@app.route`, we indicate the route we want to create. The path will be **/**, which is the default route. We indicate this will be used for **GET**. If a **GET** request comes in for **/**, Flask will automatically call the function declared immediately below the decorator, `index` in our case. In the body of `index`, we indicate that we'll return an HTML template named **index.html** to the user.

## Create the HTML template for our form

Jinja, the templating engine for Flask, focuses quite heavily on HTML. As a result, we can use all the existing HTML skills and tools we already have. We're going to use [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com?azure-portal=true) to lay out our page, to make it a little prettier. By using Bootstrap, we'll use different CSS classes on our HTML. If you're not familiar with Bootstrap, you can ignore the classes and focus on the HTML (which is really the important part).

Templates for Flask need to be created in a folder named **templates**, which is fitting. Let's create the folder, the necessary file, and add the HTML.

1. Create a new folder named **templates** by selecting **New Folder** in the **Explorer** tool in Visual Studio Code
2. Select the **templates** folder you created, and select **New File** to add a file to the folder
3. Name the file **index.html**
4. Add the following HTML

    ```html
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
        <link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.0/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet" integrity="sha384-9ndCyUaIbzAi2FUVXJi0CjmCapSmO7SnpJef0486qhLnuZ2cdeRhO02iuK6FUUVM" crossorigin="anonymous">
        <title>Translator</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <div class="container">
            <h1>Translation service</h1>
            <div>Enter the text you wish to translate, choose the language, and click Translate!</div>
            <div>
                <form method="POST">
                    <div class="form-group">
                        <textarea name="text" cols="20" rows="10" class="form-control"></textarea>
                    </div>
                    <div class="form-group">
                        <label for="language">Language:</label>
                        <select name="language" class="form-control">
                            <option value="en">English</option>
                            <option value="it">Italian</option>
                            <option value="ja">Japanese</option>
                            <option value="ru">Russian</option>
                            <option value="de">German</option>
                        </select>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <button type="submit" class="btn btn-success">Translate!</button>
                    </div>
                </form>
            </div>
        </div>
    </body>
    </html>
    ```

The core components in the HTML above are the `textarea` for the text the user wishes to translate, and the dropdown list (`select`), which the user will use to indicate the target language. If you want to add more languages, you can consult the [list of supported languages](/azure/cognitive-services/Translator/language-support?azure-portal=true&WT.mc_id=python-11210-chrhar) for other options. Set the `value` attribute to the language code, for example, **pl** for Polish.

## Test the application

With our initial site created, it's time to test it! We're going to use the integrated terminal inside Visual Studio Code to make our lives a little easier.

1. Open the integrated terminal by selecting **Ctrl-\`** or **Cmd-\`** on a Mac
2. Run the following command to set the Flask runtime to development, which means that the server will automatically reload with every change

    ```bash
    # Windows
    set FLASK_ENV=development
    
    # Linux/macOS
    export FLASK_ENV=development
    ```

3. Run the application!

    ```bash
    flask run
    ```

4. Open the application in a browser by navigating to **http://localhost:5000**

You should see the form displayed! Congratulations!
