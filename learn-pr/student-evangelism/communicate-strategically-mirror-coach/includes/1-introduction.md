You can work with and help your peers in computer science by communicating with them strategically through mirroring and coaching.

In this module, you'll learn about the responsibilities of the mirror and coach roles in technology so that you can determine which role is a better choice in various situations.

## Scenario: Prepare for a hackathon

Imagine that one of your peers has approached you with a request to help some friends who are planning to enroll in an upcoming hackathon. They have some knowledge in coding but want to learn more about the computer science field.

The group of friends wants to enroll in programming courses that they'll pursue in their free time. They're seeking guidance from someone who will help them select the correct courses and also help them with coding as they prepare for the hackathon. Your peer thinks this is a great opportunity for you to practice your leadership skills.

You meet the team and start by helping them select advanced programming courses that will aid them with the hackathon challenge. After you've worked with the team for a few weeks, you've noticed a pattern in your interactions with them.

When people have an assignment due or are trying out a new language, they seek your guidance when they're stuck. At other times, they want you to help them improve their programming skills by giving them small projects and monitoring their progress.

You've been learning more about the mirror and coach roles and want to better understand the differences between these roles. This knowledge will help you guide the team in a way that encourages their own resilience and growth.

## What will you learn?

By the end of this module, you'll be able to:

- Distinguish between mirror and coach roles and how they matter in the workplace.
- Support teamwork by acting as a mirror and a coach.
- Apply and practice key listening skills to improve your understanding of work processes in technology.

## What's the main goal?

By the end of this module, you'll be able to describe the mirror and coach roles and decide when to use each.

## Prerequisites

To get the best learning experience from this module, you should have an open mind and a willingness to learn about the expectations and responsibilities of mentorship in a technology workspace.
