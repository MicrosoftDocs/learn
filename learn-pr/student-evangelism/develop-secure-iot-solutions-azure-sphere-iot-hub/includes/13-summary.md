By using an application built around Azure Sphere, you can securely capture data and send it to the cloud. You first configure the Azure Sphere application to connect to Azure IoT. When you run an application, it connects and transmits data to the cloud. You can monitor the data being sent on Azure IoT. You can send specific commands from Azure IoT Central to the device to control the device parameters. It can also send alert messages to inform the authorized person.

Consider our scenario of monitoring environment parameters such as temperature, air pressure, humidity, and light within a laboratory setting. You want to build and automate a new solution within the lab. This solution will include the sensors deployed in the lab that will record the ambient environmental conditions, and transmit them securely to the cloud.

Without the Azure Sphere-based application, you must manually record these conditions at regular intervals and keep a record of it. And any variation in the lab environment can't be detected in real time.

By using your solution created with Azure Sphere, you can produce accurate and stable results in near real time.
