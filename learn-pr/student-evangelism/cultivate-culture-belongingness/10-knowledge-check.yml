    choices:
    - content: '“I feel respected now that I’ve worked hard to emulate my teammates.”'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'Incorrect. To belong, you shouldn’t need to change yourself to be more like your teammates. Belonging doesn’t require that you change who you are: It requires that you _be_ who you are.'
    - content: '“I don’t share my ideas because my teammates are much better than me.”'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'Incorrect. When you have a sense of belonging in a space, your ideas are considered valuable regardless of your abilities or the abilities of others.'
    - content: '“I feel at home here; it feels like a safe space where I can share my ideas, and I know they’ll be taken seriously.”'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: 'Correct. When you feel that you’re in the right place, or “at home”, you’re sure that your team will actively listen to you and respect you. These factors are all signs that you feel a sense of belonging.'

    choices:
    - content: 'Remind them that they need to be able to use all the tools that the rest of the group is using.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'Incorrect. Aptitude isn’t the same as a sense of belonging.'
    - content: 'Help them learn how to use a tool that is new to them in a way that communicates that you respect them.'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: 'Correct. To have a sense of belongingness in the group, they need to feel respected by the others in the group.'
    - content: 'Because they don’t know how to use a difficult-to-use tool, ask them to assess whether they belong in tech or not.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'Incorrect. Aptitude isn’t the same thing as a sense of belonging.'
  - content: 'A subconscious attitude or stereotype that affects one’s actions, decisions, and understanding of people and events is called what?'
    choices:
    - content: 'Climate.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'Incorrect. Climate is a way of “taking the temperature” of a space.'
    - content: 'Explicit bias.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'Incorrect. Explicit bias is a conscious attitude or stereotype.'
    - content: 'Implicit bias.'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: 'Correct. Implicit bias is a subconscious attitude or stereotype.'
  - content: 'What casual exchange causes a sense of subordination in the recipient?'
    choices:
    - content: 'A chilly climate.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'Incorrect. The result of casual exchanges that cause a sense of subordination in the recipient might be making the climate at work or school seem “cold” and uninviting, even hostile.'
    - content: 'A microaggression.'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: 'Correct. Microaggressions often appear to be a compliment or a joke, but they contain a hidden insult about a group of people based on social identities.'
    - content: 'A micro-affirmation.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'Incorrect. A micro-affirmation is a small act of inclusion that adds up to an overall feeling of inclusion for everyone.'
  - content: 'Four steps to take to build an inclusive environment are:'
    choices:
    - content: 'Invite others to participate, be open to different perspectives, practice active listening, and share the air.'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: 'Correct. These four steps can help build an inclusive environment.'
    - content: 'Practice giving advice to coworkers, have regular meetings about office inclusivity policies, put up motivational posters, and send out weekly emails with ideas for meeting topics on inclusivity.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'Incorrect. Those things might all be good to do, but they’re not the four steps to build an inclusive environment.'
    - content: 'Follow anti-discrimination legislation, have regular meetings about inclusivity and the law, communicate the anti-discrimination policy to staff, and keep the office at a comfortable temperature.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'Incorrect. Although legislation and communication about anti-discrimination are important, in this case “inclusive environment” means people feel welcomed into the space, and feel respected, heard, and valued.'
