## Explore the concept of belonging

Many people wonder, "Am I a tech person? Do I belong here?" Or they might ask themselves, "When do I get to call myself a developer?" Exploring what it means to belong is an essential step on the path to living and learning authentically. Although the tech industry is changing to become more accessible and inclusive, there's still work to be done. There are many factors that contribute to whether people in tech feel they have a place or a sense of belonging.

Typically, people don't contribute fully when they feel they don't belong. To cultivate a climate of belonging in tech, you must proactively include and welcome people from a diverse range of backgrounds and lived experiences. You must also be aware of how your own subconscious biases, words, and actions affect feelings of belonging in others.

*Belonging* is the basic human need to be a part of something larger than ourselves. Psychologists have studied what a "sense of belonging" is for decades. They've concluded that its importance ranks just behind our basic needs like food, shelter, and safety.

Belonging is different than "fitting in" and seeking approval from a group. Fitting in is about assessing a space and becoming who you need to be so that you're accepted in that space. Belonging doesn't require you to change who you are: it only requires you to _be_ who you are.

Belonging is also not your aptitude. Meaning that, it's not about how skilled you are at your job or what kind of grades you have in school. Belonging means:

- Being yourself.
- Perceiving that others value and respect who you are.
- Feeling that you are in the right space for you, which some describe as feeling "at home."

## Belonging

There are many factors that contribute to whether you feel you have a place or a sense of belonging. Your mindset and your sense of self-efficacy influence your sense of belonging. The messages you receive from your environment, including whether you feel respected and valued, largely determine whether you feel you belong.

## Situations that affect your sense of belonging

For many people, the following situations can affect their sense of belonging. Have you experienced any of them? How did you feel when you were:

- Sensing that you needed to be a certain way to fit into your computer science peer group.
- Deciding which companies to approach for a job.
- Preparing for a conversation with an industry professional.
- Finding a study group or project team.
- Answering a question in a group.
- Voicing your concerns on a group project.
- Volunteering to take the lead on a project.
- Wondering whether you belong on a team in response to a peer comment.
- Changing jobs.

## Reflect on feelings of not belonging

Did reading the previous list bring up memories of any specific events in your life when you felt out of place? Think about the situations you just read and about some that came to mind from your own life. Reflect on the ones that made you feel like you didn't belong:

- Did other people do things that contributed to how you felt? Perhaps a leader, your classmates, or peers affected you.

- What impact do you think your feelings had on your ability to learn or work effectively?

- Do you see any predictable patterns for the circumstances that help you feel out of place?

- Did you feel excluded?

Now think of a situation when you felt very comfortable, or where you felt you really connected with others:

- What contributed to your comfort level?

- What did you have in common with the other people in the situation?

- Do you notice any predictable patterns for circumstances that help you feel comfortable?

## Recognize a sense of belonging

How will you know if you or someone in your space has a sense of belonging? Here are some signs that you might not have a sense of belonging in the space you're in:

- You're trying hard to fit in.

- You don't bring up an idea or example of work because it's not what everyone else is doing.

- You don't feel valued or respected by others.

- You don't get an opportunity to share your ideas.

- You don't feel heard because your ideas are brushed off or passed over in meetings, or nobody asks you clarifying or follow-up questions.
