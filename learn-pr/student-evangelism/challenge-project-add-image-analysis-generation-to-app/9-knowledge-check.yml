quiz:
  questions:
  - content: "A developer wants to embed image analysis capabilities into a web application using Image Analysis 4.0 API based on Microsoft Large Foundation model Florence. Which of the following steps should the developer take to achieve this goal?"
    choices:
    - content: "Create a new Azure AI Vision Service resource in the Azure portal, using the 'Computer Vision' service."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The Computer Vision service enables developers to embed image analysis capabilities to their apps."
    - content: "Create a new Azure AI Vision Service resource in the Azure portal, using the 'Face' service."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The Face service enables developers to embed face detection capabilities to their apps."
    - content: Create a new Azure AI Vision Service resource in the Azure portal, using the 'Custom Vision' service."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The Custom Vision service enables developers to build custom image classification models. However, to consume Image Analysis 4.0 API you need to provision a Computer Vision type of resource."
  - content: "A developer needs to store Azure OpenAI service credentials used by the application to call the API in a secure way. Which of the following steps should the developer take to achieve this goal?"
    choices:
    - content: "Use hard-coded values in the application code."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Hard-coded values are not secure and should be avoided."
    - content: "Use environment variables to store the credentials."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Environment variables are name-value pairs that are stored within a specific development environment. They are used to pass configuration information to applications that run in the environment."
    - content: "The most secure option is avoiding storing credentials anywhere and instead authenticate through an access token."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Some Azure AI services - like text translation and speech services - accept access tokens. Azure OpenAI service is not one of them."
  - content: "A developer would like to integrate Azure AI services into a React static web app. Which of the following statements are true?"
    choices:
    - content: "Azure AI services can be integrated by creating a component handling Azure AI service authentication and calls, and then adding it to the 'App.js' file."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Azure AI services can be integrated by creating a component handling Azure AI service authentication and calls and then adding it to the 'App.js' file."
    - content: "It's not possible to integrate Azure AI services into a React static web app."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Azure AI services can be integrated into a React static web app using API or SDKs."
    - content: "Azure AI services can be integrated by creating a component handling Azure AI service authentication and calls, and then adding it to the 'index.html' file."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Azure AI services can be integrated by creating a component handling Azure AI service authentication and calls and then adding it to the 'App.js' file."
