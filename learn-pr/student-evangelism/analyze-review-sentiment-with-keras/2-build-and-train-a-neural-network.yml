quiz:
  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:

  - content: "Based on the first chart you created ('Training and Validation Accuracy'), would you recommend increasing the number of training epochs, decreasing it, or leaving it the same?"
    choices:
    - content: "Increasing the number of training epochs"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The chart shows validation accuracy leveling off after only 2 epochs. Once validation accuracy levels off, a continued increase in training accuracy indicates overfitting. Since we don't want to overfit the model, we wouldn't want to train the model further by adding more epochs."
    - content: "Decreasing the number of training epochs."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Because validation accuracy leveled off after only 2 epochs, we can tell that we need fewer than 5 to get our best (and least overfit) result."
    - content: "Leaving 5 training epochs"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "You can see that the validation accuracy leveled off after only 2 epochs. Once validation accuracy levels off, a continued increase in training accuracy indicates overfitting. Since we don't want to overfit the model, we don't want as many epochs."
