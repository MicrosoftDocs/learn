  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "If you have a pandas DataFrame called <code>samples</code>, what would the output be for <code>samples.head()</code>?"
    choices:
    - content: "The top row of the DataFrame"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Although technically true, the <code>head()</code> function returns more than only the top row."
    - content: "The top five rows of the DataFrame"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct, and if you add a number (for example, <code>head(x)</code>) it would print the top <i>x</i> rows."
    - content: "10 random rows from the DataFrame"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The <code>head()</code> function returns the top five rows (or the number indicated) from a DataFrame, not a random set."
    - content: "The column names of the DataFrame"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Although technically true, the <code>head()</code> function returns more than the column names."
  - content: "In pandas, DataFrame and series are two names for the same kind of data type."
    choices:
    - content: "True"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. DataFrames represent two-dimensional data, like in a table or an Excel worksheet, and series represent one-dimensional data, like a list."
    - content: "False"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. DataFrames and series are different. DataFrames represent two-dimensional data, like in a table or an Excel worksheet, and series represent one-dimensional data, like a list."
  - content: "What is the total weight of the samples that were brought back by the six Apollo missions that landed on the Moon?"
    choices:
    - content: "Over 825 lb, or 375 kg"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Across 2,229 samples, over 800 lb (375 kg) of sample was returned to Earth."
    - content: "Over 63 lb, or 28 kg"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Across the 2,229 samples, a lot more weight was returned."
    - content: "Over 136 lb, or 62 kg"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. 136 lb (62 kg) was the average weight of the samples brought back per Apollo mission."
    - content: "Over 490 lb, or 92 kg"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. 490 lb (92 kg) is how much weight we estimated the three Artemis missions could bring back in total."
