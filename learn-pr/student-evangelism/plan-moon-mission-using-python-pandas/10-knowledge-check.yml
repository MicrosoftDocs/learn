  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "If you have a dataframe called 'samples', what would 'samples.head()' output?"
    choices:
    - content: "The top row of the dataframe"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "While technically true, the 'head()' function returns more than the top row."
    - content: "Ten random rows from the dataframe"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The 'head()' function returns the top rows from a dataframe, not a random set."
    - content: "The column names of the dataframe"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "While technically true, the 'head()' function returns more than the top row."
    - content: "The top five rows of the dataframe"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct, and if you add a number (for example, 'head(x)'') it would print the top x rows."
  - content: "Pandas dataframes and series are two names for the same kind of data type."
    choices:
    - content: "True"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Dataframes represent 2D data, such as a table or an Excel worksheet, and series represent 1D data, such as a list."
    - content: "False"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Dataframes and series are different. Dataframes represent 2D data, such as a table or an Excel worksheet, and series represent 1D data, such as a list."
  - content: "What is the total weight of the samples that were brought back by the six Apollo missions that landed on the Moon?"
    choices:
    - content: "Over 63 lb, or 28 kg"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Across the 2,229 samples, a lot more weight was returned."
    - content: "Over 136 lb, or 62 kg"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This was the average weight of the samples brought back per Apollo mission."
    - content: "Over 490 lb, or 92 kg"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This is how much weight we estimated the three Artemis missions could bring back in total."
    - content: "Over 825 lb, or 375 kg"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Across 2,229 samples, over 800 lb (375 kg) of sample was returned to Earth."
