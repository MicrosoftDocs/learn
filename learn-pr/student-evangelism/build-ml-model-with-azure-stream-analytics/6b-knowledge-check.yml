  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "Which of the following Azure Cloud Shell/Azure CLI commands creates an Azure Storage account?"
    choices:
    - content: "`az group create`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Actually, this Azure CLI command creates an Azure resource group."
    - content: "`az account create`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This command isn't a real Azure CLI command."
    - content: "`az storage account create`"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! This command creates a new storage account."
    - content: "`az storage create`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Close! This command isn't a real Azure CLI command, though."
  - content: "What is the difference between precision and recall when measuring the accuracy of a machine learning model?"
    choices:
    - content: "Precision roughly measures false positives. Recall roughly measures false negatives."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! Technically, precision is (# true positive) / (# true positives + # false positives), and recall is (# true positives) / (# true positives + # false negatives)."
    - content: "Precision roughly measures false negatives. Recall roughly measures false positives."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Not quite!"
    - content: "Precision is a mean of false-positive rates computed across a range of thresholds."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Precision and recall both are slightly simpler than this answer."
    - content: "Recall is a mean of false-positive rates computed across a range of thresholds."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Precision and recall both are slightly simpler than this answer."
  - content: "When deploying a function app in Azure Functions, what's one reason to choose App Service Plan over Consumption Plan?"
    choices:
    - content: "Function apps that are hosted in an App Service Plan support parallel execution. Function apps that are hosted under the Consumption Plan, don't support parallel execution."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "All function types in Azure Functions support parallel execution."
    - content: "App Service Plans that host function apps in Azure Functions don't incur charges."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "All function types in Azure Functions have a charge model, but how does it differ?"
    - content: "Functions that are hosted in an App Service Plan incur charges only when they execute."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Actually, this statement is true of the Consumption model. The App Service model continually runs a compute instance to support your function apps."
    - content: "Function apps that are hosted in an App Service Plan execute immediately when triggered."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "When you use the Consumption model, it might take a few minutes for a machine to run your function app when it's fired. With the App Service plan, the function app runs immediately."
  - content: "When you deploy a SQL database in Azure SQL Database, what's the purpose of adding a client IP address to the security policy?"
    choices:
    - content: "To allow other Azure services to connect to the SQL database."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "We did allow Azure services to connect to the database in this module, but that's not why we added the client IP address."
    - content: "To allow applications running on your computer to connect to the database."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! Your client IP is the IP address of your own computer. Adding it to the database security rules allows your computer to connect to it."
    - content: "To make Microsoft aware of your computer's IP address for Windows updates."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "It does make the database (not Microsoft) aware of your computer's IP address, but not for updates."
  - content: "Power BI Desktop runs on which of the following operating systems?"
    choices:
    - content: "Windows only"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! Power BI Desktop runs only on Windows, but you can view Power BI reports on any platform."
    - content: "Windows and macOS"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Power BI Desktop runs only on Windows, but you can view Power BI reports on any platform."
    - content: "Windows, macOS, and Linux"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Power BI Desktop runs only on Windows, but you can view Power BI reports on any platform."
    - content: "macOS and Linux"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Power BI Desktop runs only on Windows, but you can view Power BI reports on any platform."
