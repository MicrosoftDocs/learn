In this module, you learned that Polyglot Notebooks give us the ability to write code in several languages. With amazing features like variable sharing, magic commands, and the ability to render flowcharts via Mermaid, Polyglot Notebooks also allow you to build full-stack solutions.

You also installed the Polyglot Notebooks extension on Visual Studio Code, created a Notebook using the *Polyglot Notebook: Create new blank notebook* command, shared variables between code cells, and rendered flowcharts with Mermaid.
