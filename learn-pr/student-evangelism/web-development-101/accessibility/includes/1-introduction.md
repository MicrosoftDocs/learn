Ensuring your page is accessible to all users and all clients is critical. As Tim Berners-Lee, the creator of the World Wide Web, once said, "The power of the Web is in its universality. Access by everyone regardless of disability is an essential aspect."

As a burgeoning web developer, learning how to ensure your pages are accessible early on is important. It's always easier to build a page to be accessible than it is to retrofit it later. If you learn these skills when you first start down the path they will become natural, allowing you to create accessible pages and spot potential pitfalls.

- Tools users use to navigate web pages.
- Tools developers use to ensure accessibility.
