    - content: "Certification Authority Web Enrollment"
      isCorrect: false

    choices:

    - content: "Automatic approval of certificate requests"
      isCorrect: true

    - content: "You can configure it as offline root CA"
      isCorrect: false

    choices:
    - content: "You must configure a policy CA."
