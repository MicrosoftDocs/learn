      explanation: "That's incorrect. Configurations are declarative PowerShell scripts that configure and define your resources."
    - content: "LCM"

      explanation: "That's correct. The LCM is the engine that DSC uses to apply the configurations."

    choices:
    - content: "Components"

  - content: "When using Windows Admin Center, when might an administrator choose to configure trusted hosts?"
    choices:
    - content: "When the Windows Admin Center workstation is not in the same AD DS forest as the resources it manages."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. When you connect to a remote computer, you must authenticate to that computer. Where Windows Admin Center isn't in the same AD DS forest as target hosts, you must configure the target computers as trusted hosts."
    - content: "When the Windows Admin Center workstation is in the same AD DS forest as the resources it manages."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. If Windows Admin Center and its managed resources are in the same AD DS forest, Kerberos is used for authentication, and trusted hosts are not configured."
    - content: "In all circumstances, the administrator must configure trusted hosts."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. You only configure trusted hosts in some situations."
