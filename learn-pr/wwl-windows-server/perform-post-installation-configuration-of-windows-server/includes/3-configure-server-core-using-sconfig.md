Most of the Windows Server computers being deployed at Contoso are Server Core. Server Core has no GUI, so after the initial installation, you're presented with only a command prompt. 

## What is Sconfig?

Sconfig is a text-based tool that allows you to do the basic configuration of Server Core to prepare it for use in your production environment.

> [!NOTE]
> Sconfig is included in both Windows Server Desktop Experience and Server Core.

You typically use Sconfig to perform the initial configuration directly after the installation completes, but you can run it at any time to change the settings as required.
