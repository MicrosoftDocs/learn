  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "What is the minimum number of disks required to create a virtual disk with the three-way mirroring storage layout?"
    choices:
    - content: "3"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This isn't sufficient. Three-way mirroring requires at least five physical disks."
    - content: "4"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This isn't sufficient. Three-way mirroring requires at least five physical disks."
    - content: "5"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Three-way mirroring requires at least five physical disks."
  - content: "What's a limitation of Storage Spaces?"
    choices:
    - content: "It isn't possible to mix different types of storage in the same pool."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. You can use different types of storage in the same pool (for example, SATA, SAS, USB, and SCSI)."
    - content: "It isn't possible to use Storage Spaces on boot and system volumes."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Storage Spaces volumes aren't supported on boot or system volumes."
    - content: "After a storage pool is created, it isn't possible to increase its size."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. You can grow storage pools as required."
  - content: "How many cluster nodes are required to implement nested resiliency in Storage Spaces Direct?"
    choices:
    - content: "2"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. With nested resiliency, a two-node Storage Spaces Direct cluster can provide continuously accessible storage for apps and VMs even if one server node stops working, a drive fails in the other server node."
    - content: "3"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Nested resiliency is available only on clusters with two nodes."
    - content: "4"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Nested resiliency is available only on clusters with two nodes."
