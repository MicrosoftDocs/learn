  title: "Quick review"
  questions:
  - content: "An administrator at Contoso must create a user account in the `Contoso.com` domain. Which of the following group memberships enable the administrator to perform the task without exceeding the required privilege?"
    choices:
    - content: "The administrator should sign in using an account that belongs to Enterprise Admins."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Enterprise Admins can perform any administrative task in the entire AD DS forest. These are excessive rights for the required task."
    - content: "The administrator should sign in using an account that belongs to the local Administrators group."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The local Administrators group members can perform all administrative tasks on the local workstation only. This is insufficient for the task required."
    - content: "The administrator should sign in using an account that belongs to the Domain Admins group."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Members of the Domain Admins group can add user accounts in the local domain."
