    - content: "015: DNS domain name"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The DNS domain name is likely common for most client computers in an AD DS domain. Therefore, configuring this at the Server level is likely."
    - content: "006: DNS servers"

    - content: "DHCP Failover"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. The DHCP Failover feature allows two DHCP servers to work together to provide IP address information to clients. They can operate in two modes: Hot standby and Load balance."
