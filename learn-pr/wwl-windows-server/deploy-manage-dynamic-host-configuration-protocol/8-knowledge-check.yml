    - content: "The DHCP server must have a static IP address."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. A DHCP must have a manually assigned static IP address."
    - content: "To authorize a newly deployed server, you must use Windows PowerShell."

    - content: "015: DNS domain name"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The DNS domain name is likely common for most client computers in an AD DS domain. Therefore, configuring this at the Server level is likely."
    - content: "006: DNS servers"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The DNS client settings configured with this value are often assigned at the Server level."
  - content: "Which DHCP high availability option supports hot standby to provide the DHCP service."

    - content: "DHCP split scopes"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. In this case, each DHCP server controls a part of the entire range of IP addresses, and both servers are active on the same network."
    - content: "DHCP Failover"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. The DHCP Failover feature allows two DHCP servers to work together to provide IP address information to clients. They can operate in two modes: Hot standby and Load balance."
