The administrator is unable to establish a remote Windows PowerShell connection to the domain controller SEA-DC1. Assuming that all default settings have been applied, which of the following is the reason for this failure to connect?"
    choices:
    - content: "The administrator must enable remoting on the Windows 10 computer by running `Enable-PSremoting -force`."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The Windows 10 computer isn't being remotely managed and therefore doesn't need to be enabled for remoting."
    - content: "The administrator must enable remoting on the Windows Server domain controller computer SEA-DC1 by running `Enable-PSremoting -force`."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Windows Remote Management is automatically enabled on server computers by default."
