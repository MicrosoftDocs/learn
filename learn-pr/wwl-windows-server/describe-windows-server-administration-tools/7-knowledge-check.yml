      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. This is the default port for the Windows Admin Center website. However, you can change it during installation or subsequently."
    - content: "TCP 80"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The Windows Admin Center site doesn't use this port by default."
    - content: "TCP 443"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The Windows Admin Center site doesn't use this port by default."
  - content: "An administrator has setup a standalone Windows 10 Enterprise computer in a workgroup as an administrative workstation. The administrator intends to use Windows PowerShell remoting to manage remote Windows Servers in the Contoso.com domain. The administrator is unable to establish a remote Windows PowerShell connection to the domain controller SEA-DC1. Assuming that all default settings have been applied, which of the following is the reason for this failure to connect?"
    choices:
    - content: "The administrator must enable remoting on the Windows 10 computer by running `Enable-PSremoting -force`."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The Windows 10 computer is not being remotely managed and therefore doesn't need to be enabled for remoting."
    - content: "The administrator must enable remoting on the Windows Server domain controller computer SEA-DC1 by running `Enable-PSremoting -force`."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Windows Remote Management is automatically enabled on server computers by default."
    - content: "The administrator must add the SEA-DC1 computer as a trusted host by using the `Set-Item WSMan:localhost\\Client\\TrustedHosts -Value 'SEA-DC1.Contoso.com'` command."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Because the Windows 10 computer is not part of the domain, Kerberos authentication cannot be used. Therefore the administrator must configure the target server as a trusted host."
  - content: "An administrator wants to reconfigure the properties of some users in the Marketing OU of the Contoso.com domain. The administrator decides to use Windows PowerShell. Which of the following cmdlets would the administrator use to make changes?"
    choices:
    - content: "Get-ADuser"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Although the administrator might use this cmdlet to retrieve user details, this cmdlet doesn't commit changes."
    - content: "Set-ADuser"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. This cmdlet is used to commit changes to the selected objects."
    - content: "New-ADuser"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. You'll use this cmdlet to create a new user in AD DS."
