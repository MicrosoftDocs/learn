Learn about the core functionality of Windows Server failover clustering, various configuration options for failover clustering, and the use of cluster sets.

## Scenario

Contoso, Ltd. is a financial services company in Seattle with major offices located throughout the world. Most of its compute environment runs on-premises on Windows Server. This includes virtualized workloads on Windows Server 2016 hosts.

Contoso IT staff are migrating Contoso on-premises servers to Windows Server 2025. As part of the migration, Contoso plans to expand into additional sites and use virtualization to help expedite the process of bringing new sites online. The company is also generating larger volumes of data with plans for even more data in the future. Because of this, the company needs flexible storage options. Additionally, Contoso plans to increase the use of virtualization to optimize its computing environment because many physical servers are underutilized.
