Learn about configuring and managing Hyper-V virtual machines (VMs) in Windows Server 2019.

## Scenario

Contoso, Ltd. is a financial services company in Seattle with major offices located throughout the world. Most of its compute environment runs on-premises on Windows Server. This includes virtualized workloads on Windows Server 2016 hosts.

Contoso IT staff are migrating Contoso on-premises servers to Windows Server 2019. As part of the migration, Contoso plans to expand into additional sites and use virtualization to help expedite bringing a new site online. Contoso plans to increase the use of virtualization in general across their organization to optimize their computing environment because many physical servers are underutilized.

As a Hyper-V administrator, you need to determine what VM features and functionality are available in Hyper-V on Windows Server 2019, so you can help ensure workloads are optimized and stable, and then also determine what Hyper-V storage options are available and how they can be utilized.
