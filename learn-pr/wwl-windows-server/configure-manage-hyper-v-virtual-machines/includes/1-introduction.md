Learn about configuring and managing Hyper-V virtual machines (VMs) in Windows Server.

## Scenario

Contoso, Ltd. is a financial services company in Seattle with major offices located throughout the world. Most of its compute environment runs on-premises on Windows Server. This includes virtualized workloads on Windows Server 2016 hosts.

Contoso IT staff are migrating Contoso on-premises servers to Windows Server 2025. As part of the migration, Contoso plans to expand into additional sites and use virtualization to help expedite bringing a new site online. Contoso plans to increase the use of virtualization in general across their organization to optimize their computing environment because many physical servers are underutilized.
