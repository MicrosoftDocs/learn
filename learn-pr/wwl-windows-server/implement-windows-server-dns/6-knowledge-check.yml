    choices:
    - content: "Broadcast a NetBIOS name query."

      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Windows 10 computers check their DNS resolver cache before performing any other type of name resolution."
    - content: "Petition the configured DNS server."
      isCorrect: false

      explanation: "That's incorrect. Zone transfers must be manually configured between servers."
    - content: "Secondary zones are read-only."
      isCorrect: true

  - content: "In which of the following situations should an administrator at Contoso create a stub zone?"
    choices:
    - content: "When integrating with autonomous systems such as partner organizations."

    - content: "When providing for reverse lookups in the DNS infrastructure."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Reverse zones are used to resolve IP addresses into names."
    - content: "To provide for internet-based client computers that need to resolve internal DNS resource records."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This is a description of a public, internet-facing DNS server."
