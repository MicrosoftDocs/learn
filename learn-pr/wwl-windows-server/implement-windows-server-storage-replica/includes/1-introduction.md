Learn about the core functionality, benefits, use cases, and implementation of Storage Replica in Windows Server.

## Scenario

Contoso, Ltd. is a financial services company in Seattle with major offices located throughout the world. Most of its compute environment runs on-premises on Windows Server. This includes virtualized workloads on Windows Server 2016 hosts.

Contoso's IT staff are migrating Contoso on-premises servers to Windows Server 2025. As part of the migration, Contoso plans to expand into additional sites and use virtualization to help expedite bringing a new site online. The company is also generating larger volumes of data with plans for even more data in the future. Because of this, the company needs flexible storage options. Finally, Contoso plans to increase the use of virtualization to optimize their computing environment because many physical servers are underutilized.

As a Windows Server administrator, you were tasked with implementing a replication mechanism that would provide resiliency for data hosted on Windows Servers volumes. Your implementation must accommodate scenarios that require automatic failover with synchronous replication and manual failover with asynchronous replication. After completing this module, youâ€™ll understand how to accomplish these tasks.
