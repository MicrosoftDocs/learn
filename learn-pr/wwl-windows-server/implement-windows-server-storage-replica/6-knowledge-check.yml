  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "When implementing Storage Replica, what is the round-trip latency threshold above which asynchronous, rather than synchronous, replication should be used?"
    choices:
    - content: "1 ms"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Asynchronous replication enables replication across longer distances in cases where network round trip latency exceeds 5 ms."
    - content: "5 ms"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Asynchronous replication enables replication across longer distances in cases where network round trip latency exceeds 5 ms."
    - content: "50 ms"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Asynchronous replication enables replication across longer distances in cases where network round trip latency exceeds 5 ms."
  - content: "Which of the following ports needs to be open between servers replicating by using Storage Replica to allow SMB Direct traffic?"
    choices:
    - content: "443"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This port isn't required for Storage Replica."
    - content: "5445"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. To allow SMB Direct traffic, bi-directional connectivity for SMB port 445 is provided, plus port 5445 for SMB Direct, between the servers hosting the replicated volumes."
    - content: "5985"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This port, while required, is used by WS-MAN, not SMB Direct."
  - content: "Which Windows PowerShell cmdlet is used to determine whether the source and destination volumes meet the requirements of Storage Replica before its implementation?"
    choices:
    - content: "`Get-SRPartnership`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The `Get-SRPartnership` cmdlet is used to retrieve configuration of an existing Storage Replica partnership."
    - content: "`Test-SRTopology`"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. The `Test-SRTopology` cmdlet is used to determine whether the source and destination volumes meet Storage Replica requirements."
    - content: "`Get-SRGroup`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The `Get-SRGroup` cmdlet is used to retrieve configuration of an existing Storage Replica group."
