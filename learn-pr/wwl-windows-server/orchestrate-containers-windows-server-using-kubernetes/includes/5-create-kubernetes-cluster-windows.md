To help you to understand the requirements for orchestrating Contoso workloads in a Kubernetes cluster, the following high-level steps describe how to create a simple, two-node Kubernetes cluster.

## Create a Kubernetes cluster

The computers required to run the cluster can be physical or virtual, and are configured as listed in the following table.

|Computer|Machine name|OS|
|---|---|---|
|Administrator workstation|ADM|Windows Server 2019 or later|
|Master/control-plane node|K8S-M|Linux Ubuntu|
|Worker node|K8S-W|Windows Server 2019 or later Core|

To create a Kubernetes cluster, you can connect ADM to the node machines by using the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) or Secure Shell (SSH):

1. Open the network ports required for communication on both the **master** node and the **worker** node.

1. Install a container runtime on each of the nodes. For example:

    - For the **worker node** (a Windows node), install **Docker Enterprise Edition (EE)** from the Microsoft PowerShell (PS) Gallery by using the following Windows PowerShell commands:

        ```powershell
        # add the Docker EE repository from PSGallery
        Install-Module -Name DockerMsftProvider -Repository PSGallery -Force
    
        # install Docker EE from the PSGallery Docker repository
        Install-Package -Name docker -ProviderName DockerMsftProvider -Force
        ```

    - For the **master node** (a Linux node), install **Docker Enterprise Edition (EE)** by using the **Advanced Package Tool** and appropriate Bash commands in a terminal window.

1. Add the necessary **Kubernetes packages** to the master by using the **Advanced Package Tool** in a terminal window to install **kubeadm**, **kubelet**, and **kubectl**. The following is a simplified version of the required commands:

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install kubelet kubeadm kubectl
    ```

1. In a terminal window, initialize a Kubernetes cluster with **kubeadm** on the master by using the following command:

    ```bash
    kubeadm init
    ```

1. After the cluster initializes, follow the instructions in the terminal output to copy the **Kubernetes configuration (config)** file.

    - Make a note of the `kubeadm join` command in the terminal output because you use the `kubeadm join` command in a later step to join the worker node to the cluster. The following image is an example of the terminal output from the command `kubeadm init`:

    :::image type="content" source="../media/m26-kubeadm-init.png" alt-text="A screenshot of the terminal output from the command `kubeadm init` in a terminal window." border="false":::

1. Install a pod network for the cluster by adding a suitable network plug-in configuration manifest **.yaml** file such as **Flannel**. For example, in a terminal window on the master, add the file **network-plug-in.yaml** by using the following command:

    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f <network-plug-in.yaml>
    ```

1. Add the worker node to the cluster by copying the **Kubernetes config** file from **K8S-M** to **K8S-W**.

1. In a terminal window on **K8S-W**, join the worker node to the cluster by running the `kubeadm join` command that you noted previously. The command `kubeadm join` should be similar to the following:

    ```bash
    kubeadm join --token <token> <control-plane-host>:<control-plane-port> --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:<hash>
    ```

1. In a terminal window on the master, verify the installation by running the command `kubectl get nodes`. The output from the command `kubectl get nodes` should be similar to the following:

    ```bash
    user@K8S-M:~$ kubectl get nodes  

    NAME    STATUS   ROLES    AGE    VERSION  
    K8S-M   Ready    master   12m    v1.15.3  
    K8S-W   Ready    <none>   25m    v1.15.3  
    ```
