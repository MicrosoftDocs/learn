  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "Which of the following file system operations would involve the use of a CSV coordinator node?"
    choices:
    - content: "Writing to a file"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The coordinator node is responsible for applying metadata changes; however, it's not required when performing reads or writes targeting file content."
    - content: "Creating a file"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Creating a file involves a metadata change, which requires the use of the coordinator node."
    - content: "Reading from a file"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The coordinator node is responsible for applying metadata changes; however, it's not required when performing reads or writes targeting file content."
  - content: "What is the round-trip latency threshold which, if exceeded, an administrator should use asynchronous replication, rather than synchronous, when implementing Storage Replica?"
    choices:
    - content: "1 ms"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Asynchronous replication enables replication across longer distances in cases where network round-trip latency exceeds 5 ms."
    - content: "5 ms"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Asynchronous replication enables replication across longer distances in cases where network round-trip latency exceeds 5 ms."
    - content: "50 ms"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Asynchronous replication enables replication across longer distances in cases where network round-trip latency exceeds 5 ms."
  - content: "What is the maximum length of the name assigned to the Client Access Point when creating the SOFS Windows Server failover cluster role?"
    choices:
    - content: "10"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The clustered file server role emulates a Windows-based server, so its name, just as the name of any Windows computer, can't exceed 15 characters."
    - content: "15"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. The clustered file server role emulates a Windows-based server, so its name, just as the name of any Windows computer, can't exceed 15 characters."
    - content: "255"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The clustered file server role emulates a Windows-based server, so its name, just as the name of any Windows computer, can't exceed 15 characters."
