      explanation: "Incorrect. The coordinator node is responsible for applying metadata changes; however, it's not required when performing reads or writes targeting file content."
    - content: "Creating a file"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Creating a file involves a metadata change, which requires the use of the coordinator node."
    - content: "Reading from a file"

  - content: "What is the round-trip latency threshold which, if exceeded, an administrator should use asynchronous replication, rather than synchronous, when implementing Storage Replica?"
    choices:
    - content: "1 ms"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Asynchronous replication enables replication across longer distances in cases where network round-trip latency exceeds 5 ms."
    - content: "5 ms"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Asynchronous replication enables replication across longer distances in cases where network round-trip latency exceeds 5 ms."
    - content: "50 ms"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Asynchronous replication enables replication across longer distances in cases where network round-trip latency exceeds 5 ms."

    choices:
    - content: "10"
      isCorrect: false

    - content: "15"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The clustered file server role emulates a Windows-based server, so its name, just as the name of any Windows computer, can't exceed 15 characters."
