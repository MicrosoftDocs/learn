  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "Which Hyper-V technology allows shared disks for clustered VMs to be configured?"
    choices:
    - content: "Fixed disks"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Fixed disks are recommended for workloads that demand better IO performance, however, are not suitable for shared disks of clustered VMs ."
    - content: "VHD Set"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. VHD Set-based disks allow you to implement shared virtual disks for Hyper-V VMs."
    - content: "IDE disks"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. You can implement shared disks by attaching VHD Set-based disks to SCSI controller, however, not the IDE controller."
  - content: "What action must be taken to use Kerberos authentication when initiating Hyper-V live migration from a remote computer?"
    choices:
    - content: "Sign in to the source Hyper-V host."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This is a requirement when using CredSSP authentication."
    - content: "Modify the AD DS computer object of the source Hyper-V host."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Kerberos authentication requires additional configuration of constrained delegation, which involves modifying properties of AD DS computer accounts of the source Hyper-V host."
    - content: "Sign in to the target Hyper-V host."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This isn't required with CredSSP or Kerberos authentication."
  - content: "Which option needs to be chosen to perform VM storage migration from Hyper-V Manager?"
    choices:
    - content: "Export"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This option allows you to export VM disks, however, not live migrate VM storage."
    - content: "Move"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. You can migrate VM storage from a non-clustered Hyper-V server by using the **Move Wizard** in Hyper-V Manager."
    - content: "Enable Replication"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This option allows you to configure VM replication via Hyper-V Replica."
