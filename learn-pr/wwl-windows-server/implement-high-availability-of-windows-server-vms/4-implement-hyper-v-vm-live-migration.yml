    choices:
    - content: "Local disk of the first cluster node"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The demo illustrated the use of CSV to host disks of a highly available VM. You can't use a local volume on a cluster node to store disks of highly available VMs"
    - content: "CSV"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. The demo illustrated the use of CSV to host disks of a highly available VM."
    - content: "VHD Set"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. VHD Set is an option to implement shared storage for clustered VMs. The demo illustrated the use of CSV to host disks of a highly available VM."
