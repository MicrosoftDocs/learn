High availability is one of the primary requirements of business-critical workloads. Considering dominance of virtualization technologies, it's critical to ensure that high availability provisions extend to the Hyper-V platform.

## What are high-availability options for Hyper-V VMs?

To provide high availability for Hyper-V VMs and the services hosted within VMs, you can choose to:

- Implement VMs as a clustered role (host clustering).
- Implement clustering inside VMs (guest clustering).
- Use Network Load Balancing (NLB) inside VMs.

In this unit, you learn about the first two of these methods. NLB will be covered next.

### Host clustering

When implementing host clustering, you create a failover cluster consisting of nodes running the Hyper-V server role. With a Hyper-V cluster in place, you can configure VMs as highly available clustered resources. This way, you implement failover clustering protection at the Hyper-V host level. Effectively, the guest operating system and its workloads don't have to be cluster-aware. Some examples of workloads that aren't cluster-aware include Windows Server-based print server or custom, in-house developed business application.

In case the cluster node that hosts a highly available VM fails unexpectedly, another node will automatically restart or resume that VM. In case of a planned maintenance event that affects the node availability, you can move the VM to another node gracefully, in a controlled manner.

### Guest clustering

You configure failover clustering of Hyper-V VMs similarly to failover clustering of physical servers. To start, you provision two or more VMs and configure them as nodes of a failover cluster. While it's possible to implement this scenario by using a single Hyper-V host, such configuration is suitable only for a development or test environment.

For production environments, you should deploy VMs across separate Hyper-V host computers that are part of a separate failover cluster. With failover clustering implemented at both the host and VM levels, your workloads benefit from two levels of protection.

Implementing guest clustering warrants some additional considerations:

- The application or service you intend to protect must be failover clusterâ€“aware. With many Microsoft apps, such as Microsoft SQL Server and Microsoft Exchange Server, you can take advantage of their built-in support for Windows Server failover clustering. If such support isn't available, you might be able to implement a custom solution that relies on generic cluster roles, such as Generic Service, Generic Script, or Generic Application.
- To implement shared virtual disks for Hyper-V VMs, you can use Fibre Channel- or Internet Small Computer System Interface (iSCSI)-based storage. Hyper-V supports virtual hard disk (VHD) Sets, which facilitate this type of configuration.
- You should deploy multiple network adapters on the host computers and the VMs. When using iSCSI-based storage, you should set up a separate network connection dedicated for iSCSI traffic.
