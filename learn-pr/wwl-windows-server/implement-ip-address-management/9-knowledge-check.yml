  - content: "An administrator chooses to use GPO provisioning in IPAM. Three GPOs are created and linked to the AD DS domain object. What must the administrator do to prevent the GPOs from applying to all computer objects in the domain?"
    choices:
    - content: "Enable WMI filtering on the GPOs."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. WMI filtering is not used to control the scope of the application of IPAM GPOs."
    - content: "Link the GPOs to an OU that contains managed servers."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The administrator doesn't need to relink GPOs."
    - content: "Enable security filtering on the GPOs."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Security filtering prevents the GPOs from applying to all servers. When you select a server for IPAM to manage, that server is added to the security filtering for the GPO."
