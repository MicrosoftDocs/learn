  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "In a guarded fabric, which component checks the validity of guarded hosts and releases the keys to start protected VMs?"
    choices:
    - content: "AD DS security group"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. An AD DS security group is a security principal that collects user accounts, computer accounts, and other groups into manageable units."
    - content: "Microsoft Desktop Image Service Manager"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The Microsoft Desktop Image Service Manager is a disk imaging utility in which you can create .vhd or .vhdx file types. The Shielded Template Disk Creation Wizard then prepares and encrypts the .vhdx file to create a shielded VM template disk."
    - content: "HGS"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. In a guarded fabric, the HGS checks the validity of guarded hosts and releases the keys that are used to start protected VMs."
  - content: "Which of the following is used to prepare and encrypt a shielded VM template disk?"
    choices:
    - content: "The Shielded Template Disk Creation Wizard"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The Shielded Template Disk Creation Wizard is a tool for preparing and encrypting a shielded VM template disk."
    - content: "The Key Protection service"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The Key Protection service is a component of the HGS. The Key Protection service provides a guarded host with the security keys required to power on a shielded VM, and for migrating a shielded VM to another guarded host."
    - content: "A shielding data file"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A shielding data file is an encrypted file that protects important VM configuration information."
  - content: "Which of the following contains the encrypted secrets that are needed to deploy a shielded VM?"
    choices:
    - content: "A shielding data file"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. A shielding data file contains the encrypted secrets that are needed to deploy a shielded VM, in addition to information about signed template disks."
    - content: "A Trusted Computing Group Information log file"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. In TPM-mode attestation, a Trusted Computing Group Information log file is used by the HGS to check the health of a host's hardware when the VM starts up."
    - content: "The code integrity policy"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. In TPM-mode attestation, the code integrity policy allows the HGS to check the integrity of a host's software when the VM starts up."
