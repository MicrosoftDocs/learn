Learn about securing Hyper-V workloads in Windows Server 2019, installing and configuring the Host Guardian Service (HGS), the attestation modes available with the HGS, and the creation and deployment of shielded virtual machines (VMs).

## Scenario

Contoso, Ltd. is a financial services company in Seattle with major offices located throughout the world. Most of its compute environment runs on-premises on Windows Server. This includes virtualized workloads on Windows Server 2016 hosts.

Contoso IT staff are migrating Contoso on-premises servers to Windows Server 2019. As part of the migration, Contoso plans to expand into additional sites and use virtualization to help expedite bringing a new site online. Contoso plans to increase the use of virtualization in general across its organization to optimize its computing environment because many physical servers are underutilized.

As a new Windows Server administrator, you need to ensure all virtualized workloads meet compliance standards. As a result, it is necessary that you run encrypted VMs on a protected virtualization fabric in your environment. To meet this requirement, you need to determine what options are available for running secure virtualized workloads in Hyper-V on Windows server 2019 and how they can be utilized. After completing this module, you’ll understand how to accomplish this task.

## Learning objectives

After completing this module, you'll be able to:

- Describe the features and functionality of the HGS in Windows Server.
- Describe the attestation options available with the HGS.
- Describe shielded VMs, their creation, and their deployment.

## Prerequisites

To get the best learning experience from this module, you should have knowledge and experience of:

- Windows Server 2012 or Windows Server 2016.
