Learn about advanced Active Directory Domain Services administration tasks, including creating trust relationships, implementing Enhanced Security Administrative Environment (ESAE) forests, monitoring and troubleshooting AD DS replication, and creating custom AD DS partitions.

## Scenario

Contoso, Ltd. is a financial services company in Seattle with major offices located throughout the world. Most of its compute environment runs on-premises on Windows Server. This includes virtualized workloads on Windows Server 2016 hosts.

Contoso's IT staff are migrating Contoso on-premises servers to Windows Server 2025. As part of the migration, Contoso plans to expand into additional sites and use virtualization to help expedite bringing a new site online. The company is also generating larger volumes of data with plans for even more data in the future. Because of this, the company needs flexible storage options. Finally, Contoso plans to increase the use of virtualization to optimize their computing environment because many physical servers are underutilized.

As part of its technology expansion and modernization initiative, Contoso plans to consolidate its existing AD DS environment comprising several isolated AD DS forests, starting with the creation of trust relationships between them. Another major change that’s scheduled to take place in the upcoming months is a setup of an ESAE forest. Additionally, to facilitate deployment of a new in-house developed suite of applications, it’s necessary to create a custom AD DS partition.

As an experienced Windows Server administrator, you’re responsible for planning and implementing these changes. Throughout their implementation, you also need to ensure that the environment you manage remains fully operational. This includes monitoring and troubleshooting AD DS replication.
