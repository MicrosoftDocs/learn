  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "What functionality does the transitivity of a two-way forest trust provide?"
    choices:
    - content: "If you create a forest trust between Forest 1 and Forest 2 and you create a forest trust between Forest 2 and Forest 3, Forest 1 implicitly trusts Forest 3."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Forest trusts are not transitive across multiple forests."
    - content: "All domains in both trusted forests trust each other."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. When creating a trust, you specify the root domain of each forest. However, because forest trusts are transitive for all domains in each forest, you effectively establish a trust between each pair of domains across both forests."
    - content: "All users in the trusted forest can authenticate for services and access on all computers in the trusting forest."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This functionality is provided by forest-wide authentication property of a forest trust, not by its transitivity."
  - content: "How should a trust between an ESAE forest and a production forest be configured?"
    choices:
    - content: "One-way with forest-wide authentication and the ESAE forest trusting the production forest"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The ESAE forest model uses one-way trust with selective authentication and the production forest trusting the ESAE forest."
    - content: "One-way with selective authentication and the production forest trusting the ESAE forest"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. The ESAE forest model uses one-way trust with selective authentication and the production forest trusting the ESAE forest."
    - content: "One-way with the forest-wide authentication and the production forest trusting the ESAE forest"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The ESAE forest model uses one-way trust with selective authentication. Also, the production forest trusts the ESAE forest, not the other way around."
  - content: "Which of the following tools can be used to monitor and troubleshoot AD DS replication?"
    choices:
    - content: "Nltest.exe"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Nltest can test and reset the secure channel that the NetLogon service establishes between clients and the domain controller that logs them on. However, it's not suitable for monitoring or troubleshooting AD DS replication."
    - content: "Dcdiag.exe"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Dcdiag.exe supports several tests that allow you to monitor and troubleshoot replication."
    - content: "Netdom.exe"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Netdom.exe allows management of AD DS domains and trust relationships, but isn't suitable for monitoring or troubleshooting AD DS replication."
