Learn about the core functionality, benefits, use cases, and implementation of Internet Small Computer Systems Interface (iSCSI) in Windows Server 2019.

## Scenario

Contoso, Ltd. is a financial services company in Seattle with major offices located throughout the world. Most of its compute environment runs on-premises on Windows Server. This includes virtualized workloads on Windows Server 2016 hosts.

Contoso IT staff are migrating Contoso on-premises servers to Windows Server 2019. As part of the migration, Contoso plans to expand into additional sites and use virtualization to help expedite bringing a new site online. The company is also generating larger volumes of data with plans for even more data in the future. Because of this, the company needs flexible storage options. Finally, Contoso plans to increase the use of virtualization to optimize their computing environment because many physical servers are underutilized.

As a Windows Server administrator, you're responsible for configuring Windows Server 2019 storage on the servers you manage to allow connections from a wide range of clients and applications. Some of them require iSCSI-based access. To accommodate these requirements, you not only need to configure Windows Server operating system as an iSCSI target, but also considers the need for sufficient network bandwidth and resiliency in case of an isolated failure that affects network connectivity.
