  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "What is the minimum recommended available bandwidth of a network suitable for iSCSI traffic?"
    choices:
    - content: "100 Mbps"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. To ensure sufficient performance, the network should provide the throughput of at least 1 Gbps."
    - content: "1 Gbps"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. To ensure sufficient performance, the network should provide the throughput of at least 1 Gbps."
    - content: "40 Gbps"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. To ensure sufficient performance, the network should provide the throughput of at least 1 Gbps."
  - content: "What type of authentication does iSCSI support?"
    choices:
    - content: "Kerberos"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. iSCSI supports CHAP to authenticate initiator connections and reverse CHAP to enable the initiator to authenticate the iSCSI target."
    - content: "CHAP"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. iSCSI supports CHAP to authenticate initiator connections and reverse CHAP to enable the initiator to authenticate the iSCSI target."
    - content: "PAP"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. iSCSI supports CHAP to authenticate initiator connections and reverse CHAP to enable the initiator to authenticate the iSCSI target."
  - content: "Which of the following distinguishes MPIO from MCS?"
    choices:
    - content: "Automatic failover"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Both MPIO and MCS support automatic failover."
    - content: "Multiple, concurrent sessions to the same target over different network paths"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Microsoft MPIO allows the initiator to establish multiple sessions to the same target over different network paths. MCS enables multiple TCP/IP connections from the initiator to the target for the same iSCSI session."
    - content: "Supports load balancing policies"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Both MCS and MPIO support load balancing policies."
