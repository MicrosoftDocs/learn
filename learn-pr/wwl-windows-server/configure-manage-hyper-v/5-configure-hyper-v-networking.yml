  title: "Quick review"
  questions:
  - content: "What type of virtual switches facilitate communication between the VMs running on the same Hyper-V host, but not between the VMs and the Hyper-V host?"
    choices:
    - content: "External"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. An External virtual switch is used to map a network to a specific network adapter or network adapter team. It binds to the physical network adapter so that the virtual machines can access a physical network, and as such allows communication between the VMs on a Hyper-V host and the Hyper-V host."
    - content: "Internal"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. An Internal virtual switch is used to communicate between each of the VMs on a Hyper-V host, and to communicate between the VMs and the Hyper-V host."
    - content: "Private"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. A Private virtual switch facilitates communication between the VMs on the same Hyper-V host but not between the VMs and the Hyper-V host. It can be used only by the virtual machines that run on the physical host."
