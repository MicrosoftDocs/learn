  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "You have primary and replica Hyper-V servers which are both members of the same AD DS forest. To allow replication between the Hyper-V servers, which Hyper-V Replica authentication can you use?"
    choices:
    - content: "Kerberos authentication only"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Kerberos is a valid authentication method when Hyper-V primary and replica servers are members of the same AD DS forest; however, it isn't the only authentication type that can be used."
    - content: "Certificate-based authentication only"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Certificate is a valid authentication when Hyper-V primary and replica servers are members of the same AD DS forest; however, it isn't the only authentication type that can be used."
    - content: "Either Kerberos or Certificate-based authentication"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Either Kerberos or Certificate-based authentication can be used when Hyper-V primary and replica servers are members of the same AD DS forest."
  - content: "Performing extended replication involves replicating a VM from which Hyper-V VM?"
    choices:
    - content: "The primary VM"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Extended replication is only possible from the replica VM."
    - content: "The replica VM"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Extended replication is only possible from the replica VM."
    - content: "Either primary or replica VM"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Extended replication is only possible from the replica VM."
  - content: "During replication between two on-premises locations, customer data takes which route to the secondary site?"
    choices:
    - content: "From the primary site through Azure to the secondary site"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. During replication between two on-premises locations, customer data is never transferred via Azure."
    - content: "The shortest route, even if that involves transferring via Azure"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. During replication between two on-premises locations, customer data is never transferred via Azure."
    - content: "From the primary site directly to the secondary site over LAN/WAN or VPN"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. During replication between two on-premises locations, customer data is transferred from the primary site directly to the secondary site over LAN/WAN or VPN, and never via Azure."
