  title: "Quick review"
  questions:
  - content: "What type of failover initiates a non-disruptive failover from a replica server?"
    choices:
    - content: "Test Failover"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Test Failover is a non-disruptive task that enables you to test a VM on a replica server while the primary VM is running without interrupting the replication. A Test Failover can only be initiated on replica Hyper-V host on the replicated VM."
    - content: "Planned Failover"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Planned Failover can only be initiated on the primary server on the primary VM. No data loss will occur, but the VM will be unavailable for a period of time during its startup."
    - content: "Failover"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Failover can only be used if the primary VM is either unavailable or is turned off. It's an unplanned event that can result in data loss because changes at the primary VM might not have replicated before the disaster happened."
