In this module, you learned how to interact with the GitHub API from GitHub Actions by using GitHub Script.

You learned about:

- Using GitHub Script in your workflow.
- Commenting on issues by using Octokit.
- Adding issues to a project board by using Octokit.
- Using the workflow expression syntax to filter when jobs run in a workflow.

GitHub Script is great for interacting with GitHub from GitHub Actions. But what if you want to interact with the API from somewhere else? In that case, you can learn to [Automate DevOps processes by using GitHub Apps](/training/modules/automate-devops-github-apps/).
