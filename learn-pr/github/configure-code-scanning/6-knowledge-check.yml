      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Deleting a branch doesn't trigger a scan by default when code scanning is enabled. It can however be configured to trigger a scan."
  - content: "Which of the following are the tools used to upload a SARIF file?"
    choices:
    - content: "The tools used are GitHub Actions, the code scanning API, and the CodeQL CLI."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. GitHub Actions, the code scanning API, and the CodeQL CLI are all tools you can use to upload a SARIF file. The best upload method depends on which of the tools you use."
    - content: "The tools used are GitHub Actions, the ESLint analysis tool, the code scanning API, and the CodeQL CLI."

      explanation: "Incorrect. Some of the tools listed are used to upload SARIF files, but not all of them. "
  - content: "What is the difference between scheduled versus triggered events in code scanning?"
    choices:

      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Scheduled events are not more difficult to configure than triggered events. Both can be configured easily. "
