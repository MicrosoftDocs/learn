    choices:
    - content: "The tools used are GitHub Actions, the code scanning API, and the CodeQL CLI."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. GitHub Actions, the code scanning API, and the CodeQL CLI are all tools you can use to upload a SARIF file. The best upload method depends on which of the tools you use."
    - content: "The tools used are GitHub Actions, the ESLint analysis tool, the code scanning API, and the CodeQL CLI."
