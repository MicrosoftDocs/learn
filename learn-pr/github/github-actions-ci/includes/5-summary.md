In this module, you implemented a CI solution by using GitHub Actions and workflows. 

You can now:

- Build and test a Node.js project by using GitHub Actions and a workflow template.
- Debug a failed test by using the GitHub Actions log.
- Customize your workflow with GitHub Actions to:
  - Create a build artifact and save it.
  - Get access to your build artifacts.
  - Test against multiple targets.
  - Add labels to your pull requests.

## Next step

To continue your journey with GitHub Actions, check out the next module on this learning path. You can expand on what you learned here and use GitHub Actions for continuous delivery and implementing infrastructure as code.
