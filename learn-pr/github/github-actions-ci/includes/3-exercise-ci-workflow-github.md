This exercise checks your knowledge about how to create, customize and test a continuous integration workflow for a project. 

## Getting started

When you select the _Start the exercise on GitHub_ button below, you'll go to a public GitHub template repository. That repository prompts you to complete a series of small challenges. Before starting the exercise, complete these tasks:

- Select the _Start course_ button or the _Use this template_ feature within the template repository. This will prompt you to create a new repository. We recommend creating a public repository, as private repositories will have [GitHub Actions minutes billed](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-github-actions/about-billing-for-github-actions). 
- After you make your own repository from the template, wait about 20 seconds and refresh.
- Follow the instructions in the repository's README.md to understand how the exercise works, its learning objectives, and how to successfully complete the exercise.

After you've finished the exercise in GitHub, return here for:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * A quick knowledge check 
> * A summary of what you've learned
> * A badge for completing this module

>[!Note] 
> You do not need to modify any of the workflow files to complete this exercise. 
> **Altering the contents in this workflow can break the exercise's ability to validate your actions, provide feedback, and grade the results.**
