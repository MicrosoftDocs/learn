This exercise checks your knowledge about how to create, customize, and test a continuous integration workflow for a project. 

## Get started

When you select the following _Start the exercise on GitHub_ button, you'll go to a public GitHub template repository. That repository prompts you to complete a series of small challenges.

Before you start the exercise, complete these tasks:

- Select the _Start course_ button or the _Use this template_ feature in the template repository. This action prompts you to create a new repository. We recommend that you create a public repository because  [GitHub Actions minutes are billed](https://docs.github.com/billing/managing-billing-for-github-actions/about-billing-for-github-actions) for private repositories.
- After you make your own repository by using the template, wait about 20 seconds, and then refresh the page.
- Follow the instructions in the repository's `readme.md` file to understand how the exercise works, its learning objectives, and how to successfully complete the exercise.

After you finish the exercise in GitHub, return here for:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> - A quick knowledge check 
> - A summary of what you've learned
> - A badge for completing this module

>[!NOTE]
> *Altering the contents in this workflow can break the exercise's ability to validate your actions, provide feedback, and grade the results.* You don't need to modify any of the workflow files to complete this exercise.
