  questions:
  - content: "How does GitHub Copilot work?"
    choices:
    - content: "GitHub Copilot uses prompts and natural language text that you type to provide coding suggestions."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! GitHub Copilot is trained on billions of lines of code. It turns natural language prompts into coding suggestions across dozens of languages."
    - content: "GitHub Copilot uses lights, that you type, and it provides suggestions based on what you type."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "GitHub Copilot uses prompts and natural language text that you type to provide coding suggestions."
    - content: "GitHub Copilot uses radio language, that you type, and it provides suggestions based on what you type."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "GitHub Copilot doesn't use radio language."
  - content: "What are some GitHub Copilot Free features?"
    choices:
    - content: "It's a free unrestrticted AI tool that works independent of code editors."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. GitHub Copilot Free has a quota for code completions and chat messages."
    - content: "It provides several suggestions and chats per month directly in your IDE and on github.com."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. It also supports multi-file editing and and switching models!"
    - content: "An option to enable slower responses, preservering your Copilot Pro quota."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Copilot Free has quoat restrictions. Copilot Pro provides unlimited code suggestions and chat."
  - content: "How can you accept GitHub Copilot's suggestions?"
    choices:
    - content: "Press the <kbd>Tab</kbd> key."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Copilot offers you a suggestion, which appears as grey code if you use black as your text color. To accept the suggestion, you need to press the <kbd>Tab</kbd> key."
    - content: "Press the <kbd>F1</kbd> key."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "False. This option doesn't work to accept GitHub Copilot suggestions."
    - content: "Press the <kbd>F4</kbd> key."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "False. This option doesn't work to accept GitHub Copilot suggestions."
  - content: "Identify which statement is valid and select the correct answer:"
    choices:
    - content: "A prompt, which is our output, is a collection of songs that tells our copilot what to generate."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "False. A prompt isn't a collection of songs."
    - content: "A prompt, which is our input, is a collection of instructions or guidelines that tell our copilot what to generate."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "A prompt is crucial in eliciting specific responses from Copilot. The prompt might be a comment that steers Copilot to generate code on your behalf or writing code that Copilot autocompletes."
    - content: "A prompt, which is our document, is a collection of laptops that tells our Copilot what to generate."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "False. A prompt isn't our document nor a collection of laptops that tells our Copilot what to generate."
  - content: "What does the quality of the output from GitHub Copilot depend on?"
    choices:
    - content: "Your code editor."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Not correct. It depends on how well you detailed your prompt."
    - content: "How well your extensions were installed."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "False. It doesn't depend on how well your extensions were installed."
    - content: "How well you crafted your prompt."
