In this module, we looked at how GitHub Codespaces can significantly improve the software development lifecycle. Offering features that range from creating a repository from a GitHub template to adding animations with live suggestions. GitHub Codespaces allows you to customize your coding experience and GitHub Copilot guides you in each step of the way.

After finishing this module, you should be able to:

- Configure a GitHub repository in Codespaces and install the GitHub Copilot extension.
- Engineer prompts for your project that follow best practices to generate suggestions from GitHub Copilot.
- Use GitHub Copilot Chat to ask and receive coding-related questions.

## Delete your Codespaces resources

To avoid consuming all of your monthly GitHub Codespaces time, it's important to delete your resources after you upload your changes to your repository.

Use the following steps to delete your Codespace instance:

1. Go to [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces).
1. Find your Codespace instance in the list, and select the **...** menu to display your options.
1. Select **Delete** to remove your Codespace instance.

>[!Note]
> If you don't commit your changes to your repository, you will lose all your work. Therefore, it's important to commit and push your changes before deleting your Codespace instance.
