In this exercise, you'll navigate to a GitHub repository to validate your ability to install a GitHub App for a GitHub organization.

This GitHub exercise is graded automatically once you've attempted a solution to the challenge. The results of your actions, as well as helpful feedback, are provided in real time within the `grade-learner` workflow logs.

Here are some helpful tips before you begin the exercise:

- Read the **About this exercise** section in the exercise's repository README to understand how the exercise works.

>[!Note]
> A grading script exists under `.github/workflows/grading.yml`. You don't need to modify this workflow to complete this exercise. **Altering the contents in this workflow can break the exercise's ability to validate your actions, provide feedback, or grade the results**.
