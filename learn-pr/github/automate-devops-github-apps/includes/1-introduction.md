When thinking about ways to add efficiency within your GitHub workflow, you can build apps and integrations to improve and customize your workflow. By using GitHub Apps and OAuth Apps, you can help reduce the amount of time spent on manual tasks and customize your workflow to meet individual, team, and company needs. You can also share these integrations with others on GitHub Marketplace, and in return, use apps and integrations that other developers have built.

Suppose you are looking for a feature that GitHub doesn't yet support. Maybe you'd like to automate some of the more mundane tasks you deal with, such as following up with contributors who didn't label an issue they created. Or maybe you'd like to automatically close any branches or pull requests that haven't been touched in months. Whatever your need is, you're probably not alone. The good news is that GitHub Apps offer a way for you to fill the gaps and automate processes in your repository. The better news is that someone else might have already built the solution you need.

Optimizing the value of apps and features to manage users in your workflow to help speed up your processes while maintaining efficiency, security, and reliability. In this module, you'll learn about the use of these tools and their features.

In this module, you learn how to automate DevOps processes by using GitHub Apps that handle repetitive tasks, enforce team policies, and maintain a tidy repository.
