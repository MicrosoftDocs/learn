  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "Which of the following scenarios is **not** a good candidate to be built as a GitHub App?"
    choices:
    - content: "An app that checks the spelling of pull request titles after they're created."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This scenario is a good candidate for a GitHub app."
    - content: "An app that requests a user to update the name of a pushed branch if they don't follow your team's `user/feature` branch naming convention."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This scenario is a good candidate for a GitHub app."
    - content: "An app that allows a user to approve a pull request from a custom tool."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "This scenario wouldn't be a good candidate for a GitHub app because it would need to operate on behalf of a specific user."
  - content: "When should you build an OAuth App instead of a GitHub App?"
    choices:
    - content: "When your app needs to access the GitHub API."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Both app models support accessing the GitHub API."
    - content: "When your app needs to operate on behalf of a specific user."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "OAuth apps run as the user who authorized them. GitHub Apps run as themselves."
    - content: "When your app needs to consume webhooks."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Both app models support consuming webhooks."
  - content: "Which of the following choices is **not** a benefit of using webhooks over polling?"
    choices:
    - content: "Webhooks have better network accessibility than polling."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Webhooks require the publisher to connect to the subscriber to push data, which may not be practical if the subscriber is behind a firewall. However, you can mitigate this scenario through relay services like smee.io."
    - content: "Webhooks use less bandwidth than polling."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Webhooks only send data when there's data to send. Polling makes regular requests even when nothing has changed."
    - content: "Webhooks offer faster delivery of new data than polling."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Webhooks send data as soon as it becomes available. Polling can be delayed up to the polling interval length."
