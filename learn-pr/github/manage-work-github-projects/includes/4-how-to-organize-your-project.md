Now that you added issues and pull requests to your Project, it's time to organize to keep track of the great work you and your team are doing.

In this unit, you learn:

- How to create a field to track and group by priority.
- How to add an iteration field.
- How to create a board view.

## How to create a field to track and group by priority

To group a set of issues and pull requests by priority, you need to first create a new field.

1. First in the table view, in the rightmost field header, select **+**.
2. Then, select **New field**.

3. Next, type the name of your field; in this case, it's *Priority*.
4. Select the **Field Type** drop-down and select a suitable field type for your new field.
5. To crcreate your own classification for your new field, select the **Single select** option.

6. In the **Options** text box, start to add your different priority levels. You can label them as **Urgent**, **High**, **Medium**, and **Low**.
7. Select **Save**.

Now that you have your priority classification set up, you need to classify your issues and pull requests based on priority. To make a classification, select the issue or pull request you want to classify in the field row titled **Priority**. Now, in the drop-down field, select the priority you want to choose for this particular issue or pull request.

Repeat for your remaining pull requests and issues.

Great!

Now, let's group your issues and pull requests by priority to make it easier to focus on urgent and high priority items.

1. Select the **down arrow** next to the name of your currently opened view.
2. Then, select the **Group** option.
3. Next, select **Priority**.
4. Now you should be able to view issues and pull requests based on the priority you assigned them.
5. One of the great features of this particular view is you can now drag and drop issues into new priority fields easily.

Now that you have your work prioritized, let's tackle timelines and iterations.

If you want to save this view, select the **Save changes** button on the top-right of the list view.

## How to add an iteration field

Adding an iteration field to your Project can help you and your team visualize the balance of upcoming work in order to help everyone stay on track. An iteration field enables you to set up phases for your tasks in a tangible timeframe to keep you and your team organized.

1. To first add an iteration field, first go to the table view of your Project. In the rightmost field header, select **+**.
2. Select **New field**.
3. Type in the name of your iteration; for example, *Project Phase* or *Sprint*.

   :::image type="content" source="../media/4-iteration-field.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Iteration Field Date Editing Field with the options to edit start date and duration in weeks.":::

4. Next, you can change the duration of each iteration. Type a new number, then select the drop-down and select either **days** or **weeks**.
5. Select **Save**.

Once you have your iteration field set up, you can now assign what iteration phase you want each of your issues and pull requests to fall under.

Now that you have prioritized and organized your Project, let's take a look at how to view your Project from a different perspective – a board view.

## How to create a board view

A board view of your Project enables you to view upcoming tasks in a more visualizing way.

Let's walk through how to get your board view up and running.

1. To the right of your existing views, select **New view**.
2. Select the **down arrow** next to the name of the currently open view.
3. Under **Layout**, select **Board**.
4. When you changed the layout, your Project displayed an indicator to show that the view was modified. Save this view by selecting the **Save changes** button to top-right of the board.
5. Now, you can drag and drop issues and pull requests to the various columns.
6. You can also rename the view by double-clicking on the view's tab and typing in the new name.
7. Once you select out of the tab, the name of your new view is automatically saved.
