Imagine you want to organize your team's feature backlog. Projects, GitHub's built-in program management tool, is a perfect way to organize and prioritize your team's work in a single space.

In this unit you'll learn:

- How to create a Project
- How to set the name, description, and README of your Project
- How to add issues and pull requests to your Project

## Creating an organization level Project

First we want to lay the foundation of your Project by creating a new Project. This task is fairly simple and can be completed relatively quickly.

1. First, in the top right corner of GitHub.com, click your profile photo, then click Your organizations.

1. Once on **Your organization page**, click the name of your organization you want to create a new Project for.
1. Under your organization name, click Projects.
1. Then click the green button labeled New Project.
1. Next a pop-up prompts you to select either a template or an empty Project. Let's select a **Start from scratch** option and select **Table** and then click the green **Create button**.

You just created a Project!

You can also create a personal Project by clicking your profile photo and navigating to **Your projects**. Once you are on your Projects page, you can simply click on the green button titled **New project**.

## Setting your project's name, description, and README

Let's define your Project in a couple of different ways so that your team can easily understand what you're tracking.

1. To edit your Project's name, description and README navigate to your newly created Project and in the top right, click the three dots to open the menu.
1. In the menu, click Settings.
1. Edit the name of the Project and it saves automatically.
1. Next add a short 5-7 word description of the Project and make sure to click Save afterwards.
1. Then to update your Project's README, under README, type out a bit more information for your team to understand why you created this Project and what you hope to accomplish with it. And when you're done make sure to click Save.

## Adding issues and pull requests to your Project

Adding in issues and pull requests to your Project is what makes the tool so powerful. Projects enables you to know the status of tasks your team is working on in order to coordinate and complete your goals.

Let's go through the different ways to add issues and pull requests to your Project.

### Adding an existing issue and pull request

1. First, copy the url of an existing issue or pull request.
1. Next, place your cursor in the bottom row of the Project, next to the + and paste the URL of your issue or pull request.

   :::image type="content" source="../media/3-project-list-view-url-sample.png" alt-text="Screenshot of a Project in List view with an example of a URL of an Issue being pasted into the Projects.":::

1. Press return. Your issue or pull request appears as a task in your Project.

### Searching for an existing issue and pull request

1. You can also search for existing issues or pull requests by simply adding a new item.
1. Enter #.

   :::image type="content" source="../media/3-project-list-view-search.png" alt-text="Screenshot of a Project in List view, focused on searching for an existing Issue or Pull Request by adding a # and typing in key phrases.":::

1. Select the repository where the pull request or issue is located. You can type part of the repository name to narrow down your options.
1. Select the issue or pull request. You can also start typing the title to find the one you want.

### Bulk adding issues and pull request

If you have an existing repository that you'd like to track using Projects, you can save time by bulk adding issues and pull requests. It will allow you to start organizing your team faster.

1. First, in the bottom row of the Project, click +.
1. Next, click Add item from repository.
1. To change the repository, click the dropdown and select a repository. The issues and pull requests populate.
1. You can either select all or select the ones you want to include.
