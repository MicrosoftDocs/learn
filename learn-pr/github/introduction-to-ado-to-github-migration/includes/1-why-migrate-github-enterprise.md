GitHub Enterprise (GHE) has evolved into a powerful, agentic DevOps platform that supports the complex workflows of modern software development. Unlike traditional source control systems, GHE offers extensibility through over 17,000 third-party apps and services, allowing organizations to tailor their development environments to meet specific needs. Developers can work seamlessly across the tools they know and love—including popular IDEs and CI/CD platforms—while benefiting from GitHub's integrated ecosystem that enhances productivity and collaboration. 

Paired with GitHub Copilot, which integrates directly into development environments throughout GHE, Copilot accelerates onboarding, reduces cognitive load, and boosts developer satisfaction. When paired with GitHub Codespaces and Actions, Copilot enables a frictionless development experience that supports rapid iteration and innovation.
