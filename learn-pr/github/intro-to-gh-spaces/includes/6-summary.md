GitHub Copilot Spaces deliver significant business value by enabling teams to achieve faster, more accurate outcomes through context-grounded AI assistance. By curating a focused set of sources—such as code files, documentation, issues, and pull requests—Spaces reduce ambiguity and improve the predictability and quality of Copilot's responses. This targeted approach minimizes rework, accelerates decision-making, and ensures outputs align with organizational standards. Spaces also enhance collaboration and governance by leveraging GitHub's existing permission model, making it easier to share knowledge securely while maintaining compliance. Ultimately, Copilot Spaces help organizations scale expertise, reduce cognitive load, and improve productivity across development and operational workflows.

You should now be able to:

- Explain what Spaces are and when to use them versus general Copilot Chat
- Create, configure, and iterate on a Space with targeted context and custom instructions
- Apply best practices for high‑quality, grounded answers within model context limits
