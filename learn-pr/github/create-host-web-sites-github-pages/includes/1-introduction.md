GitHub Pages are free static web sites hosted directly from your GitHub repository. Anyone can use standard technologies like YAML and Markdown, to build and maintain a site in minutes.

Suppose you want to set up a basic web site to share information about the project on which you're working. It might be a personal site, like a resume or portfolio; or it might be a professional site, like a user guide or developer reference. With GitHub Pages, you can spin up the site in minutes and allow anyone with a basic understanding of Markdown to contribute to it. You also get all the benefits of GitHub for source control, including branches and pull requests.

In this module, you learn how to set up and use GitHub Pages to host both personal and professional sites.
