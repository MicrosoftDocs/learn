This exercise checks your knowledge on setting up and using GitHub Pages.

## Getting started

When you select the  *Start the exercise on GitHub* button at the bottom of the page, it takes you to a public GitHub template repository that prompts you to complete a series of small challenges. Before you can begin the exercise, complete the following tasks:

- Select the *Start course* button or the *Use this template* feature within the template repository. This prompts you to create a new repository. We recommend creating a public repository, as private repositories use Actions minutes. After you make your own repository from the template, wait about 20 seconds and refresh.

- Follow the instructions in the repository's README to understand how the exercise works, its learning objectives, and how to successfully complete the exercise.

When you finish the exercise in GitHub, return here for:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> - A quick knowledge check. 
> - A summary of what you've learned.
> - To earn a badge for completing this module.

>[!Note] 
> You do not need to modify any of the workflow files to complete this exercise.
