Now that you know the basics of the GitHub platform, let’s go over some platform management.

In this unit, we'll cover:

- Managing notifications and subscriptions.
- Subscribing to threads and finding threads where you're mentioned.
- Publicizing your project or organization on GitHub pages.

## Managing notifications and subscriptions

Notifications help you stay up to date on important activity across your repositories and teams. Managing your subscriptions ensures you only get updates for the work that matters most to you.

You can subscribe to notifications for:

- Specific issues, pull requests, or gists
- Repository activity like issues, pull requests, releases, or discussions
- Workflow statuses for repositories using GitHub Actions
- All activity across a repository

You're automatically subscribed when you interact with conversations (commenting, opening an issue, being assigned), but you can also manually manage subscriptions as needed.

If you're no longer interested in receiving updates, you can unsubscribe, unwatch, or customize the types of notifications you receive.

## Subscribing to threads and finding threads where you're mentioned

Subscribing to individual threads, such as a particular issue or pull request, ensures you receive updates even if you weren't originally involved.

You can subscribe to a thread by:

- Selecting **Subscribe** on the right-hand sidebar of an issue, pull request, or discussion.

To find conversations where you're mentioned:

- Use the search qualifier `mentions:<username>` in the GitHub search bar to locate issues and pull requests where you were @mentioned.

This makes it easy to keep track of discussions that require your input.

### Filtering notifications

GitHub allows you to filter notifications using watch settings:

- **Watching**: Receive notifications for all activity.
- **Not watching**: Receive notifications only when you're participating or @mentioned.
- **Ignore**: No notifications at all for a repository.
- **Custom**: Fine-tune what types of activity (like pull requests, issues, or discussions) trigger notifications.

You can manage watch settings by selecting **Watch** at the top of a repository page.

### Configuring notification settings

You can configure where you receive notifications:

- **Email**: Notifications delivered to your registered email address.
- **Web**: Notifications viewed directly in your GitHub dashboard.
- **Mobile**: Push notifications using the GitHub mobile app.
- **Custom notifications**: Configure specific event types for different channels.

Notification settings are managed under your GitHub account settings in **Notifications**.

## What are GitHub Pages?

To round out our journey of GitHub, let’s tackle GitHub pages. You can use GitHub Pages to publicize and host a website about yourself, your organization, or your project directly from a repository on GitHub.com.

GitHub Pages is a static site-hosting service that takes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files straight from a repository on GitHub. Optionally, you can run the files through a build process and publish a website. Edit and push your changes, and your project is live for the public in a visually organized way.

Next up, we'll walk through an exercise to get you started with GitHub. In the next exercise, you'll:

- Create a new repository.
- Create a new branch.
- Commit a file.
- Open a pull request.
- And merge a pull request.
