Now that you know the basics of the GitHub platform, let’s go over some platform management.

In this unit, we'll cover:

- Managing notifications and subscriptions.
- Subscribing to threads and finding threads you're mentioned in.
- Publicizing your or your organization on GitHub pages.

## Managing notifications and subscriptions

You can choose to receive ongoing updates about specific activity on GitHub.com through a subscription. Notifications are the updates that you receive for specific activity to which you're subscribed.

### Subscription options

You can choose to subscribe to notifications for:

- A conversation in a specific issue, pull request, or gist.
- All activity in a repository.
- CI activity, such as the status of workflows in repositories set up with GitHub Actions.
- Repository issues, pull requests, releases, security alerts, or discussions (if enabled).

In some instances, you're automatically subscribed to conversations on GitHub; for example, opening a pull request or issue, commenting on a thread, or being assigned to an issue or pull request.

If you're no longer interested in a conversation, you can unsubscribe, unwatch, or customize the types of notifications you'll receive in the future.

If you're ever interested in issues that mention a certain user, you can use *mentions:* as the qualifier to find those specific issues.

## What are GitHub Pages?

To round out our journey of GitHub, let’s tackle GitHub pages.

You can use GitHub Pages to publicize and host a website about yourself, your organization, or your project directly from a repository on GitHub.com.

GitHub Pages is a static site-hosting service that takes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files straight from a repository on GitHub. Optionally, you can run the files through a build process and publishes a website.

Just edit and push your changes, and your project is live for the public in a visually organized way.

Next up, we'll walk through an exercise to get you started with GitHub. In the next exercise, you'll:

- Create a new repository.
- Create a new branch.
- Commit a file.
- Open a pull request.
- And merge a pull request.
