  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "What kind of files are best stored in GitHub?"
    choices:
    - content: "Large binary files, like videos."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "It isn't recommended that you use GitHub for the version control of large binary files. However, there are companion solutions like **git-lfs** that offer a better solution."
    - content: "Binary project files, like spreadsheets and presentations."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "It isn't recommended that you use GitHub for the version control of binary files like spreadsheets and presentations. You're better off using portal software that supports specialized versioning of these kinds of files."
    - content: "Text files, like source code."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "GitHub is ideal for the version control of text files."
  - content: "Why is a `.gitignore` file important to your repository?"
    choices:
    - content: "It defines which users aren't allowed to participate in your repository discussions and pull requests."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Project authorization is managed through **Manage Access** under the **Security** tab of your repository."
    - content: "It helps you enforce policy around which files should be excluded from version control."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "It specifically defines which files and directories should be excluded from version control. This file is useful for keeping sensitive data, build output, and other files out of your repository."
    - content: "It's just a token file required by GitHub to make sure you're following the migration instructions closely. If you ignore it, your repository migration fails."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "`.gitignore` is an optional file that helps you manage which files version control should ignore."
  - content: "Which of the following methods is **not** a valid way to upload new project files to GitHub?"
    choices:
    - content: "Email a password protected zip of your project to GitHub support along with instructions for the repository's creation. Be sure to include the zip password in the same email."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "This option isn't supported yet."
    - content: "Use the `git` client or other Git-friendly tool."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This option is great and will help you build experience for future updates."
    - content: "Use the browser interface at github.com."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This option is a good for an initial import, but might become inconvenient over time. The `git` client or other Git-friendly tool is recommended."
