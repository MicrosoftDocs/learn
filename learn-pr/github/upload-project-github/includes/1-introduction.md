GitHub is home to millions of software projects with more joining every day. There are so many great reasons to host your project on GitHub, but getting your project up and running may seem like a big undertaking.

Suppose you are working on a software project that is starting to really take shape. Other people want to contribute, and it would be great to get their help. However, you still want to maintain control over the direction of the project, but in a way that doesn't slow down other people from improving it. GitHub offers you all of this and more.

In this module, you learn how to prepare and upload a project to GitHub.

> [!NOTE]
> If you are uploading a project that is already hosted in a version control system, consider completing [Migrate your repository by using GitHub best practices](/learn/modules/migrate-repository-github) instead.
