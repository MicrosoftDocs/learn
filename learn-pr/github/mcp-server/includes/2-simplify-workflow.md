AI is reshaping how developers work but making AI tools available across all environments can be challenging. GitHub MCP Server solves this by giving you a simple, scalable way to integrate GitHub Copilot to your code, along with related tools, and workflows.

Built on the Model Context Protocol (MCP), the GitHub MCP server removes setup friction and unlocks powerful capabilities from issue triage to semantic search across web, mobile, and desktop.

In this unit, you'll learn:

- What is MCP?

- Why should you use GitHub MCP Server?

- How does GitHub MCP Server work in action?


## What is MCP?

MCP (Model Context Protocol) is like a USB-C standard for your AI tools, providing a consistent and secure way for AI models to connect to the tools and data sources they need. 

MCP offers:

- Access to a growing library of tools that your AI models can use immediately.

- Flexibility to work with different AI providers while keeping your workflows consistent.

- Integration into your existing development environment and processes.

### How MCP clients connect to servers and services

The above diagram illustrates three common ways that an MCP Client (such as Claude, an IDE, or another tool) can interact with MCP Servers and the services they connect to. Each path shows a different type of communication, depending on whether the resources are local or remote.

#### Local communication with local data (top path)

In this scenario, the MCP Client talks directly to an MCP Server running on your machine using the MCP Protocol. That server then connects to a local data source (for example, files, databases, or other resources stored on your computer).

**When to use it**: This setup is useful for local development, or anytime you want fast access to data that stays private on your machine.

#### Local server as a bridge to remote services (middle path)

Here, the MCP Client still connects to an MCP Server running locally. But instead of working only with local data, this server bridges to a remote service on the internet by calling its Web APIs.

**When to use it**: This model is common when a local tool needs to fetch or update information from a remote service but benefits from having a local server in between—for example, to handle caching, security checks, or data preprocessing.

#### Remote communication over the internet (bottom path)

In the final setup, the MCP Client connects to an MCP Server that lives entirely on the internet (not on your machine). That remote server then communicates with other external services via Web APIs.

**When to use it**: This approach is best when the resource or computation you need can't happen locally—like using cloud-based compute, SaaS platforms, or third-party integrations that only exist online.

## Why use GitHub MCP Server?

Let's first understand why GitHub MCP Server matters for your workflow. Using local MCP servers typically requires Docker, token management, and manual configuration, which can slow down your setup and block integration with web clients like GitHub.com. 

Connecting to the GitHub-hosted server is quick and easy with no need for docker or config files. You can use AI tools like GitHub Copilot chat across web and mobile to scale your projects as they grow. GitHub MCP Server supports secure enterprise sign-in and gives you access to advanced features like semantic code search and automated fixes to boost your workflow.

GitHub MCP Server benefits include:

- Eliminates the need for Docker or manual configuration files.

- Provides easy one-click OAuth login for fast authentication.

- Allows you to work seamlessly across web, desktop, and mobile environments.

- Supports enterprise identity providers such as Entra and Auth0 for secure authentication.

- Scales automatically to meet your usage needs.

## GitHub MCP Server in action

Now that you know the usefulness of MCP, let's explore how GitHub MCP Server puts it into action. GitHub MCP Server is an open-source server that connects GitHub Copilot and other AI tools directly to your repositories. It allows you to:

- Analyze and summarize your code to better understand your projects.

- Create and manage issues and pull requests.

- Automate repository triage and task tracking to save time.

Currently, GitHub MCP Server offers over 30 tools, enabling you to:

- Add issues, edit files, and create branches easily.

- Rank pull requests and issues to identify priorities.
