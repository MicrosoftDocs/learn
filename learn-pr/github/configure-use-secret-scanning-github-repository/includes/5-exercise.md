- **What you'll learn**: How to identify plain-text credentials in your repository and how to prevent them from being written in the first place
- **Prerequisites**: Basics of git and GitHub functionality
- **Timing**: This course takes less than 15 minutes to complete

Here are some helpful tips before you begin the exercise:
