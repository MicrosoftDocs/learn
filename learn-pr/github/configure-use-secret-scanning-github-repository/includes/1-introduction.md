GitHub's security features help keep code and secrets secure in repositories and across organizations. Some features are available for all repositories, while others are only available for public repositories and for private repositories with a GitHub Advanced Security license.

Imagine that you're the administrator of a GitHub project involving several repositories that communicate with multiple external services. You'd like to make sure that no authentication credentials for these services get committed in the repositories of the project. Luckily, your company just purchased a GitHub Advanced Security license that includes secret scanning, a GitHub feature that does just that! You'd like to configure and use secret scanning for your project, but first you really need to understand what secret scanning is, how it works, and the options available to you according to your use case.

In this module, you'll learn about:

- How secret scanning works and to whom it's available.
- How to configure secret scanning according to your use case.
- How to use secret scanning efficiently.
