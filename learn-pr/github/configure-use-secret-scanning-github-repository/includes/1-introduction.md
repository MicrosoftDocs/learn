GitHub's security features help keep code and secrets secure in repositories and across organizations. Some features are available for all repositories while others are only available for public repositories and for private repositories with a GitHub Advanced Security license.

Imagine that you are the administrator of a GitHub project involving several repositories that communicate with multiple external services. You would like to make sure that no authentication credentials for these services get committed in the repositories of the project. Luckily, your company just purchased a GitHub Advanced Security license that includes secret scanning, a GitHub feature that does just that!
