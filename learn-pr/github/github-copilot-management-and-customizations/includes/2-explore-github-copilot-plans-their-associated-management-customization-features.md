When you're selecting a GitHub Copilot pricing plan, you and your organization should consider these key factors:

- **Data privacy and security**: The plans offer varying levels of data privacy and security measures. For instance, GitHub Copilot Business and Enterprise are the only plans that provide more robust privacy controls. These controls include the ability to exclude specific files from GitHub Copilot analysis, access detailed audit logs, and provide IP indemnity.
- **Policy management**: The ability to manage Copilot policies at an organizational level is crucial. Business and Enterprise plans allow for comprehensive policy management, to help ensure that sensitive data is handled according to the organization's privacy policies.
- **Data collection and retention**: Understanding how data is collected and retained is essential for compliance with data privacy regulations. Individual subscribers can choose whether GitHub collects and retains their prompts and Copilot suggestions.
- **IP indemnity and data privacy**: For businesses and enterprises, IP indemnity and data privacy are critical to avoiding legal, security, and customer issues. Evaluating the need for these features can help determine the most suitable pricing plan for your business.
