  - Describe the agent's built-in protections, main risks, mitigations, and its workflow and compatibility limits.
  - Assign issues to Copilot, track its pull-request sessions, iterate with @copilot comments, and troubleshoot problems.
  - Preconfigure the agent's environment, extend its capabilities with MCP, and test and validate its output before merging.
