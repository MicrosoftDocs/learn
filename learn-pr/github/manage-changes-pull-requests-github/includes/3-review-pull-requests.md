This exercise checks your knowledge on using pull requests to request, review, and incorporate changes to your source repository.

## Getting started

Select the _Start the exercise on GitHub_ button to navigate to a public GitHub template repository that prompts you to complete a series of small challenges. Before you can begin the exercise, complete the below tasks:

- Select the _Start course_ button or the _Use this template_ feature within the template repository. This prompts you to create a new repository. We recommend creating a public repository since private repositories use Actions minutes. After you make your own repository from the template, wait about 20 seconds and refresh.

- Follow the instructions in the repository's *README* file to understand how the exercise works, its learning objectives, and how to successfully complete the exercise.

After you finish the exercise in GitHub, return here for:
