Change is inevitable, especially in software repositories. Project improvements often require the coordination of many people working together in parallel to produce the right output. Responsibly tracking and merging those changes has always been a substantial challenge.

Suppose your team uses GitHub to manage version control for your expanding project. As the size of the codebase grows, it can be harder and harder to maintain high code quality and change visibility. However, introducing more process into software development can often drag down everyone's productivity. Fortunately, pull requests offer the right balance of control and convenience. Whether you're interested in making changes, reviewing changes, or understanding the impact of changes across the repository, pull requests are the way GitHub users collaborate on code.

In this module, you learn how to manage changes to your repository source by using pull requests.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you will:

- Create a pull request
- Comment on pull requests

- Request pull request reviews
- Accept changes introduced by a pull request review

## Prerequisites

- A GitHub account
- The ability to navigate and edit files in GitHub

It is recommended that you complete [Manage software delivery by using a release based workflow on GitHub](/learn/modules/release-based-workflow-github) before beginning this module.
