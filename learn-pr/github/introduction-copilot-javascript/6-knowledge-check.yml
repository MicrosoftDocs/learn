  - content: "Identify which statement is valid and select the correct answer:"
    choices:
    - content: "A prompt, which is our output, is a collection of songs that tells our copilot what to generate."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "False. A prompt isn't a collection of songs."
    - content: "A prompt, which is our input, is a collection of instructions or guidelines that tell our copilot what to generate."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "A prompt is crucial in eliciting specific responses from Copilot.  The prompt might be a comment that steers Copilot to generate code on your behalf or writing code that Copilot autocompletes."
    - content: "A prompt, which is our document, is a collection of laptops that tells our Copilot what to generate."
