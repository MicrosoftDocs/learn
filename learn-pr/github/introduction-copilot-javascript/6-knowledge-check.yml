    choices:
    - content: "It's a free unrestricted AI tool that works independent of code editors."
      isCorrect: false

    choices:
    - content: "Press the `Tab` key."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Copilot offers you a suggestion, which appears as grey code if you use black as your text color. To accept the suggestion, you need to press the `Tab` key."
    - content: "Press `F1` key."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "False. This option doesn't work to accept GitHub Copilot suggestions."

  - content: "Identify which statement is valid and select the correct answer:"
    choices:
    - content: "A prompt, which is our output, is a collection of songs that tells GitHub Copilot what to generate."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "False. A prompt isn't a collection of songs."
    - content: "A prompt, which is our input, is a collection of instructions or guidelines that tell GitHub Copilot what to generate."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "A prompt is crucial in eliciting specific responses from Copilot. The prompt might be a comment that steers Copilot to generate code on your behalf or writing code that Copilot autocompletes."
    - content: "A prompt, which is a separate document, is a collection of instructions that tells GitHub Copilot what to generate."
