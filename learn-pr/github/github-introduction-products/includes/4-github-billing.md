Now let's review billing and payments for your GitHub account.

GitHub bills separately for each account. This means that you receive a separate bill for your personal account and for each organization or enterprise account you own.

The bill for each account is a combination of charges for your subscriptions and usage-based billing.

- **Subscriptions** include your account's plan, such as GitHub Pro or GitHub Team, as well as paid products that have a consistent monthly cost, such as GitHub Copilot and apps from GitHub Marketplace.
- **Usage-based billing** applies when the cost of a paid product depends on how much you use the product. For example, the cost of GitHub Actions depends on how many minutes your jobs spend running and how much storage your artifacts use.
  - Note:  Your plan may come with included amounts of usage-based products. For example, with GitHub Pro, your personal account gets 3,000 minutes of GitHub Actions usage for free each month. You can control usage beyond the included amounts by setting spending limits.
