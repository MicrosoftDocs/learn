    choices:
    - content: "Requires on-premises deployment and infrastructure management"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This describes GitHub Enterprise Server (GHES), not GHEC. GHEC is hosted and managed by GitHub in the cloud."
    - content: "Provides centralized user management with identity provider integration"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "GHEC supports centralized user management and integrates with identity providers using SAML (for SSO) and SCIM (for user provisioning), which is a key feature of cloud-hosted enterprise solutions."
    - content: "Must be installed and maintained by the organization's IT team"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. GHEC is maintained by GitHub and requires no installation or infrastructure management by the organization."
    - content: "Operates entirely within a private cloud environment"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. GHEC operates in GitHubâ€™s public cloud infrastructure, not a private cloud."
  - content: "What actions can you take at enterprise level to manage the use of GitHub Actions in your enterprise instance?"
    choices:
    - content: "Create workflow templates"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Workflow templates are created at organizational level."
    - content: "Configure a GitHub Actions use policy"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. GitHub Actions use policies enable you to restrict access to GitHub Actions to specific organizations in your instance."
    - content: "Manually sync public actions in Enterprise Cloud"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Public actions are automatically synced in Enterprise Cloud. Only with Enterprise Server do you have the possibility to manually sync public actions instead of automatically."

    - content: "Add proxy configurations to your runners after they start."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. If you need a self-hosted runner to communicate with GitHub via a proxy server, you must add all proxy configurations to your runner before starting it."
    - content: "Add the IP address or IP address range of your runners at repository level."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. If your organization has configured an IP allowlist, you must add the IP address or IP address range of your self-hosted runners to the IP allowlist. IP allowlists are found in an organization's Settings."
  - content: "What are encrypted secrets?"
    choices:
    - content: "Encrypted secrets are authentication tokens you can generate in your account settings."

      explanation: "Incorrect. SSH keys are also called SSH keys in GitHub."
    - content: "Encrypted secrets are encrypted environment variables you can create to store sensitive information."
