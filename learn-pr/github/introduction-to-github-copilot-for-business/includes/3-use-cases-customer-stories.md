GitHub Copilot improves developer productivity and happiness, reduces disruptions, improves flow, and increases the amount of time a developer spends doing satisfying work.

**Developers code faster**: In our survey, almost 90% of developers said they completed tasks faster with GitHub Copilot.

Coyote Logistics, a third-party logistics provider, utilized GitHub Copilot Business to save developers time and effort. They enabled them to focus on more high-value work and less on insignificant details. "It used to take me 20 or 30 minutes to write a Terraform configuration," Cloud Delivery Engineer Gavin Borgeson says. "Now it saves me 10 minutes." Once Borgeson writes the base configuration, GitHub Copilot for Business is able to fill in the rest of the details.

**Developers stay in the flow longer**: Of developers that were surveyed, 73% said GitHub Copilot helps them stay in the flow longer and more easily. It also helped 87% of developers preserve mental energy when working through repetitive tasks. Previous research underscored how draining context switching, interruptions, and repetitive work can be for developers.

Duolingo, the language-learning app, has a team of more than 300 developers that accelerated their workflow with their recent adoption of GitHub Copilot. The tool offers two ways for developers to receive suggestions. They can either write the code they want to use or write natural-language comments describing what they want the code to do.

Jonathan Burket, a senior engineering manager at Duolingo, explains that GitHub Copilot increased developer productivity by:

- Limiting context switching.
- Reducing the need to manually produce boilerplate code.
- Helping developers stay focused on solving complex business challenges.

"Boilerplate code is where Copilot is very, very effective. You can practically tab complete the basic class or function using Copilot," says Burket.

Consider developers who are new to working with a specific repository or framework. Burket estimates at least a 25% increase in developer speed. For those already familiar with that same codebase who can more quickly and easily create boilerplate code, a 10% increase is estimated.
