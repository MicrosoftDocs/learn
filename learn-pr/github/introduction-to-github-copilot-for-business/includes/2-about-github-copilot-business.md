GitHub Copilot Business builds the power of generative AI into an editor extension that suggests code in real time. It works with code and natural-language prompts to offer multiple suggestions that you can quickly accept or reject. GitHub Copilot learns alongside developers to adapt to individual coding styles and conventions. With GitHub Copilot, developers can use the editor of their choice, which includes Visual Studio, Neovim, VS Code, or JetBrains integrated development environments (IDEs).

GitHub Copilot Business focuses on making your organization more productive, secure, and fulfilled by enabling your developers to code faster and focus on more satisfying work.

Features in Copilot Business include:

- **A more powerful AI model**: New modeling algorithms improve the quality of code suggestions.
- **AI-based security vulnerability filtering**: GitHub Copilot Business automatically blocks common insecure code suggestions by targeting issues such as hard-coded credentials, SQL injections, and path injections.
- **VPN proxy support**: GitHub Copilot works with VPNs including self-signed certificates, allowing developers to use it in any working environment.
- **Simple sign-up**: Any company can quickly purchase Copilot Business licenses online and easily assign users, even if they don't use the GitHub platform for their source code.
