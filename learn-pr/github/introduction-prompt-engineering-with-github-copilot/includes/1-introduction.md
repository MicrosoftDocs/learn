GitHub Copilot, powered by OpenAI, is changing the game in software development by accelerating development workflows from initial code creation to production-ready implementations. GitHub Copilot can grasp the intricate details of your project through its training of data containing both natural language and billions of lines of source code from publicly available sources, including code in public GitHub repositories. This allows GitHub Copilot to provide you with more context-aware suggestions that help you rapidly deliver code changes and automate routine development tasks.

But to get the most out of GitHub Copilot and maximize your development velocity, you need to know about prompt engineering. Prompt engineering is how you tell GitHub Copilot what you need with precision and efficiency. The quality of the code it gives back, and how quickly you can iterate toward the perfect solution, depends on how clear and strategic your prompts are.

In this module, you'll learn about:

- Prompt engineering principles, best practices, and how GitHub Copilot learns from your prompts to provide context-aware responses that accelerate development cycles.
- Advanced prompting strategies including role prompting and chat history management to get better results with fewer iterations.
- The underlying flow of how GitHub Copilot processes user prompts to generate responses or code suggestions efficiently.
- The data flow for code suggestions and chat in GitHub Copilot.
- LLMs (Large Language Models) and their role in GitHub Copilot and prompting.
- How to craft effective prompts that optimize GitHub Copilot's performance, ensuring precision and relevance in every code suggestion while minimizing revision cycles.
- The intricate relationship between prompts and Copilot's responses to streamline your development workflow.
- How Copilot handles data from prompts in different situations, including secure transmission and content filtering.
