  questions:
  - content: "What are direct dependencies?"
    choices:
    - content: "Dependencies that are explicitly defined in the manifest or lock file."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Direct dependencies are explicitly defined in the manifest or lock file."
    - content: "Dependencies used by packages that are dependencies of your project."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Indirect dependencies are dependencies used by packages that are dependencies of your project."
    - content: "Dependencies that aren't referenced in the manifest file."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Vendored dependencies are checked into a specific repository but aren't referenced in a manifest file."
  - content: "When is a Dependabot alert generated?"
    choices:
    - content: "Whenever a new vulnerability is added to the GitHub Advisory Database."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Dependabot alerts are generated under two conditions: a new vulnerability is added to the GitHub Advisory Database and the dependency graph for a repository changes."
    - content: "Whenever a pull request attempts to merge changes into the main branch that contain no dependency changes."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "GitHub can review when a pull request attempts to merge changes into the main branch that contain dependency changes. A Dependabot alert is generated if this change would introduce a vulnerability."
    - content: "Whenever a new vulnerability is removed from the GitHub Advisory Database."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "New vulnerabilities removed from the GitHub Advisory Database don't generate Dependabot alerts."
  - content: "What is a prerequisite for Dependabot to automatically enable security updates for a repository?"
    choices:
    - content: "Repository is public."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "GitHub automatically enables Dependabot security updates for every public repository. It also enables security updates for private repositories where you have enabled read-only analysis by the dependency graph, and vulnerability alerts in the repository's settings."
    - content: "Repository is a fork."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "GitHub doesn't automatically enable Dependabot security updates for forked repositories."
    - content: "Repository is archived."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "GitHub automatically enables Dependabot security updates for every repository that isn't archived."
  - content: "What query can you use to view all the notifications you've marked as done?"
    choices:
    - content: "`is:done`"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "To view all of your notifications marked as 'Done', use the `is:done` query."
    - content: "`is:saved`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "To view all of your saved notifications, use the `is:saved` query."
    - content: "`is:complete`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The `is:complete` query doesn't exist on GitHub."
