This hands-on exercise guides you on using GitHub to manage your dependencies.

### Secure your repository's supply chain

GitHub helps you secure your supply chain, from understanding the dependencies in your environment to knowing about vulnerabilities in those dependencies and patching them.

- **Who this is for**: Developers, DevOps Engineers, Site Reliability Engineers, Security practitioners
- **What you'll learn**: How to view repository dependencies, view Dependabot alerts, and enable Dependabot security and version updates
- **What you'll build**: Repository dependencies, Dependabot alerts, pull requests to fix dependencies and version updates
- **Prerequisites**: None
- **Timing**: This course can be completed in under an hour

Here are some helpful tips before you begin the exercise:

1. After you open the exercise repository, right-click **Start course** and open the link in a new tab.
2. In the new tab, most of the prompts will automatically fill in for you.
   - For owner, choose your personal account or an organization to host the repository.
   - We recommend creating a public repository, as private repositories will [use Actions minutes](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-github-actions/about-billing-for-github-actions).
   - Scroll down and select the **Create repository** button at the bottom of the form.
3. After your new repository is created, wait about 20 seconds, then refresh the page. Follow the step-by-step instructions in the new repository's README.
