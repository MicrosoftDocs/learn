Now you know how Dependabot alerts can help you identify vulnerable dependencies in your repository, and you're ready to learn about security updates and version updates. Dependabot security updates help you to fix the vulnerabilities that Dependabot alerts identify. Version updates help manage different versions of dependent packages.

Once you've set up Dependabot alerts to notify you of vulnerabilities in your repository, you can enable two related features so that Dependabot automatically raises pull requests to try to help with your dependency management:

- **Dependabot security updates** are automated pull requests that help you update dependencies with known vulnerabilities.
- **Dependabot version updates** are automated pull requests that keep your dependencies updated, even when they donâ€™t have any vulnerabilities.

## Supported repositories

GitHub automatically enables Dependabot security updates for every repository that meets the following prerequisites:

- The repository isn't a fork.
- The repository isn't archived.
- The repository is public, or it's private and you've enabled the read-only analysis in the dependency graph and vulnerability alerts in the repository's settings.
- Dependabot security updates aren't disabled for the repository.

## Manually enable security updates

You can enable security updates manually on private repositories that don't meet the prerequisites mentioned in the preceding section. Make sure you've enabled the dependency graph and Dependabot alerts on your repository, then follow these steps to manually enable security updates:

1. Sign in to your GitHub account and select your profile photo from the upper-right.
2. Select **Settings** > **Code security and analysis**.
3. Select **Enable** for Dependabot security updates.

## View and resolve security updates

You can view Dependabot pull requests the same way that you'd view other pull requests on GitHub, within the **Pull requests** tab of the related repository. Dependabot pull requests will have dependabot as the author; this account is the bot account Dependabot uses. These pull requests also use the `dependencies` label.

Dependabot pull requests include all the information that you need to review and merge a proposed fix into your project, like release notes, changelog entries, and commit details. Details of which vulnerability a pull request resolves are hidden from anyone who doesn't have access to Dependabot alerts for the repository. Merging a security update pull request automatically closes the related Dependabot alert.

Despite all this information, it's still best practice to have automated processes in place so that checks are carried out before the pull request is merged. This approach is especially important if the update includes other functionality or potentially breaking changes.

### View dependencies being monitored by Dependabot

After creating and checking your `dependabot.yml` file into your repository, you can view the dependencies Dependabot is monitoring to confirm everything is working properly by following these steps:

1. Go to the repository's main page.
2. Under your repository name, select the **Insights** tab.
3. Select **Dependency graph** in the left sidebar.
4. Select the **Dependabot** tab.
5. Select the **...** next to a package manager to view the files being monitored.

The **Last checked TIME ago** link in the **Dependabot** tab also enables you to see the log files that Dependabot generated during the last check for version updates. You can rerun the version check by selecting the **Check for updates** button.

## Version updates

Version updates are another Dependabot feature that helps to manage your dependencies by automatically generating a pull request whenever there's a new version of a package or application that your project depends on.

Dependabot checks for new versions by looking at the semantic versioning of the dependency (`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` naming convention), which is included in a manifest or other type of package definition file stored in your repository. To enable version updates, you need to create a `dependabot.yml` file, which essentially tells Dependabot where to find the manifest or other package-definition file. You'll learn how to create a `dependabot.yml` file in the next section.

### Enable version updates for private repositories

Users with write permissions can enable Dependabot version updates for their repository by checking a `dependabot.yml` file into the `.github` directory of their repository.

The `dependabot.yml` file should include the following information:

- `version`: Should be set to 2.
- `registries`: Optional if you have dependencies in a private registry. This section contains authentication details.
- `updates`: Include an entry for each dependency you want Dependabot to monitor.

For each package manager, include:

- `package-ecosystem`: Specifies the package manager.
- `directory`: Specifies the location of the manifest or other definition files.
- `schedule.interval`: Specifies how often to check for new versions.

Here's an example of a `dependabot.yml` file:

```yaml
# Basic dependabot.yml file with
# minimum configuration for two package managers

version: 2
updates:
  # Enable version updates for npm
  - package-ecosystem: "npm"
    # Look for `package.json` and `lock` files in the `root` directory
    directory: "/"
    # Check the npm registry for updates every day (weekdays)
    schedule:
      interval: "daily"

  # Enable version updates for Docker
  - package-ecosystem: "docker"
    # Look for a `Dockerfile` in the `root` directory
    directory: "/"
    # Check for updates once a week
    schedule:
      interval: "weekly"
```

### Version updates on forks

Dependabot version updates aren't automatically enabled on forks. This safeguard prevents fork owners from unintentionally enabling version updates when they pull changes including a `dependabot.yml` file from the original repository.

To enable version updates on the fork of a repository:

1. Go to the main page of the repository where you want to enable version updates.
2. Select **Insights**.
3. Select **Dependency graph** from the left sidebar.
4. Select **Dependabot**.
5. Select **Enable Dependabot**.

## Allow Dependabot to access private repositories

To check for outdated dependencies and generate a security update, Dependabot must have access to the repository that contains the dependencies. Dependabot generally can't update dependencies that are located in private repositories or private package registries. However, if the dependency is in a private repository located in the same organization as the package that uses it, then you can grant Dependabot access.

To allow Dependabot to access a private GitHub repository:

1. Go to your organization page, then select **Settings** > **Code security and analysis**.
2. Under **Grant Dependabot access to private repository**, select **Add private repositories** or **Add internal and private repositories**.
3. Start typing the name of the repository you want to allow.
4. Select the repository you want to allow.
5. Optionally, to remove a repository from the list, go to the right of the repository and select **X**.

## Security update compatibility scores

Dependabot security updates might include compatibility scores to let you know whether updating a dependency could cause breaking changes. This score is calculated from continuous integration (CI) tests in other public repositories where the same security update has been generated. The compatibility score is the percentage of CI runs that passed when updating between specific versions of the dependency.
