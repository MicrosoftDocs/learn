This exercise will help walk you through writing your own GitHub JavaScript Action and automating customized tasks unique to your workflow.

## Getting started

When you select the _Start the exercise on GitHub_ button, you'll navigate to a public GitHub template repository that prompts you to complete a series of small challenges. Before you can begin the exercise, complete the following tasks:

- Select the _Start course_ button or the _Use this template_ feature within the template repository. This prompts you to create a new repository. We recommend creating a public repository, because private repositories will use Actions minutes.

    After you make your own repository from the template, wait about 20 seconds and refresh.

- Follow the instructions in the repository's README to understand how the exercise works, its learning objectives, and how to successfully complete the exercise.

When you've finished the exercise in GitHub, return here for:
