Your goal in this module was to understand the different types of GitHub actions and then create your own custom GitHub action and use it in a workflow.

To accomplish this goal, you first learned about the necessary metadata and syntax to write custom GitHub actions. You learned about workflow commands to extend functionality to your action, how to choose a private or public location for your action, and establishing best practices for documenting and versioning your action. You also learned how to publish your action to the GitHub Marketplace.

Next, you learned how GitHub Actions behave when consuming external APIs, and you also used the response from an external API as an `output:` parameter for a later step in the workflow. Lastly, you saw how to use actions to interact with a repository by creating an issue, using multiple packages in your action source code, and how to use the `@actions/core package` to write errors and terminate a misbehaving action.
