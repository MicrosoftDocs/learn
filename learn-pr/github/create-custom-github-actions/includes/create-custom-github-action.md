GitHub Actions is a powerful feature that helps you to go from code to cloud, all from the comfort and convenience of your own repository. Here, you'll learn about the different types of GitHub actions and the metadata, syntax, and workflow commands to create custom GitHub actions. 

## Types of GitHub actions

Actions are individual tasks that you can use to customize your development workflows. You can create your own actions by writing custom code that interacts with your repository to perform custom tasks, or by using actions the GitHub community shares. Navigating through various actions, you'll notice that there are three different types of actions: _Docker container actions_, _JavaScript actions_, and _composite run steps actions_. Let's take a closer look at each action type.

### Docker container actions

Docker containers package the environment with the GitHub Actions code. This means that the action runs in a consistent and reliable environment because all of its dependencies are within that container. If the action needs to run in a specific environment configuration, Docker containers are a good way to go because you can customize the operating system and tools. The downside is that because the job has to build and retrieve the container, Docker container actions are often slower than JavaScript actions.

Before building a Docker container action, you should have some basic understanding of how to use environment variables and the Docker container filesystem. The steps to take to build a Docker container action are then minimal and straightforward:

1. Create a `Dockerfile` to define the commands to assemble the Docker image.
2. Create an `action.yml` metadata file to define the inputs and outputs of the action. Set the `runs: using:` value to `docker` and the `runs: image:` value to `Dockerfile` in the file.
3. Create an `entrypoint.sh` file to describe the docker image.
4. Commit and push your action to GitHub with the following files: `action.yml`, `entrypoint.sh`, `Dockerfile`, and `README.md`.

### JavaScript actions

JavaScript actions can run directly on the runner machine, and separate the action code from the environment that's used to run the action. Because of this, the action code is simplified and can execute faster than actions within a Docker container.

As a prerequisite for creating and using packaged JavaScript actions, you need to download Node.js, which includes npm. As an optional step (but one that we recommend) is to use GitHub Actions Toolkit Node.js, which is a collection of Node.js packages that allows you to quickly build JavaScript actions with more consistency.

The steps to build a JavaScript action are minimal and straightforward:

1. Create an `action.yml` metadata file to define the inputs and outputs of the action, as well as tell the action runner how to start running this JavaScript action.
2. Create an `index.js` file with context information about the Toolkit packages, routing, and other functions of the action.
3. Commit and push your action to GitHub with the following files: `action.yml`, `index.js`, `node_modules`, `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, and `README.md`.

### Composite run steps actions

Composite run steps actions allow you to reuse actions by using shell scripts. You can even mix multiple shell languages within the same action. If you have many shell scripts to automate several tasks, you can now easily turn them into an action and reuse them for different workflows. Sometimes it's easier to just write a shell script than using JavaScript or wrapping your code in a Docker container.

## Metadata and syntax needed to create an action

When creating or reviewing a GitHub action, a great first step is to review the `action.yml` file to assess which inputs, outputs, description, runs, and other configuration information the action needs. Some of these parameters are required, while others are optional. The `action.yml` file defines the following information about your action:

| Parameter   | Description                                                                                                                                            |      Required      |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :----------------: |
| Name        | The name of your action. Helps visually identify the action in a job.                                                                                 | yes |
| Description | A summary of what your action does.                                                                                                                    | yes |
| Inputs      | Input parameters enable you to specify data that the action expects to use during runtime. These parameters become environment variables in the runner. |         no         |
| Outputs     | Output parameters enable you to specify data that subsequent actions can use later in the workflow after the action that defines these outputs has run.                          |         no         |
| Runs        | The command to run when the action executes.                                                                                                           | yes |
| Branding    |  Color and Feather icon to use to create a badge to personalize and distinguish your action in GitHub Marketplace.                               |         no         |

### Inputs

Inputs are the parameters that allow you to specify data that the action expects to use during its runtime. GitHub stores these input parameters as environment variables.

Following is an example of a list of inputs for an action. The `firstNameStudent` input is optional, while the `studentGrade` input is required.

```yml
inputs:
  firstNameStudent:
    description: 'First name of student'
    required: false
    default: '1'
  studentGrade:
    description: 'Grade of the student'
    required: true
```

### Outputs

Outputs are the parameters that allow you to declare data. Keep in mind that actions that run later in a workflow can use the output data that was declared in a previously run action.

The following example is a simple output to declare the average grade of the students:

```yml
outputs:
  average:
    description: 'The average grade of the students'
```

### Runs

As you learned previously, your action needs to have a `runs` statement that defines the command necessary to execute your action. Depending on how you're creating your action—whether you're using a Docker container, JavaScript, or composite run steps—the `runs` syntax is defined differently.

#### `runs` for Docker actions

Docker container actions require the `runs` statement to configure the image the Docker action uses with the following arguments:

- `using`: Needs to be set to `docker` to run a Docker container action.
- `image`: Docker image used as the container to run the action.

```yml
runs:
  using: 'docker'
  image: 'Dockerfile'
```

#### `runs` for JavaScript actions

JavaScript actions require that the `runs` statement take the following two arguments:

- `using`: Application used to execute the code as defined in `main`.
- `main`: File that contains the action code; the application defined in `using` executes this file.

For example, here's a `runs` statement for a JavaScript action using Node.js:

```yml
runs:
  using: 'node12'
  main: 'main.js'
```

#### `runs` for composite run steps actions

Composite run steps actions require that the `runs` statement take the following three arguments:

- `using`: Needs to be set to `"composite"` to run a composite run step.
- `steps`: Run steps to run the action.
- `steps[*].run`: Command you want to run (can be inline or a script in your action repository).

For example, here's a `runs` statement for a composite run steps action that will run the script at filepath `/test/script/sh`:

```yml
runs:
  using: "composite"
  steps:
    - run: ${{ github.action_path }}/test/script.sh
      shell: bash
```

### Branding

An optional but fun feature is the ability to customize the badge of your action. The badge is displayed next to the action name in the [GitHub Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace?type=actions). You can use a color and [Feather](https://feathericons.com/) icon to create the badge. For branding, you'll need to specify the icon and color you wish to use.

```yml
branding:
  icon: 'shield'  
  color: 'blue'
```

Here's an example of a Checkout action badge on the GitHub Marketplace:

## Workflow commands

Creating a workflow is pretty straightforward as long as you can find the right actions for your steps. In some cases, you might need to create your own actions to achieve your desired outcomes, but you can use workflow commands to add another level of customization to your workflows.

Workflow commands allow you to communicate with the GitHub Actions runner machine by printing formatted lines of text to the console. You can use these workflow commands with shell commands or within your custom actions. Workflow commands are useful because they let you share information between workflow steps, print debug or error messages to the console, set environment variables, set output parameters, or add to the system path.

Most workflow commands use the `echo` command in the following specific format, while others can be invoked by writing to a file:

```bash
echo "::workflow-command parameter1={data},parameter2={data}::{command value}"
```

Following are some basic message-logging examples for printing a debug message, info message, error message, or warning message to the console:

```yml
- name: workflow commands logging messages
  run: |
    echo "::debug::This is a debug message"
    echo "This is an info message"
    echo "::error::This is an error message"
    echo "::warning::This is a warning message"
```

You can also create a message to print to the log with a filename (file), line number (line), and column (col) number where the error occurred. Warning messages appear in a yellow highlight with the text "warning," and error messages appear in a red highlight with the text "error."

```bash
echo "::error file=app.js,line=10,col=15::Something went wrong"
```

It's important to note that these workflow commands need to be on a single line. Characters that interfere with parsing, such as commas and line breaks, will need to be URL-encoded.

For example, the following text is a multi-line message:

```yml
This text spans
across multiple lines
```

This message should be encoded as shown here:

```yml
This text spans%0Aacross multiple lines
```

In addition to workflow commands, you can set exit codes to set the status of an action. This is important because when you're working with jobs in a workflow, a failed exit code will halt all concurrent actions and cancel any future actions. If you're creating a JavaScript action, you can use the actions toolkit `@actions/core` package to log a message and set a failure exit code. If you're creating a Docker container action, you can set a failure exit code in your `entrypoint.sh` script.
