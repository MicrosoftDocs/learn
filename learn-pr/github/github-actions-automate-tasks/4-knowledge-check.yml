  questions:
  - content: "What are GitHub Actions used for?"
    choices:
    - content: "To automate software development tasks"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "GitHub Actions are used to automate software development tasks, but they also facilitate CI/CD and integrate IaC."
    - content: "To facilitate continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD)."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "GitHub Actions are used to facilitate CI/CD, but they also automate software development tasks and integrate IaC."
    - content: "To integrate infrastructure as code within your project's context."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "GitHub Actions can integrate infrastructure as code within your project's context, but they can also facilitate CI/CD and integrate IaC."
    - content: "All of these functions."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "GitHub Actions can integrate infrastructure as code within your project's context, facilitate CI/CD, and integrate IaC."
  - content: "What are the three types of GitHub actions?"
    choices:
    - content: "Container actions, JavaScript actions, and composite actions"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "With container actions, the environment is part of the action's code. JavaScript actions don't include the environment in the code. Composite actions allow you to combine multiple workflow steps within one action."
    - content: "Embedded actions, composite actions, and container actions"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Container actions, JavaScript actions, and composite actions. With container actions, the environment is part of the action's code. JavaScript actions don't include the environment in the code. Composite actions allow you to combine multiple workflow steps within one action."
    - content: "Workflows, triggers, and composite actions"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Container actions, JavaScript actions, and composite actions. With container actions, the environment is part of the action's code. JavaScript actions don't include the environment in the code. Composite actions allow you to combine multiple workflow steps within one action."
  - content: "Which of the following actions could *not* be used as an event trigger ```(on:)```?" 
    choices:
    - content: "Making a commit"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Event triggers use Git references, and a Git reference is produced when you make a commit."
    - content: "Opening a new tab in your browser"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Event triggers use Git references, and opening a tab doesn't produce a Git reference."
    - content: "Merging a branch"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Event triggers use Git references, and merging a branch produces a Git reference."
    - content: "Opening an issue"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Event triggers use Git references, and opening an issue produces a Git reference."
  - content: "What are the two types of manual events that can trigger a GitHub Actions workflow?"
    choices:
    - content: "workflow_run and repository_run"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "workflow_run is an event that triggers when another workflow completes, not a manual event. repository_run is not a valid GitHub Actions event."
    - content: "workflow_dispatch and repository_dispatch"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "GitHub Actions supports these two manual event triggers: workflow_dispatch allows manual triggering from the GitHub UI or API with customizable input parameters, and repository_dispatch enables workflows to be triggered by external systems via POST requests to the GitHub API."
    - content: "manual_run and external_trigger"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Neither manual_run nor external_trigger are valid GitHub Actions event types."
    - content: "workflow_trigger and repository_webhook"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "workflow_trigger doesn't exist in GitHub Actions. While repository_webhook sounds similar to webhooks, the correct term for the external API-triggered event is repository_dispatch."
  - content: "What is the primary benefit of using GitHub's larger hosted runners?"
    choices:
    - content: "They provide additional CPU and memory resources for running more demanding jobs."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Larger runners offer increased CPU and memory, allowing you to run workflows that require more resources than standard runners provide."
    - content: "GitHub's larger runners are available at no additional cost beyond standard runners."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Larger runners incur additional costs based on their usage, unlike standard runners which may be included in your plan."
    - content: "Larger runners come with completely different pre-installed tools compared to standard runners."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "These larger runners maintain compatibility with existing workflows by including the same preinstalled tools as standard `ubuntu-latest` runners."
    - content: "Repository-level policies cannot be configured to control access to larger runners."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "To control access to larger runners, you can configure repository or organization-level policies, helping you manage costs and access effectively."
