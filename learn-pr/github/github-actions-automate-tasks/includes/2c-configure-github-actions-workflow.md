Here, you'll learn some common configurations within a workflow file. You'll also explore the categories of event types, disabling and deleting workflows, and using specific versions of an action for security best practices. 

## Configure workflows to run for scheduled events

As mentioned previously, you can configure your workflows to run when specific activity occurs on GitHub, when an event outside of GitHub happens, or at a scheduled time. The `schedule` event allows you to trigger a workflow to run at specific UTC times using [POSIX cron syntax](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/crontab.html#tag_20_25_07). This cron syntax has five `*` fields, and each field represents a unit of time.

:::image type="content" source="../media/scheduled-events.png" alt-text="Diagram of the five unit-of-time fields for scheduling an event in a workflow file." border="false":::

For example, if you wanted to run a workflow every 15 minutes, the `schedule` event would look like the following:

```yml
on:
  schedule:
    - cron:  '*/15 * * * *'
```

And if you wanted to run a workflow every Sunday at 3:00am, the `schedule` event would look like this:


```yml
on:
  schedule:
    - cron:  '0 3 * * SUN'
```

You can also use operators to specify a range of values or to dial in your scheduled workflow. The shortest interval you can run scheduled workflows is once every five minutes, and they run on the latest commit on the default or base branch.

## Configure workflows to run for manual events

In addition to scheduled events, you can manually trigger a workflow by using the `workflow_dispatch` event. This event allows you to run the workflow by using the GitHub REST API or by selecting the **Run workflow** button in the **Actions** tab within your repository on GitHub. Using `workflow_dispatch`, you can choose on which branch you want the workflow to run, as well as set optional `inputs` that GitHub will present as form elements in the UI.

```yml
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      logLevel:
        description: 'Log level'     
        required: true
        default: 'warning'
      tags:
        description: 'Test scenario tags'  
```

In addition to `workflow_dispatch`, you can use the GitHub API to trigger a webhook event called `repository_dispatch`. This event allows you to trigger a workflow for activity that occurs outside of GitHub. It essentially serves as an HTTP request to your repository asking GitHub to trigger a workflow off an action or webhook. Using this manual event requires you to do two things: send a `POST` request to the GitHub endpoint `/repos/{owner}/{repo}/dispatches` with the webhook event names in the request body, and configure your workflow to use the `repository_dispatch` event.

```bash
curl \
  -X POST \
  -H "Accept: application/vnd.github.v3+json" \
  https://api.github.com/repos/octocat/hello-world/dispatches \
  -d '{"event_type":"event_type"}'
```

```yml
on:
  repository_dispatch:
    types: [opened, deleted]
```

## Configure workflows to run for webhook events

Lastly, you can configure a workflow to run when specific webhook events occur on GitHub. You can trigger most webhook events from more than one activity for a webhook. If multiple activities exist for a webhook, you can specify an activity type to trigger the workflow. For example, you can run a workflow for the `check_run` event, but only for the `rerequested` or `requested_action` activity types.

```yml
on:
  check_run:
    types: [rerequested, requested_action]
```

## Repository_dispatch
repository_dispatch is a custom event in GitHub Actions that allows external systems (or even other GitHub workflows) to manually trigger workflows by sending a POST request to the GitHub API.
It enables flexible automation and integration with outside tools, scripts, or systems that need to start workflows in your repo.

### Use Cases
- Trigger workflows from external CI/CD tools.

- Coordinate multi-repo deployments (e.g., Repo A finishes build â†’ triggers Repo B).

- Start automation based on external events (webhooks, monitoring alerts, CRON jobs outside GitHub).

- Chain workflow executions between repositories or within monorepos.

### Example Workflow That Listens to repository_dispatch
```yml
name: Custom Dispatch Listener

on:
  repository_dispatch:
    types: [run-tests, deploy-to-prod]  # Optional filtering

jobs:
  run:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Echo the payload
        run: |
          echo "Event type: ${{ github.event.action }}"
          echo "Payload value: ${{ github.event.client_payload.env }}"
```
### Key Elements:
- types: Optional. Defines custom event types like run-tests, deploy-to-prod, etc.

- github.event.client_payload: Access to any additional custom data passed in the dispatch event.

- github.event.action: Name of the event_type sent.

### Triggering the Event via API
You must send a POST request to the GitHub REST API v3 endpoint:
```sh
POST https://api.github.com/repos/OWNER/REPO/dispatches
```
#### Authorization
- Requires a personal access token (PAT) with repo scope.
- For organizations, ensure proper access settings for your token.

#### Sample command structure
```sh
curl -X POST \
  -H "Accept: application/vnd.github+json" \
  -H "Authorization: token YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN" \
  https://api.github.com/repos/OWNER/REPO/dispatches \
  -d '{"event_type":"run-tests","client_payload":{"env":"staging"}}'
```
#### Payload Structure
```json
{
  "event_type": "run-tests",
  "client_payload": {
    "env": "staging"
  }
}

```
#### Parameters
| Field        | Type                                              | Description |Required|
|----------------|----------------------------------------------------------|--------------|----------|
| `event_type`   | string                                          | A custom name for the event. This maps to the types value in your workflow trigger | Yes
| `client_payload`          | object               | Arbitrary JSON payload to send custom data to the workflow (github.event.client_payload) | No
                                                       |        No         |

## Use conditional keywords

Within your workflow file, you can access context information and evaluate expressions. Although expressions are commonly used with the conditional `if` keyword in a workflow file to determine whether a step should run or not, you can use any supported context and expression to create a conditional. It's important to know that when using conditionals in your workflow, you need to use the specific syntax `${{ <expression> }}`. This tells GitHub to evaluate an expression rather than treat it as a string.

For example, a workflow that uses the `if` conditional to check if the `github.ref` (the branch or tag ref that triggered the workflow run) matches `refs/heads/main`. In order to proceed, the workflow would look something like this:

```yml
name: CI
on: push
jobs:
  prod-check:
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      ...
```

Notice that in this example, the `${{ }}` are missing from the syntax. With some expressions, as in the case of the `if` conditional, you can omit the expression syntax. GitHub automatically evaluates some of these common expressions, but you can always include them in case you forget which expressions GitHub automatically evaluates.

## Disable and delete workflows

After adding a workflow to your repository, you might find a situation where you want to temporarily disable the workflow. You can stop a workflow from being triggered without having to delete the file from the repo, either on GitHub or through the GitHub REST API. When you wish to enable the workflow again, you can easily do it using the same methods.

:::image type="content" source="../media/disable-workflow.png" alt-text="Screenshot of disabling a workflow on GitHub.":::

Disabling a workflow can be useful in some of the following situations:

- An error on a workflow is producing too many or wrong requests impacting external services negatively.
- You want to temporarily pause a workflow that isn't critical and is consuming too many minutes on your account.
- You want to pause a workflow that's sending requests to a service that is down.
- You're working on a fork, and you don't need all the functionality of some workflows it includes (like scheduled workflows).

You can also cancel a workflow run that's in progress in the GitHub UI from the **Actions** tab or by using the GitHub API endpoint `DELETE /repos/{owner}/{repo}/actions/runs/{run_id}`. Keep in mind that when you cancel a workflow run, GitHub will cancel all of its jobs and steps within that run.

## Use an organization's templated workflow

If you have a workflow that multiple teams use within an organization, you don't need to re-create the same workflow for each repository. Instead, you can promote consistency across your organization by using a workflow template that's defined in the organization's `.github` repository. Any member within the organization can use an organization template workflow, and any repository within that organization has access to those template workflows.

You can find these workflows by navigating to the **Actions** tab of a repository within the organization, selecting **New workflow**, and then finding the organization's workflow template section titled "Workflows created by *organization name*". For example, the organization called Mona has a template workflow as shown here.

:::image type="content" source="../media/mona-workflow.png" alt-text="Screenshot of a template organization workflow called greet and triage by Mona.":::

## Use specific versions of an action

When referencing actions in your workflow, we recommend that you refer to a specific version of that action rather than just the action itself. By referencing a specific version, you're placing a safeguard from unexpected changes pushed to the action that could potentially break your workflow. Here are several ways you can reference a specific version of an action:

```yml
steps:    
  # Reference a specific commit
  - uses: actions/setup-node@c46424eee26de4078d34105d3de3cc4992202b1e
  # Reference the major version of a release
  - uses: actions/setup-node@v1
  # Reference a minor version of a release
  - uses: actions/setup-node@v1.2
  # Reference a branch
  - uses: actions/setup-node@main
```

Some references are safer than others. For example, referencing a specific branch will run that action off of the latest changes from that branch, which you may or may not want. By referencing a specific version number or commit SHA hash, you're being more specific about the version of the action you're running. For more stability and security, we recommend that you use the commit SHA of a released action within your workflows.
