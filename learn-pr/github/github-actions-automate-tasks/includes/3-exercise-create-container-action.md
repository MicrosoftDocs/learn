This exercise checks your knowledge on creating a GitHub Action and using it in a workflow.

## Getting started

When you select the **Start the exercise on GitHub** button, you'll be navigated to a public GitHub template repository that will prompt you to complete a series of small challenges. Before you can begin the exercise, complete the following tasks:

- Select the **Start course** button or the **Use this template** feature within the template repository. This prompts you to create a new repository. We recommend creating a public repository because private repositories will use Actions minutes.

    After you make your own repository from the template, wait about 20 seconds and refresh.

- Follow the instructions in the repository's README to understand how the exercise works, its learning objectives, and how to successfully complete the exercise.

When you've finished the exercise in GitHub, return here for:

>[!NOTE]
> You don't need to modify any of the workflow files to complete this exercise. **Altering the contents in this workflow can break the exercise's ability to validate your actions, provide feedback, or grade the results**.
