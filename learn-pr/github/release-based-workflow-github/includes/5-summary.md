In this module, you learned to implement a release based workflow on GitHub using project boards, branches, and releases.

You learned about:

- Building a project board to manage your next release
- Creating and commit changes on a release branch
- Creating a Git tag and a release on GitHub
- Resolving bugs after a release
- Automating and better documenting your release changes

Now that you have learned about release based workflows, learn to [Manage repository changes by using pull requests on GitHub](/learn/modules/manage-changes-pull-requests-github/).
