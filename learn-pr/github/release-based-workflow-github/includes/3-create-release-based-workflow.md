This exercise checks your knowledge on creating a release based workflow that is built on the foundations of the GitHub flow

## Getting started

When you click the _Start the exercise on GitHub_ button below, you'll be navigated to a public GitHub template repository that will prompt you to complete a series of small challenges. Before you can begin the exercise, complete the below tasks:

- Select the _Start course_ button or the _Use this template_ feature within the template repository. This will prompt you to create a new repository. We recommend creating a public repository, as private repositories will use Actions minutes.
After you make your own repository from the template, wait about 20 seconds and refresh.

- Follow the instructions in the repository's README to understand how the exercise works, its learning objectives, and how to successfully complete the exercise.

When you've finished the exercise in GitHub, return here for:
