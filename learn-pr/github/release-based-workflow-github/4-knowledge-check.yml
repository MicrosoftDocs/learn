    choices:
    - content: "You want to restrict who can push commits to it."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Protecting a branch is the best way to control who can write to it."
    - content: "You want to avoid accidental deletion after a pull request."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Protected branches can't be deleted."
    - content: "The branch contains sensitive information that you don't want other repository participants to be able to see."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Protecting a branch doesn't hide its contents."
  - content: "Suppose your team repository contains several long-lived branches, including `main`, `release-v1.0`, and `release-v2.0`. Which of the following Git commands best enables you to apply specific commits from `main` into `release-v1.0` to apply hotfixes to the legacy version of the codebase?"
    choices:
    - content: "`git merge`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This command doesn't allow you to specify commits. It attempts to merge the two branches entirely."
    - content: "`git cherry-pick`"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "This command allows you to select specific commits to apply to a different branch."
    - content: "`git rebase`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This command doesn't allow you to control which commits are applied in the way you need to here. Also, it isn't recommended for public branches because it can cause issues for others working on branches based on them."
  - content: "Your project team reaches a major milestone and wants everyone to install the latest version of your app. Which option is the **best** way to let interested users know?"
    choices:
    - content: "Create a release on GitHub."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "This option notifies everyone who is watching your repository. It also gives you the opportunity to provide binaries for deployment and emphasize the importance of the release through release notes."
    - content: "Create a Git tag."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This option only informs the limited number of people who are paying attention to changes in your project's tags. Also, many people might not understand the significance of this specific tag."
    - content: "Merge the changes into `main` using a pull request."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This option only informs the limited number of people who are paying attention to changes in your project's source. Also, many people might not understand the significance of this specific pull request."
