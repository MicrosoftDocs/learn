Creating a Space is simple but powerful—once named and configured, it becomes a reusable workspace where Copilot operates within a clearly defined scope. In this unit, you’ll walk through how to create your first Space, decide on ownership and visibility, and populate it with meaningful context. You'll also explore different ways of adding files, issues, and free-text notes to support precise, grounded interactions.

In this unit, you’ll learn:
- How to create a Space and name it clearly for discoverability
- The difference between personal and organization-owned Spaces
- How to add and structure context through attachments and instructions
- Why organization and clarity improve Copilot’s responses


## Creating a space

1. To create a space, go to <https://github.com/copilot/spaces>, and click Create space.
1. Give your space a name.
1. Choose whether the space is owned by you or by an organization you belong to. Organization-owned Spaces can be shared using GitHub's built-in permission model.
1. Optionally, add a description. This doesn't affect the responses Copilot gives in the space, but it can help others understand the context of the space.

    >[!NOTE]
    >You can change the name and description of your space at any time by clicking  Edit in the top right corner of the space.

1. Click Save in the top right corner of the page.

1. Adding context to a space
You can add two types of context to your space:

    Instructions: Free text that describes what Copilot should focus on within this space. Include its areas of expertise, what kinds of tasks it should help with, and what it should avoid. This helps Copilot give more relevant responses based on your intent.

**Attachments:** This context is used to provide more relevant answers to your questions. Additionally, Spaces always refer to the latest version of the code on the main branch of the repository.

To add attachments, click  Add to the right of "Attachments", then choose one of the following options:

- Attach files and folders: You can add files and folders from your GitHub repositories. This includes code files, documentation, and other relevant content that can help Copilot understand the context of your space.
- Link pull requests and issues: You can paste the URLs of the GitHub issues and pull requests.
- Upload a file: You can upload files directly from your local machine. This includes images, text files, rich documents, and spreadsheets.
- Add text content: You can type or paste free-text content, such as transcripts, notes, or any other relevant information that can help Copilot understand the context of your space.

Congratulations! You just create a Space!
