## How to improve GitHub Copilot Chat responses
You can significantly improve the quality and relevance of GitHub Copilot Chat's responses with certain key features. Let's dive into them.

### Scope referencing

To enhance the accuracy and relevance of the responses provided by GitHub Copilot Chat, it’s important to properly scope your questions using references. Here’s how you can do that:

- **File references:** You can specify a particular file in your question by adding a `#file:` before the file name. 

  :::image type="content" source="../media/chat-scope-file-referencing-pick.png" lightbox="../media/chat-scope-file-referencing-pick.png" alt-text="Screenshot of chat scope file referencing pick.":::

  For example, if you’re working with a file named `controller.js`, you can use the #file command to select it and reference it directly in your question as `#file:controller.js`. This feature tells Copilot Chat to focus on the contents of that file when generating a response.

  :::image type="content" source="../media/chat-scope-file-referencing.png" lightbox="../media/chat-scope-file-referencing.png" alt-text="Screenshot of chat scope file referencing.":::

- **Environment References:** You can reference the entire solution or workspace by using `@workspace`. This feature allows Copilot Chat to consider the broader context of the projects and configurations that are currently open in your Visual Studio IDE. For instance, asking "@workspace where is the calculate function?" prompts Copilot to consider the entire solution to find the most relevant information.

### Slash commands

Slash commands in GitHub Copilot Chat allow you to quickly specify the intent of your query. This can significantly improve the quality of the responses you receive by making your requests more focused. Here are some commonly used slash commands:

- **/doc:** Adds comments to the specified or selected code. For example, you can type `/doc` followed by the code you want to document, and Copilot generates appropriate comments.

  :::image type="content" source="../media/doc-slash-commands.png" lightbox="../media/doc-slash-commands.png" alt-text="Screenshot of /doc slash commands.":::

- **/explain:** Provides explanations for selected code. This command is useful when you need to understand what a particular piece of code does. For example, `/explain the #file:controller.js` gives you a detailed explanation of that file.

  :::image type="content" source="../media/explain-slash-commands.png" lightbox="../media/explain-slash-commands.png" alt-text="Screenshot of /explain slash commands.":::

- **/fix:** Proposes fixes for problems in the selected code. If you're facing issues, you can highlight the problematic section and use `/fix` to receive suggestions for resolving the issue.

  :::image type="content" source="../media/fix-slash-commands.png" lightbox="../media/fix-slash-commands.png" alt-text="Screenshot of /fix slash commands.":::

- **/generate:** Helps in generating new code based on your requirements. For example, `/generate code to find the root of a number in client.js` creates a function to perform the task.

  :::image type="content" source="../media/generate-slash-commands.png" lightbox="../media/generate-slash-commands.png" alt-text="Screenshot of /generate slash commands.":::

- **/optimize:** Analyzes and suggests improvements to the running time or efficiency of the selected code. For instance, `/optimize the `calculate` method in controller.js` focuses on enhancing the performance of that specific method.

  :::image type="content" source="../media/optimize-slash-commands.png" lightbox="../media/optimize-slash-commands.png" alt-text="Screenshot of /optimize slash commands.":::

- **/tests:** Automatically creates unit tests for the selected code. You can simply highlight the code and use `/tests using Mocha` to generate tests.

### Model selection and premium features

GitHub Copilot Chat offers different AI models to optimize your development workflow. Some environments provide model selection options that let you choose between different capability levels based on your specific needs:

**Standard models (GPT-4o):**
- Provide fast, reliable responses for most development tasks
- Consume 1 PRU per request
- Ideal for routine coding assistance, code explanations, and basic debugging
- Examples: Simple function generation, syntax help, basic refactoring suggestions

**Premium models (o1-preview, o1-mini):**
- Offer enhanced reasoning capabilities for complex problems
- Consume 2 PRUs per request (double the standard rate)
- Better suited for sophisticated analysis, complex algorithms, and architectural decisions
- Examples: Advanced debugging of multi-threaded code, complex algorithm design, security analysis

When working on challenging problems that require deep reasoning, premium models can provide more thorough analysis and comprehensive solutions. However, consider your PRU usage when selecting models for different types of tasks.

> [!NOTE]
> Using premium models (o1-preview, o1-mini) consumes 2 PRUs instead of 1 for the same request. Monitor your monthly allowances and choose the appropriate model based on task complexity. For current details on PRU consumption and limits, refer to the [Requests in GitHub Copilot documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/concepts/billing/copilot-requests).

### Copilot agents

GitHub Copilot agents are custom tools that you can build and integrate with GitHub Copilot Chat to provide additional functionalities tailored to your specific needs. In addition to slash commands, you can use specific agents within Copilot Chat in your IDE to handle different tasks:

- **@workspace:** This agent allows you to extend the context of whatever questions you ask Copilot to the whole project. It is useful for getting code generated that would fit in your project right away, using information from your whole project. It can also be utilized for getting answers about your whole codebase. 

  :::image type="content" source="../media/workspace-agent-command.png" lightbox="../media/workspace-agent-command.png" alt-text="Screenshot of `@workspace` agent command.":::

  You can also use the “@workspace /new” smart action, which allows you  to generate a completely new project from scratch based on your requirements. For example, “@workspace /new generate new html file pages and javascript for advanced calculations“

  :::image type="content" source="../media/workspace-new-agent-command.png" lightbox="../media/workspace-new-agent-command.png" alt-text="Screenshot of  `@workspace \new` agent command.":::

  Click on “Create Workspace” to proceed with code generation and just like that you have your new project with the code you requested.

  :::image type="content" source="../media/new-generated-workspace-project.png" lightbox="../media/new-generated-workspace-project.png" alt-text="Screenshot of new generated workspace project.":::

- **@terminal:** This agent is useful for command-line related questions. For example, you could ask it to find the largest file in a directory or explain the last command you ran.

  :::image type="content" source="../media/terminal-agent-command.png" lightbox="../media/terminal-agent-command.png" alt-text="Screenshot of `@terminal` agent command.":::

- **@vscode:** Use this agent to ask questions related to Visual Studio Code, such as how to debug or change settings within the IDE.

  :::image type="content" source="../media/vscode-agent-command.png" lightbox="../media/vscode-agent-command.png" alt-text="Screenshot of `@vscode` agent command.":::

  By effectively utilizing these tools and techniques, you can significantly improve the quality of responses you receive from GitHub Copilot Chat, making your coding experience more efficient and productive.

> [!NOTE]
> Advanced agents like @workspace and complex operations may consume more Premium Request Units (PRUs). Simple queries typically use 1 PRU, while complex workspace analysis or project generation can use 2-5 PRUs. For current details on PRU consumption, monthly allowances, and rate limits, refer to the [Requests in GitHub Copilot documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/concepts/billing/copilot-requests).
