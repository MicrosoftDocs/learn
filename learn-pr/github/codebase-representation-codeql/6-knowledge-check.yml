quiz:
  questions:
  - content: "What does CodeQL first do when creating a database?"
    choices:
    - content: "Analyzes both compiled languages and interpreted languages"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Compiled languages extraction works by monitoring the normal build process and interpreted languages. The extractor runs directly on the source code, so these two different approaches are not the first step for CodeQL when creating a database"
    - content: "Extracts a single relational representation of each source file"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. To create a database, CodeQL first extracts a single relational representation of each source file in the codebase."
    - content: "Converts results produced during query execution into a meaningful form"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The final step converts results produced during query execution into a form that is more meaningful in the context of the source code"
  - content: "What is the format of the command used to create and analyze CodeQL database from the CLI?"
    choices:
    - content: "`codeql [command] [subcommand]`"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The CodeQL CLI includes commands to create and analyze CodeQL databases from the command line using this command"
    - content: "`codeql [subcommand] [command]`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. [subcommand] does not come before [command] to create and analyze a CodeQL database from the CLI "
    - content: "`[command] [subcommand] codeql`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. 'codeql' needs to appear to start the command"
  - content: "What is an extractor?"
    choices:
    - content: "A hierarchical representation of the code"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The database contains a full, hierarchical representation of the code, including a representation of the abstract syntax tree, the data flow graph, and the control flow graph"
    - content: "A representation of the abstract syntax tree"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The database contains a full, hierarchical representation of the code, including a representation of the abstract syntax tree, the data flow graph, and the control flow graph"
    - content: "A tool that produces the relational data"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. An extractor is a tool that produces the relational data and source reference for each input file, from which a CodeQL database can be built"
  - content: "The CLI's built-in search operations does which of the following?"
    choices:
    - content: "Automatically looks in parent directories for the files used in the database creation and analysis"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The siblings are searched, not the parent directories"
    - content: "When manually prompted, looks in sibling directories for the files used in the database creation and analysis"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A manual prompt does not occur since this is automatic"
    - content: "Automatically looks in all of its sibling directories for the files used in the database creation and analysis"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The CLI’s built-in search operations automatically look in all of its sibling directories for the files used in database creation and analysis"
  - content: "By default, which severity level will cause a pull request check failure when using code scanning?"
    choices:
    - content: "`Error`"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. By default, only alerts with the severity level of Error or security severity level of Critical or High will cause a pull request check failure, and a check will still succeed with alerts of lower severities"
    - content: "`Warning`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. `Warning` is a setting, not a severity level"
    - content: "`Medium`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "incorrect. `Medium` is a setting, not a severity level"
  - content: "Which is one way to optimize CodeQL analysis runtimes?"
    choices:
    - content: "Analyze multiple languages"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Analyzing multiple languages may slow down CodeQL analysis runtimes"
    - content: "Increase the memory"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Increasing the memory will help to optimize CodeQL analysis runtimes"
    - content: "Increase the amount of code analyzed"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Increasing the amount of code analyzed may slow down CodeQL analysis runtimes"
