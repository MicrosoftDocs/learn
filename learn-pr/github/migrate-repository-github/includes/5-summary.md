In this module, you learned how to move your existing project to GitHub from a legacy version-control system.

You learned about:

- Preparing your project for a successful migration.
- Handling any binary files currently stored in your project.
- Creating important Git files like a `.gitignore`.
- Importing your project to GitHub.

Now that you have your project on GitHub, learn to [Manage an InnerSource program by using GitHub](/training/modules/manage-innersource-program-github/) and [Create an open-source program by using GitHub best practices](/training/modules/create-open-source-program-github/).
