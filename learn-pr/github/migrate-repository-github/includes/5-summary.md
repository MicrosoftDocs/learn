In this module, you learned how to move your existing project to GitHub from a legacy version control system.

You learned about:

- Preparing your project for a successful migration
- Handling any binary files currently stored in your project
- Creating important Git files like a `.gitignore`
- Importing your project to GitHub

Now that you have your project on GitHub, learn to [Manage an InnerSource program by using GitHub](/learn/modules/manage-innersource-program-github/) and [Create an open-source program by using GitHub best practices](/learn/modules/create-open-source-program-github/).
