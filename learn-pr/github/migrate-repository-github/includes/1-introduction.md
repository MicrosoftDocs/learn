GitHub is home to millions of software projects with more joining every day. There are so many great reasons to host your project on GitHub, but getting there from a legacy version control system may seem daunting.

Suppose you are managing the version control for a project and want to move to GitHub. You probably have a lot of questions, like "How do I get started?" and "How is GitHub different from what I use now?". These are valid concerns, and the good news is that virtually any project can be effectively hosted on GitHub.

In this module, you learn how to prepare and migrate a project to GitHub from a legacy version control system.

> [!NOTE]
> If you are uploading a project that is not yet hosted in a version control system, consider completing [Upload your project by using GitHub best practices](/learn/modules/upload-project-github) instead.
