GitHub Actions are quickly becoming a core feature to DevOps in many organizations. This enables developers to automate, customize, and execute their software development workflows right within their GitHub repository.

Suppose your organization is already using GitHub Actions and, as it's scaling up operations, decides to upgrade its GitHub instance to GitHub Enterprise Cloud or Enterprise Server. To take full advantage of all the features available in GitHub Enterprise, you've been asked by your CIO to evaluate how the development teams in your organization currently use GitHub Actions. You also need to establish a plan to optimize the use of actions and workflows currently in place. But first, you really need to understand what GitHub Actions options are available to you in your enterprise instance.

In this module, you'll discover which GitHub Actions features are available for your enterprise instance. You'll then be able to use them according to your specific use case. This module is organized in three parts that cover three key features of GitHub Actions: _actions and workflows_, _runners_, and _encrypted secrets_.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you'll:

- Identify the different tools you can use at enterprise and organization levels to manage your actions and workflows.
- Evaluate what the appropriate runners are for your enterprise instance.
- Discover the different configurations available for self-hosted runners and customize them according to your enterprise use case.
- Understand what encrypted secrets are and how to use them in your actions and workflows.

## Prerequisites

- A GitHub Enterprise Cloud or Enterprise Server account
- Working knowledge of GitHub Actions and workflows
