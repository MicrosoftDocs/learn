In this exercise, you use GitHub to validate your knowledge on using secrets in a GitHub Actions workflow.

This GitHub exercise is graded automatically once you've attempted a solution to the challenge. The results of your actions and helpful feedback are provided in real time within the `grade-learner` workflow logs.

Here are some helpful tips before you begin the exercise:

- Read the **About this exercise** section in the exercise's repository README to understand how the exercise works.
- Follow the steps provided in the **Instructions** section to successfully complete the exercise.
- To see the results of your exercise, navigate to the **Actions** tab of your cloned repository and select the most recent run on the **Grading** workflow.
- Stuck on what to do? Revisit the content in the previous unit or check out the **Useful resources** section in the exercise's repository README for some additional resources.

>[!NOTE]
> A grading script exists under `.github/workflows/grading.yml`. You do not need to modify this workflow to complete this exercise. **Altering the contents in this workflow can break the exercise's ability to validate your actions, provide feedback, or grade the results**.

This exercise is a challenge based on content covered in this module, and it may take several attempts to complete the exercise. If you get stuck, we recommend revisiting previous content in this module or navigating to some of the other resources provided to find the solution.
