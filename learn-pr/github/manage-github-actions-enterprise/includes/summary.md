Your goal in this module was to identify the tools and strategies you can use in your GitHub Enterprise instance to manage the use of GitHub Actions in your organization.

To accomplish this goal, you learned how to:

- Use different tools at enterprise and organization levels to manage your actions and workflows.
- Evaluate what the appropriate runners are for your enterprise instance.
- Customize your self-hosted runners according to your enterprise use case.
- Scope, create, and access encrypted secrets in your actions and workflows.

Next, you practiced how to create an encrypted secret in a repository and pass it in an action.
