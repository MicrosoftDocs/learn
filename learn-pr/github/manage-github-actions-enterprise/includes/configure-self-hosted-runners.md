In the previous unit, you explored how to choose and manage GitHub-hosted and self-hosted runners at a high level. In this unit, you'll learn how to configure, organize, monitor, and secure self-hosted runners for enterprise-scale use. This includes:

- Setting up runners with proxies and custom labels
- Managing runner groups
- Monitoring runner health and performance
- Configuring secure access using labels and IP allowlists

## Configure self-hosted runners for enterprise use  

Self-hosted runners in GitHub Actions provide greater flexibility and control for enterprises that require **customized environments, network access, and security hardening**. This guide covers best practices for configuring self-hosted runners, including **proxies, labels, and networking** considerations.  

### 1. Setting up a self-hosted runner 

#### Step 1: Create and register a self-hosted runner
1. Navigate to **GitHub Enterprise ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Actions ‚Üí Runners**.  
2. Click **New Runner** and select the desired OS (**Linux, Windows, or macOS**).  
3. Follow the provided commands to install and configure the runner on your machine.  

#### Step 2: Install & start the runner  
Run the following commands based on your OS:  

**Linux/macOS**
```sh
./config.sh --url https://github.com/<org-name> --token <generated-token>
./run.sh
```

**Windows (PowerShell)**
```
.\config.cmd --url https://github.com/<org-name> --token <generated-token>
.\run.cmd
```

### 2. Configuring proxies for self-hosted runners
Enterprises often operate behind corporate firewalls and proxies that restrict internet access. To allow self-hosted runners to communicate with GitHub, configure proxy settings as follows:

##### Linux/macOS: Configure proxy
Edit the environment file to define proxy settings:
```
export http_proxy=http://proxy.company.com:8080
export https_proxy=http://proxy.company.com:8080
export no_proxy=localhost,127.0.0.1
```
Apply the settings:

```
source ~/.bashrc
```
#### Windows: Configure proxy

Use the following PowerShell commands:

```
[System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("HTTP_PROXY", "http://proxy.company.com:8080", "Machine")
[System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("HTTPS_PROXY", "http://proxy.company.com:8080", "Machine")
```
### 3.Using Labels for runner management

Labels help organize and route jobs to specific self-hosted runners based on OS, hardware, or project requirements.

#### Assigning labels to a runner

When configuring a runner, you can assign custom labels:

```
./config.sh --url https://github.com/<org-name> --token <generated-token> --labels "high-memory,gpu"
```

#### Targeting a specific runner in a workflow
To run a job on a specific runner with labels, update the workflow .yml:
```
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: [self-hosted, high-memory]
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
```

### 4.Networking considerations
#### Allowlist GitHub IPs

GitHub-hosted runners operate on dynamic IPs, but self-hosted runners need firewall rules to allow access. Retrieve the latest GitHub IP ranges:
```
curl -s https://api.github.com/meta | jq .actions
```
Whitelist these IPs in your firewall settings to ensure connectivity.

#### Private network & VPN access
For enterprise workloads requiring access to private systems, configure the runner to connect via VPN or an internal network.

### 5. Security best practices for enterprise runners
Restrict runners to trusted workflows: Prevent untrusted code from executing on self-hosted runners.  
Use ephemeral runners: Automatically remove runners after jobs to prevent persistent threats.  
Monitor runner activity: Log all runner actions and audit access.  
Apply OS security patches: Regularly update and secure the runner machine.   

### Manage self-hosted runners using groups  
Runner groups allow organizations to **manage access, control workload distribution, and enforce security policies** for self-hosted runners in GitHub Actions. This guide covers how to **create, manage, and move runners between groups** effectively.

### 1. Understanding runner groups  
Runner groups help **organize and control** self-hosted runners within a **GitHub Enterprise or Organization**. They allow:  
- Restricting which repositories can use specific runners.  
- Controlling runner availability for different teams or workloads.  
- Managing permissions for **specific branches, workflows, or environments**.

#### Runner group availability  
| GitHub Plan | Runner Groups Available? |  
|-------------|--------------------------|  
| GitHub Free | ‚ùå Not Available |  
| GitHub Pro | ‚ùå Not Available |  
| GitHub Team | ‚úÖ Available |  
| GitHub Enterprise | ‚úÖ Available |  

### 2. Creating a runner group 

1. Go to **GitHub ‚Üí Organization Settings ‚Üí Actions ‚Üí Runners**.  
2. Click **"New group"** under **Self-Hosted Runners**.  
3. Provide a **name** for the group (e.g., "Linux-Runners", "High-Memory").  
4. Choose **who can access the group** (entire organization or specific repositories).  
5. Click **Save**.

### 3. Adding Runners to a Group 
Once the group is created, you can **add runners manually or during registration**.

##### Option 1: Assign during registration 
When configuring a new runner, specify the group:  
```sh
./config.sh --url https://github.com/<org-name> --token <generated-token> --runnergroup "Linux-Runners"
```
#### Option 2: Move an existing runner
1. Navigate to **GitHub ‚Üí Organization Settings ‚Üí Actions ‚Üí Runners.** 
2. Locate the **runner** and click **Edit.** 
3. Select a **new runner group** and save changes. 

### 4. Managing access and permissions
#### Restricting runner group access
**Organization-level runners:** Restrict usage to specific repositories. 
**Repository-level runners:** Only selected workflows can access the runner.

Example: Restrict access to a specific repository
1. Navigate to **Runner Group Settings.**
2. Under **Repository Access**, select **"Only select repositories".**
3. Add the repositories that are allowed to use the runner group.

### 5. Moving runners between groups
To **reassign a runner** from one group to another:

1. Go to **GitHub ‚Üí Organization Settings ‚Üí Actions ‚Üí Runners.**
2. Click on the **runner name.**
3. Select **Change group** ‚Üí **Choose a new group.**
4. Click **Save.**
Alternatively, unregister and re-register the runner in a different group:
```
./config.sh remove
./config.sh --url https://github.com/<org-name> --token <generated-token> --runnergroup "New-Group"
```

- Create separate groups for different OS types (e.g., Windows, Linux, macOS).  
- Use labels to further classify runners (e.g., GPU, high-memory, ARM).  
- Limit runner access to trusted repositories only.  
- Regularly audit and update runner groups based on team requirements.  
- Monitor runner usage and performance to optimize CI/CD workloads.

## Monitor, troubleshoot, and update self-hosted runners**  
Managing self-hosted runners effectively requires **continuous monitoring, proactive troubleshooting, and regular updates**. This guide covers best practices and GitHub-recommended methods for ensuring **high availability, security, and performance** of self-hosted runners.

### 1. Monitoring self-hosted runners 

#### Checking runner status
To monitor runner availability:  
1. Navigate to **GitHub ‚Üí Organization Settings ‚Üí Actions ‚Üí Runners**.  
2. Review the status:  
   - ‚úÖ **Idle** ‚Üí Ready for workflows.  
   - üîÑ **Active** ‚Üí Currently running a job.  
   - ‚ùå **Offline** ‚Üí Runner is down or disconnected.  

#### Using GitHub API to fetch runner status
You can programmatically check the status of self-hosted runners:  
```sh
curl -H "Authorization: token <your_github_token>" \
     -H "Accept: application/vnd.github.v3+json" \
     https://api.github.com/orgs/<org-name>/actions/runners
```
Response example:
```
{
  "total_count": 2,
  "runners": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "runner-1",
      "status": "online"
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "name": "runner-2",
      "status": "offline"
    }
  ]
}
```
### Logging and metrics

- **System Logs:** Check logs in the `_diag/` directory within the runner installation folder.
- **GitHub Actions Workflow Logs:** Navigate to Actions ‚Üí Workflow Run ‚Üí Logs to see runner execution details.
- **Monitoring via Prometheus/Grafana:** Configure Prometheus exporters to track CPU, memory, and job execution time.

### 2. Troubleshooting self-hosted runners

#### Common issues and fixes

| Issue                        | Possible Cause                        | Fix                                      |
|------------------------------|---------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Runner shows Offline         | Network issue, token expired, or runner crashed | Restart runner: `./run.sh`               |
| Job stuck in Queued state    | No available runners with required labels | Add runners or update labels             |
| Job fails with permission errors | Incorrect runner permissions           | Ensure runner has the correct access     |
| Workflow execution is slow   | High CPU/memory usage                 | Monitor system metrics & scale runners   |

#### Restarting a runner
If a runner is stuck or not responding, restart it:

```sh
./svc.sh stop
./svc.sh start
```
For systemd-based Linux runners:
```
sudo systemctl restart actions.runner.<org-name>.<runner-name>.service
```
#### Checking logs for errors
**Runner logs:** `<runner_dir>/_diag/Runner_<timestamp>.log`
**GitHub Actions logs:** Check workflow execution logs in the GitHub UI.

### 3. Updating self-hosted runners
#### Checking for Runner Updates
GitHub periodically updates runner binaries. To check for updates:

```sh
./config.sh --version
```

You can also check runner versions via API:
```
curl -H "Authorization: token <your_github_token>" \
     -H "Accept: application/vnd.github.v3+json" \
     https://api.github.com/repos/actions/runner/releases/latest
```
#### Updating the runner
**1. Manual update**
Stop the runner
```
./svc.sh stop
```
**2. Download the latest runner:**
```
curl -o actions-runner-linux-x64.tar.gz -L \
     https://github.com/actions/runner/releases/latest/download/actions-runner-linux-x64.tar.gz
```
**3.Extract and reconfigure:**
```
tar xzf ./actions-runner-linux-x64.tar.gz
./config.sh --url https://github.com/<org-name> --token <generated-token>
./svc.sh install
./svc.sh start
```
