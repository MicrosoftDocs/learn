  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
    - content: "What actions can you take at enterprise level to manage the use of GitHub Actions in your enterprise instance?"
      choices:
        - content: "Create workflow templates"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. Workflow templates are created at organizational level."
        - content: "Configure a GitHub Actions use policy"
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct. GitHub Actions use policies enable you to restrict access to GitHub Actions to specific organizations in your instance."
        - content: "Manually sync public actions in Enterprise Cloud"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. Public actions are automatically synced in Enterprise Cloud. Only with Enterprise Server do you have the possibility to manually sync public actions instead of automatically."

    - content: "What actions can you take to configure self-hosted runners for your enterprise use?"
      choices:
        - content: "Create and add custom labels to your runners"
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct. Custom labels can be used when you need to run jobs on runners that have specific capabilities."
        - content: "Add proxy configurations to your runners after they start."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. If you need a self-hosted runner to communicate with GitHub via a proxy server, you must add all proxy configurations to your runner before starting it."
        - content: "Add the IP address or IP address range of your runners at repository level."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. If your organization has configured an IP allowlist, you must add the IP address or IP address range of your self-hosted runners to the IP allowlist. IP allowlists are found in an organization's Settings."

    - content: "What are encrypted secrets?"
      choices:
        - content: "Encrypted secrets are authentication tokens you can generate in your account settings."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. The authentication tokens you can create in your account settings are personal access tokens (PATs)."
        - content: "Encrypted secrets are the equivalent of SSH keys in GitHub."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. SSH keys are also called SSH keys in GitHub."
        - content: "Encrypted secrets are encrypted environment variables you can create to store sensitive information."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct. Once created, encrypted secrets become available for use in your workflows and actions at the level at which they were created (organization, repository, or environment)."

    - content: "Which credential type poses the greatest security risk if used to access repositories from GitHub Actions?"
      choices:
        - content: "Repository deploy keys"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. Repository deploy keys are actually recommended as they grant access only to a single repository."
        - content: "Personal access token (classic)"
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct. Personal access tokens (classic) grant broad access to all repositories you have access to, creating unnecessary security risks."
        - content: "GitHub App tokens"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. GitHub App tokens provide granular permissions and are recommended for cross-repository access."
        - content: "GITHUB_TOKEN"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. GITHUB_TOKEN is not recommended as it's intentionally scoped to a single repository."

    - content: "Which feature in GitHub allows you to enforce that automated tests must pass before code can be merged to the main branch?"
      choices:
        - content: "Organization secrets"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. Organization secrets store sensitive information like API keys and credentials for use in GitHub Actions workflows. While important for security, they don't enforce automated test requirements before merging code."
        - content: "Repository rule sets"
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct. Repository rule sets allow you to enforce policies across branches, including requiring status checks (which represent automated tests) to pass before merging."
        - content: "Workflow templates"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. Workflow templates help standardize automation across an organization by providing predefined workflow structures, but they don't enforce that those workflows must pass before merging."
        - content: "Runner groups"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. Runner groups organize self-hosted runners but don’t enforce test requirements before merging code."

    - content: "Which of the following is a feature unique to GitHub Enterprise Cloud (GHEC)?"
      choices:
        - content: "Requires on-premises deployment and infrastructure management"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. This describes GitHub Enterprise Server (GHES), not GHEC."
        - content: "Provides centralized user management with identity provider integration"
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct. GHEC supports centralized user management and integrates with identity providers using SAML and SCIM."
        - content: "Must be installed and maintained by the organization's IT team"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. GHEC is maintained by GitHub and requires no installation or infrastructure management."
        - content: "Operates entirely within a private cloud environment"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. GHEC operates in GitHub’s public cloud infrastructure."

    - content: "What is a key benefit of using **reusable workflows** in GitHub Actions?"
      choices:
        - content: "Prevents any external contributors from running workflows"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. Security settings must be configured separately."
        - content: "Reduces redundancy and maintenance overhead"
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct. Reusable workflows help avoid repetitive configuration across multiple repositories."
        - content: "Can only be used in the same repository where they are defined"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. Reusable workflows can be referenced from other repositories."
        - content: "Automatically restricts all workflows to internal users"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. This must be explicitly configured."

    - content: "What is a primary benefit of using **GitHub-hosted runners** instead of self-hosted runners?"
      choices:
        - content: "Full control over hardware and software configuration"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. That’s a benefit of self-hosted runners."
        - content: "Ability to access internal/private networks"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. GitHub-hosted runners lack access to internal networks."
        - content: "Automatic updates for the OS and preinstalled packages"
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct. GitHub-hosted runners are maintained and updated by GitHub."
        - content: "Custom installation of non-standard software"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. That’s supported in self-hosted runners."

    - content: "What is the best practice when managing **encrypted secrets** in GitHub Actions?"
      choices:
        - content: "Print secrets in workflow logs to assist with debugging"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. Secrets should never be exposed in logs."
        - content: "Use the same secret across all repositories for consistency"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. It violates the principle of least privilege."
        - content: "Limit access by defining secrets at the lowest necessary level"
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct. This minimizes exposure and enhances security."
        - content: "Store secrets in the GitHub Actions log archive"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. Storing secrets in logs is unsafe and discouraged."
