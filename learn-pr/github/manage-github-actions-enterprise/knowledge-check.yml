          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. You must add all proxy configurations to your runner before starting it."
        - content: "Add the IP address or IP address range of your runners at repository level."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. This action is managed at the organization level in IP allowlists."

    - content: "What are encrypted secrets?"
      choices:
        - content: "Authentication tokens you can generate in your account settings."

          explanation: "Incorrect. This definition matches personal access tokens (PATs)."
        - content: "The equivalent of SSH keys in GitHub."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. SSH keys are separate and named accordingly."
        - content: "Encrypted environment variables for storing sensitive information."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct. You can securely scope them by repository, organization, or environment."

      choices:
        - content: "Repository deploy keys"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. These credentials are scoped and safer for single-repo use."
        - content: "Personal access token (classic)"
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct. These credentials have broad access, making them riskier."
        - content: "GitHub App tokens"

      choices:
        - content: "Organization secrets"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. They handle credentials, not enforcement of tests."
        - content: "Repository rule sets"
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct. Rule sets can enforce status checks before merges."
        - content: "Workflow templates"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. These aid reuse, not enforcement."
        - content: "Runner groups"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. They help manage runners, not enforce rules."

    - content: "Which of the following is unique to GitHub Enterprise Cloud (GHEC)?"
      choices:
