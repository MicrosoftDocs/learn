The goal of this module was to introduce the different GitHub Advanced Security features, show where they fit in your software development lifecycle, and describe how to make use of them.

Throughout the module, you learned which security features are available with a GitHub Advanced Security license. You also learned at which step these features can be integrated in your software development lifecycle. Then, you learned how to enable GitHub Advanced Security according to your enterprise plan, and how to set up access to the Advanced Security features across your organizations and repositories.

Finally, you learned how to make the most of GitHub Advanced Security by using the Security Overview and the Advanced Security endpoints. You're now ready to roll out GitHub Advanced Security in your organization!
