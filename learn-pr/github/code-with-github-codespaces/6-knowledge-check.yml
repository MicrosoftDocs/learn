      explanation: "Correct. After you create a Codespace, the clone is placed into the /workspace directory."
    - content: "/temp directory"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. /temp directory isn't the location where cloned content is placed."
    - content: "~/.bashrc directory"

  - content: "What's the maximum number of Codespaces that you can create per repository or branch?" 
    choices:
    - content: "You can only create two Codespaces."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Two isn't the maximum number of Codespaces you can create. However, there are limits to the number of Codespaces that you can create and run at the same time."
    - content: "You can create a total of ten Codespaces."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Ten isn't the maximum number of Codespaces you can create. However, there are limits to the number of Codespaces that you can create and run at the same time."
    - content: "You can create a total of thirty Codespaces."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Thirty isn't the maximum number of Codespaces you can create. However, there are limits to the number of Codespaces that you can create and run at the same time."
    - content: "You can create an unlimited number of Codespaces per repository or branch, depending upon available space. When you reach an upper amount of resources, a message displays that an existing Codespace needs to removed/deleted before a new Codespace can be created."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. You can have an unlimited number of Codespaces per repository or even per branch. However, there are limits to the number of Codespaces that you can create and run at the same time."
  - content: "What happens when Codespace loses internet connectivity?"
    choices:
    - content: "If the connection to the internet is lost while working in a Codespace, you aren't able to access your Codespace."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. A Codespace requires an internet connection. If the connection to the internet is lost while working in a Codespace, you aren't able to access your Codespace."
    - content: "Codespace doesn't require an internet connection. I can access my Codespace regardless if I lose connectivity."
      isCorrect: false

    - content: "If you lose internet connection while working on your Codespace, your changes aren't saved."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect.  Any uncommitted changes are saved. When reestablished, you can access Codespace in the same state as when the connection was lost."
  - content: "What defines the beginning of a Codespace's lifecycle?"
    choices:
    - content: "A Codespace's lifecycle begins when you create a Codespace and ends when you delete it."
      isCorrect: true

    - content: "A Codespace's lifecycle begins immediately when GitHub is opened and ends when the software is closed."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A Codespace's lifecycle begins when you create a Codespace and ends when you delete it."
    - content: "A Codespace's lifecycle begins when a repository is created and ends when it's deleted."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A Codespace's lifecycle begins when you create a Codespace and ends when you delete it."
