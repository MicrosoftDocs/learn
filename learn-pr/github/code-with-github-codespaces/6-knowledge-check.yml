    choices:
    - content: "You can only create two Codespaces."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Two isn't the maximum number of Codespaces you can create. However, there are limits to the number of Codespaces that you can create and run at the same time."
    - content: "You can create a total of 10 Codespaces."
