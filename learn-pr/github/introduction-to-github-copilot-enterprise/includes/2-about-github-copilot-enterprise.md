## GitHub Copilot Enterprise Features

Let's learn about the new features that come with GitHub Copilot Enterprise.

In this section we’ll be going over the following:

- Knowledge bases and custom models
- Chat customization to your codebase
- Pull request summaries
- Documentation search and summaries using docsets
- Code review

### Knowledge bases and custom models

Organization owners utilizing GitHub Copilot Enterprise can create customized knowledge bases, bringing together Markdown documentation across one or more repositories, pulling from code snippets, documentation, and other markdown files to help train GitHub Copilot Enterprise to the organization’s specific needs. This is unique to other GitHub offerings and is only offered for GitHub Copilot Enterprise customers. 

Having your organization’s own curated knowledge base boosts productivity, collaboration, and efficiency by allowing your developers to get tailored GitHub Copilot assistance while contributing and reviewing each other's work, making their work faster, and making it easier to stick to your organization standards.

With GitHub Copilot Enterprise, you can also fine-tune a private, custom model, which is built on a company’s specific knowledge base and private code. Organizations that utilize GitHub Copilot Enterprise’s custom models enable more accurate and contextually relevant suggestions and responses. This enhances their developers’ experience and productivity, allowing them to focus on more important tasks.

For more on creating a knowledge base, at the end of this module will be a link to the article “Managing Copilot knowledge bases.”

Next up, we’ll cover chats customized based on codebases.

### Chat customized to your codebase

GitHub Copilot Enterprise allows developers to use GitHub Copilot Chat to create prompts that are customized to your codebase. This feature opens up a world of new possibilities, enabling developers to apply it directly within issues, pull requests, code files within Codespaces, and even directly on repositories.

By initiating Copilot Chat threads within these environments, team members can harness Copilot's tailored suggestions to get the information they need from that space or enhance their coding experience while contributing.

Whether collaborating within a specific code space, pull request, issue, or repository; developers can seamlessly generate, discuss, and refine code suggestions specific to their project’s context. With the ability to comment on, edit, or accept these suggestions directly within the chat interface, teams can iteratively refine code in real time, fostering efficient collaboration and enhancing code quality across the development lifecycle.

Now let’s review pull request summaries.

### Pull request summaries

GitHub Copilot Enterprise allows developers to generate summaries of pull requests based on the code changes. This aims to reduce the time and efforts needed to create informative pull request descriptions, enhancing understanding and accelerating review processes allowing the reviewers to quickly grasp what the changes involve and areas requiring attention.

Now let’s discuss documentation search and summaries using docsets.

### Documentation search and summaries using docsets

:::image type="content" source="../media/2-search-org-documentation-on-github-copilot-chat.png" alt-text="Screenshot of searching through organization documentation using GitHub Copilot chat.":::

Docsets are private custom collections of internal code and documentation tailored to organizations' specific needs and workflows. GitHub Copilot Enterprise docset management can help you find the answers you're looking for and present them to you succinctly. For example, GitHub Copilot Enterprise docset management can answer specific questions about using a particular library or framework, so that you don't have to search the whole docset.

GitHub Copilot Enterprise docset management also references existing documentation related to your questions so that you can find more contextual information. This personalized approach streamlines development workflows, ensuring that solutions provided are precisely aligned with the intricacies of individual projects and workflows.
Next up, we’ll go over code review.

### Code review

Copilot code review takes collaboration to the next level by providing insightful assistance right within your codebase.

Just like in a code editor, Copilot can explain selected code snippets throughout your codebase, helping developers understand their teammates' intent and providing clarity on complex portions of code. This feature empowers developers to delve deeper into the codebase to gain valuable insights and foster a deeper understanding of the project's architecture and design principles.
