Living within and ingrained into the organization's codebase, Copilot uses your organization's codebase and internal knowledge to provide contextualized coding assistance, answer questions, explain the intent of the code in your repositories, and even suggest code to support your team's working patterns and best practices. This boosts productivity, collaboration, and efficiency by allowing your developers to get tailored GitHub Copilot assistance while contributing and reviewing each other's work,  making their work faster, and making it easier to stick to your organization standards.

## New features in GitHub Copilot Enterprise

Let's learn about the new features that come with GitHub Copilot Enterprise.

### Chat customized to your codebase

:::image type="content" source="../media/2-github-copilot-chat-window.png" alt-text="Screenshot of GitHub Copilot chat window.":::

GitHub Copilot Enterprise allows developers to use GitHub Copilot Chat to create prompts that are customized to your codebase. This feature opens up a world of new possibilities, enabling developers to apply it directly within issues, pull requests, code files within Codespaces, and even directly on repositories.

By initiating Copilot Chat threads within these environments, team members can harness Copilot's tailored suggestions to get the information they need from that space or enhance their coding experience while contributing.

Whether collaborating within a specific code space, pull request, issue, or repository, developers can seamlessly generate, discuss, and refine code suggestions specific to their project's context. With the ability to comment on, edit, or accept these suggestions directly within the chat interface, teams can iteratively refine code in real-time, fostering efficient collaboration and enhancing code quality across the development lifecycle.

### Pull request summaries

GitHub Copilot Enterprise allows developers to generate summaries of pull requests based on the code changes. This aims to reduce the time and efforts needed to create informative pull request descriptions, enhancing understanding and accelerating review processes allowing the reviewers to quickly grasp what the changes involve and areas requiring attention.

### Documentation search and summaries using docsets

Docsets are private custom collections of internal code and documentation tailored to organizations' specific needs and workflows. Copilot docset management can help you find the answers you're looking for and present them to you succinctly. For example, Copilot docset management can answer specific questions about using a particular library or framework, so that you don't have to search the whole docset.

Copilot docset management also references existing documentation related to your questions so that you can find more contextual information. This personalized approach streamlines development workflows, ensuring that solutions provided are precisely aligned with the intricacies of individual projects and workflows.

### Code review

Copilot code review takes collaboration to the next level by providing insightful assistance right within your codebase.

Just like in a code editor, Copilot can explain selected code snippets throughout your codebase, helping developers understand their teammates' intent and providing clarity on complex portions of code. This feature empowers developers to delve deeper into the codebase to gain valuable insights and foster a deeper understanding of the project's architecture and design principles.
