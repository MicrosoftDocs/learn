This exercise checks your knowledge on content covered in this module by using GitHub Actions and Microsoft Azure to create two deployment workflows.

## Getting started

When you select the _Start the exercise on GitHub_ button, you navigate to a public GitHub template repository that prompts you to complete a series of small challenges. Before you can begin the exercise, complete the following tasks:

- Select the _Start course_ button or the _Use this template_ feature within the template repository. This action prompts you to create a new repository. We recommend that you create a public repository. Private repositories use Actions minutes.

  After you make your own repository from the template, wait about 20 seconds and refresh.

- Follow the instructions in the repository's README to understand how the exercise works, its learning objectives, and how to successfully complete the exercise.

When you finish the exercise in GitHub, return here for:
