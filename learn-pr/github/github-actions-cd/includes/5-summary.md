In this module, you learned how to use GitHub Actions and workflows to implement a CD solution that deploys a container-based web app to Microsoft Azure Web Apps. You also automated the creation and teardown of the deployment environments by using a workflow.

You learned about:

- Options for triggering a CD workflow.
- Controlling workflow execution with job conditionals.
- Deploying to Microsoft Azure with a GitHub `deploy` action.
- Storing credentials with GitHub Secrets.
- Using GitHub actions to create and delete Azure resources.
