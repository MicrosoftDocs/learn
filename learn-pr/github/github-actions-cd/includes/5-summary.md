In this module, you learned how to use GitHub Actions and workflows to implement a CD solution that deploys a container-based web app to Microsoft Azure Web Apps. You also automated the creation and teardown of the deployment environments by using a workflow. 

You learned about:

- Options for triggering a CD workflow
- Controlling workflow execution with job conditionals
- Deploying to Microsoft Azure with a GitHub ```deploy``` action
- Storing credentials with GitHub Secrets
- Using GitHub actions to create and delete Azure resources
