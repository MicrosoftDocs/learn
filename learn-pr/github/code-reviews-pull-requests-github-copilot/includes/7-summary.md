Copilot is most effective when treated as a collaborator, not a replacement. Use it to accelerate routine checks and provide actionable suggestions, but rely on humans for architectural decisions and nuanced tradeoffs.

Best practices:

- Run Copilot reviews at the appropriate times in the development process in your IDE before pushing.
- Use `.github/copilot-instructions.md` to align Copilot's feedback with team standards.
- Treat Copilot's comments as accelerators, not mandates. Continue to use your release CI/CD pipelines, scans, and other best practices alongside Copilot reviews.
- Always validate and test fixes before merging.

With PRUs, you unlock premium-powered features that make Copilot an even stronger partner. By monitoring usage and aligning workflows, you ensure reviews stay fast, high-quality, and cost-effective.

Now that you've completed this module, you can:

- Explain how GitHub Copilot improves code reviews and PRs.
- Use Copilot as a reviewer on GitHub and in your IDE.
- Automate reviews with rulesets and custom instructions.
- Apply Copilot's suggestions and peer review fixes.
- Define PRUs, explain their benefits, and optimize their usage.
- Measure Copilot's impact on velocity, quality, and satisfaction.

With these practices, your team can transform code reviews from bottlenecks into collaborative, high-value moments-scaling expertise and delivering software faster.
