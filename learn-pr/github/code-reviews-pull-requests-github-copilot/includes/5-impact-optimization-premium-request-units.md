Premium Request Units (PRUs) are the fuel behind GitHub Copilot's most powerful review features. Every time you assign Copilot to review a large pull request, ask it to apply your repository's custom instructions to an entire codebase, or run a deep analysis of changes in your IDE, you're using PRUs. These premium resources give Copilot the additional processing power and context depth needed to provide richer reasoning, more reliable outputs, and suggestions that align with your team's standards.

## Learning objectives

By the end of this unit, you'll be able to:

- Define PRUs and explain how they enable Copilot's advanced review capabilities.
- Measure the impact of PRU-powered reviews on your workflow.
- Apply strategies to budget and optimize PRUs for maximum value.

## Understanding PRUs

Think of Premium Request Units (PRUs) as tokens that unlock Copilot's “extra gear.” Routine, lightweight tasks-like suggesting a small refactor to a single line-often don't consume PRUs. But premium-level tasks do. For example, asking Copilot to review a 1,500-line change across multiple files, apply your `.github/copilot-instructions.md` file, and check for security and style issues requires far more context and reasoning power.

With PRUs, Copilot can scan entire diffs, interpret your custom review guidelines, and return actionable fixes in seconds. Without them, it provides only its default, lightweight suggestions. PRUs make the difference between quick hints and full, context-rich analysis that's aligned with your team's standards-directly inside your pull requests or IDE.

**Example scenario:**

A developer pushes a massive refactor touching dozens of files. Copilot, assigned as a reviewer, uses PRUs to apply the repository's security and style guidelines to the entire change, flags several unsafe string interpolations, and even drafts Markdown comments explaining the issue. Instead of spending hours doing manual checks, human reviewers can now focus on the architectural impact of the refactor.


## Why PRUs matter for teams

PRUs are what make Copilot truly scalable in high-volume environments. With them, you can:

- **Get deeper analysis:** Spot subtle vulnerabilities, duplicated logic, or style violations across large diffs before they reach production.
- **Enforce consistency:** Apply the same security, readability, or style checks across every pull request automatically.
- **Handle bursts of activity:** During busy release cycles, rely on PRU-powered reviews to keep quality steady while human reviewers handle complex design decisions.
 
**Example scenario:**

Your team maintains a microservices architecture in Go, Python, and TypeScript. During a pre-release crunch, Copilot uses PRUs to review each service for language-specific best practices-flagging a risky `eval()` call in JavaScript and recommending a safer parser, while also catching a missing error check in a Go handler. This lets your team merge fixes quickly across all services without missing critical details.


## Measuring the impact of PRU-powered reviews

To understand the return on PRUs, track metrics such as:

- **PR lead time:** How quickly pull requests go from open to merged after adding Copilot reviews.
- **Quality indicators:** Reduction in post-merge security or style issues flagged by other tools.
- **Developer experience:** Feedback on whether Copilot makes reviews faster or clearer.

**Example metric:**

Before using PRUs, large PRs took an average of three days to merge and frequently triggered style fixes after release. After enabling PRU-powered reviews, the same PRs merged in one day with far fewer follow-up commits.

## Optimizing PRU usage

Managing PRUs ensures you're spending them where they add the most value:

- **Plan ahead:** Set alerts when you hit 75%, 90%, and 100% of your monthly PRU usage.
- **Use PRUs strategically:** Reserve premium reviews for large or high-risk changes; rely on standard Copilot suggestions for simple edits.
- **Refine your prompts:** Clean, specific requests reduce unnecessary retries and wasted PRUs.
- **Scale up if needed:** If your team consistently maxes out PRUs, consider a higher-tier Copilot plan to support the workload.

**Example scenario:**

A team notices that many PRUs are spent on trivial documentation changes. They update their workflow to use non-PRU requests for small edits and reserve PRU-powered reviews for code that affects production. As a result, their monthly PRU usage drops by 30% without losing quality.

PRUs are more than a technical detail-they're what make Copilot's advanced review capabilities possible. By understanding how PRUs work, measuring their impact, and optimizing their use, you can deliver deeper, context-rich reviews without wasting resources. This empowers teams to scale high-quality code reviews even under tight deadlines while still leaving final judgment and sign-off to human reviewers.
