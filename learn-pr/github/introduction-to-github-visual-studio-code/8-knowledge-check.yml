  questions:
    - content: "What's the best way to revoke GitHub access for a specific extension in Visual Studio Code?"
      choices:
        - content: "Revoke access for Visual Studio Code in your GitHub settings."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "This action revokes all access for Visual Studio Code, not just the access for a particular extension."
        - content: "Cancel the extension's selection from the **Manage Trusted Extensions** option on the user account menu."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "You can revoke access for a specific extension at any time by using the **Manage Trusted Extensions** option on the user account menu under your GitHub sign-in."
        - content: "Right-click the extension and select **Manage Trusted Extensions**."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "The **Manage Trusted Extensions** option is not found on the extension's shortcut menu."
        - content: "Modify the **Trusted Extensions** option in Visual Studio Code settings."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "There isn't a **Trusted Extensions** setting in Visual Studio Code."
    - content: "What's the best way to prevent files from being published to GitHub when you're publishing a new project that has not yet been initialized with Git?"
      choices:
        - content: "Add a .gitignore file to your project."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Although adding a .gitignore file works, it's an extra step that isn't required."
        - content: "Right-click files and select **Add to .gitignore**."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "There is no option on the shortcut menu for **Add to .gitignore**."
        - content: "Select **Add .gitignore** during the publishing process."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "There is no **Add .gitignore** option in the **Publish to GitHub** process."
        - content: "Clear the selection of items you don't want to publish when asked during the publishing process."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Clearing the selection of items to publish when prompted after you start the publishing process automatically creates a .gitignore file and adds the deselected files."
    - content: "How do you set the `origin` remote for a repository that you clone from Visual Studio Code?"
      choices:
        - content: "Visual Studio Code sets it automatically."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Visual Studio Code configures the `origin` remote for you automatically."
        - content: "Select **Add Origin** when prompted after you run the clone process."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "There isn't an option for **Add Origin** in the clone process."
        - content: "Run `git remote add origin` after the clone process finishes."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "You can add remotes after cloning, but it's not how the `origin` remote is set."
        - content: "Git sets it automatically."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Although Visual Studio Code uses Git, Git doesn't automatically make any configuration changes."
