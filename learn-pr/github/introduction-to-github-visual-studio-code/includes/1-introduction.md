Visual Studio Code is a lightweight and free coding editor used by many software developers around the world. GitHub is a version control platform that software developers use to host their projects. Visual Studio Code provides an integrated GitHub experience, making it easier for you to manage projects from inside your coding editor.

Imagine that you want to start contributing to project hosted on GitHub. First, you would have to get a copy of the repository locally. Then, you would spend time browsing the files of code and the history on GitHub to gain context of why a code change was made, who made it, and how long that code has been there for. To do that, you'd probably be switching between your editor and GitHub a lot. Instead, you can have focused experience directly from Visual Studio Code.

In this module, you'll use the GitHub integration inside Visual Studio Code to initialize a new repository on GitHub, clone existing repositories, and gain context of each file's history - all without leaving your editor.

By the end of this module, you will gain an introduction on leveraging GitHub and source control features inside of Visual Studio Code.
