Visual Studio Code is a lightweight and free coding editor that many software developers use around the world. GitHub is a version control platform for hosting development projects. Visual Studio Code provides an integrated GitHub experience, making it easier for you to manage projects from inside your code editor.

Imagine that you want to start contributing to a project hosted on GitHub. First, you'd have to get a copy of the repository locally. Then, you'd spend time browsing the files of code and the history on GitHub to gain context for why a code change was made, who made it, and how long that code has been there. To do that, you'd probably switch between your editor and GitHub a lot. 

Instead, you can have focused experience directly from Visual Studio Code. In this module, you'll use the GitHub integration inside Visual Studio Code to start a new repository on GitHub, clone existing repositories, and gain context for each file's history - all without leaving your editor.

By the end of this module, you'll know how to use GitHub and source control features inside Visual Studio Code.
