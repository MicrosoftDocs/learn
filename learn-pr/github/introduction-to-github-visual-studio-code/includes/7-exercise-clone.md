Let's see how you can use Visual Studio Code to start a new project by cloning the project from an existing repository on GitHub.

## Clone a new repository from GitHub

1. Open a new Visual Studio Code window. From the Explorer view, you can select **Clone Repository**. You should see an option to clone from GitHub.

2. Select the **Clone from GitHub** option from the drop-down list, and you'll find a list of your repositories. You can also search for other repositories on GitHub. Search for a repository by using the path **MicrosoftDocs/mslearn-python-products** and select the first option.

3. Choose a location on your computer where you want the repository to be cloned.
4. Select **Open** from the pop-up that appears after Visual Studio Code has cloned the repository.

## Compare changes in the commit history to gain context

1. Open the **README.md** file from the Explorer. After you have the file in the editor, expand the **Timeline** pane.

2. Select the commit made by the user _Burke Holland_. This step opens a read-only diff view so you can see all the changes associated with the commit. The green highlight shows that Burke has added those lines to the original content.
