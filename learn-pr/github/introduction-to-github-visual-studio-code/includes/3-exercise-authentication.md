In this exercise, you'll learn how to authenticate to GitHub by using Visual Studio Code. You'll also learn how to control your signed-in status, and which extensions in Visual Studio Code can use your authentication.

1. Make sure you have the latest version of Visual Studio Code installed. Select the Profile/accounts icon in the Activity Bar, then select **Check for Updates**, and then install the latest version, if necessary.

2. Select the extensions icon on the Activity Bar. Search for the **GitHub Pull Requests and Issues** extension, and install it.

4. Select **Continue**.

   Your Visual Studio Code window reopens, and you're signed in. You can double check by selecting the account icon again, and seeing your GitHub username.
