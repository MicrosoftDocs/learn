In this module, you learned how to build, host, and maintain a secure GitHub repository.

You learned about:

- Enabling vulnerable dependency detection for private repositories
- Detecting and fix outdated dependencies with security vulnerabilities
- Automating the detection of vulnerable dependencies with Dependabot
- Adding a security policy with a `SECURITY.md` file
- Removing a commit exposing sensitive data in a pull request
- Keeping sensitive files out of your repository by leveraging the use of a `.gitignore` file
- Removing historical commits exposing sensitive data deep in your repository

Now that you're familiar with security best practices, learn to [Automate DevOps processes by using GitHub Apps](/learn/modules/automate-devops-github-apps/).
