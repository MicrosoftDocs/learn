This GitHub exercise is graded automatically once you attempt a solution to the challenge. The results of your actions and your helpful feedback are provided in real time within the `grade-learner` workflow logs.

Here are some helpful tips before you begin the exercise:

- Read the **Welcome** section of the README file in the exercise's repository to understand more about the exercise.

> [!NOTE]
