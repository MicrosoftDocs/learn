In this exercise, you use GitHub to validate your knowledge about adding a `.gitignore` file to your GitHub repository.

This GitHub exercise is graded automatically once you attempt a solution to the challenge. The results of your actions and your helpful feedback are provided in real time within the `grade-learner` workflow logs.

Here are some helpful tips before you begin the exercise:

- Read the **About this exercise** section in the exercise's repository README to understand how the exercise works.
- Follow the steps provided in the **Instructions** section to successfully complete the exercise.
- To see the results of your exercise, navigate to the **Actions** tab of your cloned repository and select the most recent run on the **Grading** workflow.

>[!Note]
> A grading script exists under `.github/workflows/grading.yml`. You don't need to modify this workflow to complete this exercise. **Altering the contents in this workflow can break the exercise's ability to validate your actions, provide feedback, or grade the results.**
