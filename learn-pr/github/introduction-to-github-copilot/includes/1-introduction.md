GitHub Copilot is an AI-powered developer assistant that helps you work faster and with greater confidence throughout the software development lifecycle. Copilot uses the context of your code and comments to help generate code, explain existing logic, refactor implementations, fix bugs, and write tests—all directly from your development environment.

Research finds that when GitHub Copilot helps developers code faster, they can focus on solving bigger problems, stay in the flow longer, and feel more fulfilled with their work.

OpenAI created the generative pretrained language model in GitHub Copilot, powered by OpenAI Codex. An extension is available for Visual Studio Code (VS Code), Visual Studio, Neovim, and the JetBrains suite of integrated development environments (IDEs).
