GitHub is working to personalize GitHub Copilot for every team, project, and repository that uses it. The goal is to improve the software development life cycle, from writing code to submitting pull requests and beyond.

Together with [Microsoft's knowledge model](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2023/03/16/introducing-microsoft-365-copilot-your-copilot-for-work/), GitHub is using the data and insights within organizations to strengthen the connection between all workers and developers. These insights help ideas move from code to reality without friction. At the same time, GitHub continues to innovate and update the core of GitHub Copilot, the AI pair programmer that started it all.

GitHub Copilot helps developers work more efficiently and ship quality code.

At the end of this module, you can:

* Explain GitHub Copilot features and the subscription plans (Free, Pro, Pro+, Business and Enterprise)
