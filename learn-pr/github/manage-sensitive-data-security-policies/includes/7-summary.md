<!--Summary-->

The goal of this module was to help you understand how to protect your GitHub organization from security risks and what to do if there's a sensitive data exposure. 

You learned how to:

- Create documentation to outline security guidelines and provide useful information for collaborators.
- Set permissions and rules.
- Manage repository rulesets.
- Automate processes that prevent security risks.
- Respond to sensitive data exposure.
- Export audit log records and git events.

You reviewed GitHub's basic security tools, including the documents and settings available to secure your GitHub organization when working with collaborators.

This module explained how to create a new GitHub repository in a way that limits technical debt and risk. You also learned how to use built-in GitHub tools to manage user permissions and prevent unauthorized access.
