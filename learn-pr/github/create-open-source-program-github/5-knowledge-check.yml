  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
    - content: "Which project is the best candidate for an open-source program?"
      choices:
        - content: "The custom BizTalk 2004 adapter that connects your legacy warehouse database-management software with a proprietary in-house supply-chain system."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "This project would likely offer little value to the open-source community, because it's specifically tailored for your company's unique internal systems."
        - content: "Your company's flagship AI service that's highly regarded and produces most of your company's revenue."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "The intellectual property of this service is extremely valuable and almost surely should not be opened to the general public."
        - content: "A client library customers use to consume your company's services."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Because this software is designed for customer use, open-sourcing it could provide a great way to attract community participation."
    - content: "Suppose your organization has decided to open-source a project. What's a good reason for your team to decide **not** to go through with it?"
      choices:
        - content: "You don't want outsiders judging the code your team has written."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Opening a project to the world puts your work into the public eye. However, keep in mind that there are millions of open-source developers who all had to get used to others reviewing their work."
        - content: "Your team doesn't have the bandwidth to properly support essential tasks like addressing issues and reviewing pull requests."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "It would be a good idea to hold off until you can properly resource the effort."
        - content: "If the community starts offering substantial contributions to your project, then management might wonder why they have in-house developers to begin with."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Time has shown that this isn't the case. Companies always have a need for capable engineers, especially when they can scale up using the community."
    - content: "Which of the following files is **least** essential to an open-source project?"
      choices:
        - content: "`pull_request_template.md`"
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "While it can be helpful to offer a pull request template, it's not essential to the success of an open-source project."
        - content: "`README.md`"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "This file is the landing page for your project and the first thing potential contributors see when they visit the repository. It's essential because it explains the project and attracts support."
        - content: "`LICENSE`"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Not having a license can discourage participation because contributors might not be able to use your project to begin with. Having an explicit license makes it easier for them to clear usage and contribution."
    - content: "How can you check how your project compares to community standards?"
      choices:
        - content: "Sending polls through your project's mailing list."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "This might give you opinions about your community, but it doesn't check for the community's widely adopted best practices."
        - content: "Starting a discussion for your community in GitHub discussions."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "You should use GitHub discussions to establish open dialogues with your team and communities."
        - content: "Go to **Insights** > **Community** in your repository's main page."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "By checking your community insights, you can get a better idea on what you can improve to make your project more welcoming to your community."
