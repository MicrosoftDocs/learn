  questions:
  - content: "Which test set best represents a sound Phase 3 testing plan?"
    choices:
    - content: "Three small repositories only"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Testing only small repositories doesn't provide confidence for larger, more complex migrations."
    - content: "One large repository only"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Testing only one repository type doesn't validate the migration process across different scenarios."
    - content: "Small, medium, and large repositories with defined pass/fail criteria"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! A comprehensive testing strategy includes repositories of different sizes and complexities with clear success criteria for validation."
    - content: "Any two random repositories"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Random selection doesn't ensure representative testing across different repository types and use cases."
  - content: "After a test migration, which evidence increases confidence most for production readiness?"
    choices:
    - content: "The repository appears in GitHub Enterprise"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Simply appearing in GitHub doesn't validate data integrity or workflow functionality."
    - content: "The default branch name is 'main'"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Branch naming is a minor configuration detail that doesn't validate migration completeness."
    - content: "Documented validation showing commits, branches, tags, and workflow behavior"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! Comprehensive validation documentation proving data integrity and workflow functionality provides the highest confidence for production migration."
    - content: "Verbal confirmation from a developer"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Verbal confirmations are not sufficient evidence for production migration readiness."
  - content: "Which is NOT a recommended production migration order strategy?"
    choices:
    - content: "Low-risk repositories first"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Starting with low-risk repositories is a recommended strategy to minimize potential impact."
    - content: "Team-based batches"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Organizing migrations by teams is a valid strategy for coordination and support."
    - content: "Random selection"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! Random selection is NOT recommended as it doesn't consider risk, dependencies, or coordination needs."
    - content: "Size-based sequence"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Organizing by repository size is a valid strategy for managing migration complexity."
  - content: "What is the primary benefit of real-time monitoring during production migration?"
    choices:
    - content: "Replaces migration logs entirely"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Monitoring complements but doesn't replace detailed migration logs."
    - content: "Provides real-time visibility into progress and issues"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! Real-time monitoring enables immediate awareness of migration status and rapid response to issues."
    - content: "Creates automatic backups"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Monitoring tracks progress but doesn't create backups."
    - content: "Guarantees faster migrations"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Monitoring provides visibility but doesn't directly affect migration speed."
