GitHub Advanced Security (GHAS) plays a crucial role in enhancing the security posture of software development projects on GitHub. It provides a comprehensive set of tools and features designed to identify and address security vulnerabilities throughout the development lifecycle.

GHAS is primarily used by organizations running on GitHub Enterprise Cloud, offering enterprise-grade security features such as code scanning, secret scanning, and automated dependency management. Some of these capabilities help security and DevOps teams protect sensitive code, manage risk at scale, and meet compliance requirements across complex environments.

Note: These features are now available under separate SKUs—GitHub Secret Protection and GitHub Code Security—allowing teams to license only the components they need.

By integrating security directly into the development process with GHAS, your team can build more secure and reliable software.

In this module, we’ll be going over the basics of GHAS.
