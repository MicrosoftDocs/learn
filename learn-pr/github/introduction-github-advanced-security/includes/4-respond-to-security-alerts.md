Gone are the days when security is isolated and treated as a separate phase or gate in the software development lifecycle. As we learned, this approach may lead to delayed identification and remediation of vulnerabilities, as issues are only discovered late in the development process. It can result in increased time and resources spent on fixing security issues, potentially impacting project timelines.

In today’s day and age, it is imperative that we integrate security seamlessly into each step of the software development life cycle. This approach ensures that security considerations are addressed from the project's inception, resulting in faster identification and resolution of vulnerabilities.

- Early Detection: Integrating security early allows for the detection of vulnerabilities at the source code level, minimizing the likelihood of issues reaching production.
- Efficient Remediation: Security issues can be addressed promptly as part of regular development activities, reducing the time and effort required to understand the context of the issue.
- Consistent Security Standards: Integration ensures consistent adherence to security standards across the entire development life cycle, fostering a proactive security culture within the development team.
- Improved Collaboration: Collaboration between developers, security teams, and other stakeholders is enhanced, as security becomes a shared responsibility throughout the development process.

By understanding and implementing these advanced security practices with the help of GHAS, organizations can significantly enhance their software development processes and create a more resilient and secure development ecosystem.

GHAS empowers DevSecOps teams to prioritize innovation and enhance developer productivity without sacrificing security. Automated security checks are run with every pull request, surfacing issues in the context of the development workflow so vulnerabilities are fixed in minutes, not months. 

Our developer-first solution unlocks your ability to keep your code, supply chain, and secrets secure before you push to production. GHAS gives security teams visibility into the cross-organizational security posture and supply chain and unparalleled access to curated security intelligence from millions of developers and security researchers around the world.
