In this unit we'll review:

- Understanding the dependency graph
- Acting on GHAS alerts
- Who has access to alerts

Let’s take a closer look at how Dependabot works, starting with the dependency graph.

The dependency graph is central to supply chain security. The dependency graph identifies all upstream dependencies and public downstream dependents of a repository or package. You can see your repository’s dependencies and some of their properties, like vulnerability information, on the dependency graph for the repository.

To generate the dependency graph, GitHub looks at a repository’s explicit dependencies declared in the manifest and lockfiles. When enabled, the dependency graph automatically parses all known package manifest files in the repository and uses this scan to construct a graph with known dependency names and versions.

Key points about the dependency graph include:

- Includes information on your direct dependencies and transitive dependencies.
- Dependency graph is automatically updated when you push a commit to GitHub that changes or adds a supported manifest or lock file to the default branch. It's also automatically updated when anyone pushes a change to the repository of one of your dependencies as well.
- You can see the dependency graph by opening the repository's main page on GitHub and navigating to the Insights tab.
- If you have at least read access to the repository, you can export the dependency graph for the repository as an SPDX-compatible, Software Bill of Materials (SBOM), via the GitHub UI or GitHub REST API. For more information, see "Exporting a software bill of materials for your repository."

Additionally, you can use the Dependency submission API (beta) to submit dependencies from the package manager or ecosystem of your choice, even if the ecosystem isn't supported by dependency graph for manifest or lock file analysis. Dependencies submitted to a project using the Dependency submission API (beta) shows which detector was used for their submission and when they were submitted.

Other supply chain features on GitHub rely on the information provided by the dependency graph, which include the following:

- **Dependency review**: uses the dependency graph to identify dependency changes and help you understand the security impact of these changes when you review pull requests.
- **Dependabot alerts**: Dependabot cross-references dependency data provided by the dependency graph with the list of advisories published in the GitHub Advisory Database. The dependency graph scans your dependencies and generates Dependabot alerts when a potential vulnerability is detected.
- **Dependabot security updates**: Uses the dependency graph and Dependabot alerts to help you update dependencies with known vulnerabilities in your repository.

Although **Dependabot version updates** don't use the dependency graph, it's still worth mentioning. Dependabot version updates rely on the semantic versioning of dependencies instead. Dependabot version updates help you keep your dependencies updated, even when they don’t have any vulnerabilities. 

### Acting on GHAS alerts

With its comprehensive set of tools GHAS provides holistic visibility into an organization's security posture and the ability to enforce security adoption, enabling precise and effective prioritization and management of security risks.

One of the many tools that ensure security throughout the development process is all of the alerts that GHAS provides your organization. 

Let’s review them:

Code Scanning Alerts:

- CodeQL Analysis Alerts: Generated by CodeQL, GitHub's semantic code analysis engine, these alerts identify potential security vulnerabilities in the codebase. They cover a wide range of issues, including but not limited to SQL injection, cross-site scripting, and other code vulnerabilities.

Secret Scanning Alerts:

- Exposed Secrets Alerts: These alerts are triggered when potentially sensitive information, such as API keys or credentials, is identified within the repository's source code. Secret scanning helps prevent accidental exposure of confidential data.

Dependency Alerts:

- Dependabot Alerts: Dependabot automatically detects outdated dependencies in a project and creates pull requests to update them to the latest, secure versions. Dependabot alerts notify developers about available updates for project dependencies.


Security Overview Alerts:

- The Security Overview provides a comprehensive dashboard summarizing the security status of the repository.

Third Party Alerts: 

- You can integrate third-party code analysis tools with GitHub code scanning by uploading data as SARIF files. Learn more about this topic at the end of the module with a link to 'Integrating with code scanning.'

#### Implications of Ignoring an Alert

Ignoring a security alert poses significant risks to the project. Vulnerabilities may be exploited by malicious actors, leading to data breaches, service disruptions, or other security incidents. Ignoring alerts can also result in increased remediation efforts, potentially impacting project timelines and the overall trustworthiness of the software.

The long-term consequences of ignoring alerts may include reputational damage, regulatory noncompliance, and financial losses. It's crucial for development teams to prioritize and address security alerts promptly to mitigate these risks and maintain the integrity of the software.

When developers discover a security alert, their immediate role is to investigate the nature and severity of the alert. This involves understanding the impact on the codebase, potential exploit scenarios, and any necessary steps for remediation.

With the help of GHAS, developers can find and fix vulnerabilities earlier in the software development life cycle.


### Who has access to alerts?

GHAS provides granular access controls, allowing organizations to define who can view alerts for different security features. This ensures that only authorized personnel, such as security teams and relevant stakeholders, have access to sensitive security information.

Access management is role-based, with different roles having varying levels of access to GHAS alerts. Let’s take a moment to dig a bit deeper into roles and access to alerts:
- Code scanning & Dependabot alerts can be seen and modified by anyone with the `Write` repository role
- Secret scanning alerts can be seen and modified by anyone with the `Admin` repository role
- Any person or team can be granted access to see and modify all alerts on a repository, regardless of their repository role, by modifying the repo's "Access to alerts" settings

Now that we’ve reviewed which alerts can be seen by specific roles, it's worth noting that effective access management enhances collaboration by providing the right level of visibility to each team member. This ensures that stakeholders can focus on the security aspects relevant to their roles, facilitating a streamlined and efficient response to security alerts.

By understanding the intricacies of identifying vulnerabilities, responding to alerts, acknowledging the implications of inaction, and defining roles and access controls, development teams can leverage GitHub Advanced Security to its fullest potential, creating a more resilient and secure development environment.

In the next section, we’ll review how collectively GHAS can enhance your security ecosystem.
