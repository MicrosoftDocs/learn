  title: Check your knowledge 
  questions:
  - content: What is GitHub Advanced Security (GHAS)?
    choices:
    - content: "An automated tool for managing project dependencies."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This describes the purpose of Dependabot, not GHAS."
    - content: "An application security solution that empowers developers."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. GHAS is a security solution that empowers developers by embedding security features into their workflow to help prevent vulnerabilities and credential leaks in source code."
    - content: "A tool for analyzing source code for security vulnerabilities."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This describes the purpose of code scanning, which is a part of GHAS, but not the full definition of GHAS itself."
    - content: "A platform for tracking the full impact of changes to dependencies in a project."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This describes the purpose of Dependency Review, a feature of Dependabot within GHAS, but not the full definition of GHAS."
  - content: "How does code scanning contribute to the security of a software development project?"
    choices:
    - content: "By preventing unauthorized access to sensitive information."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This is more related to secret scanning, not code scanning."
    - content: "By automating the management of project dependencies."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This describes the purpose of Dependabot, not code scanning."
    - content: "By identifying and addressing security vulnerabilities in the codebase."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Code scanning analyzes source code for security vulnerabilities and coding errors, helping developers address these issues early in the development process."
    - content: "By analyzing source code for potential coding errors."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This is a general description of static analysis, which is a technique used in code scanning, but it does not fully describe the contribution of code scanning to security."
  - content: "How does Dependabot use the dependency graph in GitHub Advanced Security (GHAS)?"
    choices:
    - content: "To identify and address security vulnerabilities in the codebase."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This describes the purpose of code scanning, not how Dependabot uses the dependency graph."
    - content: "To automatically update project dependencies to their latest, secure versions."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While Dependabot updates project dependencies, this answer does not specifically mention how it uses the dependency graph."
    - content: "To generate alerts for potential security vulnerabilities in project dependencies."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This describes the purpose of Dependabot alerts, not how Dependabot uses the dependency graph."
    - content: "To cross-reference dependency data with the GitHub Advisory Database."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Dependabot uses the dependency graph to cross-reference dependency data with the GitHub Advisory Database and generate alerts for potential vulnerabilities in project dependencies."
  - content: "How does GitHub Advanced Security (GHAS) help integrate security into each step of the software development life cycle?"
    choices:
    - content: "By providing a comprehensive dashboard summarizing the security status of the repository."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This describes the purpose of the Security Overview, not how GHAS integrates security into each step of the software development life cycle."
    - content: "By automating security checks with every pull request, surfacing issues in the context of the development workflow."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. GHAS automates security checks with every pull request, surfacing issues in the context of the development workflow, which helps integrate security into each step of the software development life cycle."
    - content: "By generating alerts for outdated dependencies in a project."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This describes the purpose of Dependabot alerts, not how GHAS integrates security into each step of the software development life cycle."
    - content: "By providing access to curated security intelligence from millions of developers and security researchers around the world."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While GHAS provides access to curated security intelligence, this answer does not specifically mention how it integrates security into each step of the software development life cycle."
