In this exercise, we create a new repository using the GitHub template for a web API that uses the Python programming language.

## Environment setup

First you need to launch the Codespaces environment, which comes preconfigured with the GitHub Copilot extension.

1. Open the [Codespace with the preconfigured environment](https://codespaces.new/MicrosoftDocs/mslearn-advanced-copilot?azure-portal=true) in your browser.
1. On the **Create codespace** page, review the Codespace configuration settings, and then select **Create new codespace**.
1. Wait for the Codespace to start. This startup process can take a few minutes.
1. The remaining exercises in this project take place in the context of this development container.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> All GitHub accounts can use Codespaces for up to 60 hours free each month with two core instances. For more information, see [GitHub Codespaces monthly included storage and core hours](https://docs.github.com/billing/managing-billing-for-github-codespaces/about-billing-for-github-codespaces#monthly-included-storage-and-core-hours-for-personal-accounts).

> [!TIP]
> GitHub Copilot offers a free tier with **2,000 code autocompletes and 50 chat messages per month**. To get started, open Visual Studio Code, click on the GitHub Copilot icon, and then click "Sign in to Use GitHub Copilot for Free". [Learn more](https://gh.io/copilot). Educators, Students and, select open-source maintainers can receive Copilot Pro for free, learn how at: [https://aka.ms/Copilot4Students](https://aka.ms/Copilot4Students).

### Python Web API

When complete, Codespaces loads with a terminal section at the bottom. Codespaces installs all the required extensions in your container. Once the package installs are complete, Codespaces executes the `uvicorn` command to start your web application running within your Codespace.

When the web application starts successfully, a message in the terminal **Ports** tab shows that the server is running on port 8000 within your Codespace.

## Sign up for GitHub Copilot

If you haven't already, you need to register by setting up [a free trial or subscription for your account](https://github.com/github-copilot/signup).

>[!Note]
> Educators, Students and select open-source maintainers can sign up for Copilot for free, learn how at [Setting up GitHub Student and GitHub Copilot as an Authenticated Student Developer](https://aka.ms/Copilot4Students).
