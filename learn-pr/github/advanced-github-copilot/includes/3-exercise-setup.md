In this exercise, we create a new repository using the GitHub template for a web API that uses the Python programming language.

## Environment setup

First you need to launch the Codespaces environment, which comes preconfigured with the GitHub Copilot extension.

1. Open the [Codespace with the preconfigured environment](https://codespaces.new/MicrosoftDocs/mslearn-advanced-copilot?azure-portal=true) in your browser.
1. On the **Create codespace** page, review the Codespace configuration settings, and then select **Create new codespace**.
1. Wait for the Codespace to start. This startup process can take a few minutes.
1. The remaining exercises in this project take place in the context of this development container.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> All GitHub accounts can use Codespaces for up to 60 hours free each month with two core instances. For more information, see [GitHub Codespaces monthly included storage and core hours](https://docs.github.com/billing/managing-billing-for-github-codespaces/about-billing-for-github-codespaces#monthly-included-storage-and-core-hours-for-personal-accounts).

> [!TIP]
> GitHub Copilot offers a free tier with **2,000 code autocompletes and 50 chat messages per month**. To get started, open Visual Studio Code, click on the GitHub Copilot icon, and then click "Sign in to Use GitHub Copilot for Free". Log in to your GitHub account in the window that opens in the browser. [Learn more](https://gh.io/copilot). Educators, Students and, select open-source maintainers can receive Copilot Pro for free, learn how at: [https://aka.ms/Copilot4Students](https://aka.ms/Copilot4Students).

### Python Web API

When complete, Codespaces loads with a terminal section at the bottom. Codespaces installs all the required extensions in your container. Once the package installs are complete, Codespaces executes the `uvicorn` command to start your web application running within your Codespace.

When the web application starts successfully, a message in the terminal **Ports** tab shows that the server is running on port 8000 within your Codespace.

## Sign up for GitHub Copilot

If you haven't already, you need to register by setting up [a free trial or subscription for your account](https://github.com/github-copilot/signup).

>[!Note]
> Educators, Students and select open-source maintainers can sign up for Copilot for free, learn how at [Setting up GitHub Student and GitHub Copilot as an Authenticated Student Developer](https://aka.ms/Copilot4Students).
