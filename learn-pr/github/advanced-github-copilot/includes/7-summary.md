GitHub Copilot is a tool that offers many ways to interact with your project, and it helps you become a more efficient developer. Adding tests, fixing bugs, or generating automation allows you to improve the development lifecycle for your projects.

Now that you have finished this module, you should be able to:

- Use GitHub Copilot features like chat, agents, inline chat, and slash commands, which offer more flexibility to accomplish coding tasks.
- Apply the `@workspace` agent using GitHub Copilot Chat to provide more content when trying to get output relevant to your project.

## Delete your Codespaces resources

To avoid consuming all your monthly GitHub Codespaces time, it's important to delete all your resources after you upload your changes to your repository. Follow these steps to remove your resources:

1. Go to [Codespaces on GitHub here](https://github.com/codespaces).
1. Find your Codespace instance from the list, and select the three dots menu to display your options.
1. Select **Delete** to remove your Codespace instance.

>[!Note]
> If you don't commit your changes to your repository, you'll lose all your work. Therefore, it's important to commit and push your changes before deleting your Codespace instance.
