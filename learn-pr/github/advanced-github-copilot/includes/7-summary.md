- Apply the `@workspace` agent using GitHub Copilot Chat to provide more content when trying to get output relevant to your project.


## Delete your Codespaces resources

To avoid consuming all your monthly GitHub Codespaces time, it's important to delete all your resources after you upload your changes to your repository. Follow these steps to remove your resources:

1. Go to this link https://github.com/codespaces
1. Find your Codespace instance from the list and select on the three dots menu to display your options.
1. Select "Delete" to remove your Codespace instance.

>[!Note]
> If you don't commit your changes to your repository, you will lose all your work. Therefore, it's important to commit and push your changes before deleting your Codespace instance.
