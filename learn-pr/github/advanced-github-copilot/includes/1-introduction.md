GitHub Copilot is an AI coding partner that provides autocomplete suggestions while you code. Get suggestions by typing code or interactively using natural language.

Copilot analyses your file and related files, offering suggestions in your text editor. It uses context from written code and comments, and then suggests new lines or entire functions.

GitHub Codespaces is a hosted developer environment operating in the cloud that can be run with Visual Studio Code. You can customize the development experience for any development project on GitHub, preinstalling dependencies, libraries, and even Visual Studio Code extensions and settings.

## Scenario: Working with an existing project

As a developer, you want to be more productive typing code faster both for net new projects and existing ones. For this task, you want to use advanced features from an AI assistant that helps improve your developer workflows in code writing, documentation, testing, and more.

In this module, you understand how you can use advanced features of GitHub Copilot with applied examples modifying a repository using different techniques to add new HTTP API (Application Programming Interface) endpoints, write unit tests, and document existing code.

## What will I learn?

By the conclusion of this module, you acquire the skills to:

- Work with a preconfigured GitHub repository in Codespaces with the GitHub Copilot extension.
- Use interactive features of GitHub Copilot to generate useful suggestions for an existing project.
- Apply advanced GitHub Copilot features to learn more about a new project, write documentation, and create unit tests.

## What is the main objective?

After successfully finishing this module, you'll be capable of using interactive prompts and other advanced GitHub Copilot features to enhance a software project.
