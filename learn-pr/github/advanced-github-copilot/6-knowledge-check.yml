  questions:
  - content: "What is ghost text in GitHub Copilot?"
    choices:
    - content: "Ghost text in GitHub Copilot are suggestions that appear in your text editor as you type."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct! Ghost text refers to the suggestions given by GitHub Copilot without a prompt, based on your currently opened files. By accepting these suggestions with the Tab key or manually editing them, you can quickly write code and documentation for your project."
    - content: "Ghost text in GitHub Copilot are options used when typing to provide suggestions."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Ghost text does not involve any kind of options while typing."
    - content: "Ghost text in GitHub Copilot involves using prompts and natural language questions within your code or documentation."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "While you can provide a prompt for GitHub Copilot, ghost text does not require a specific prompt. Ghost text suggestions are based on context from the open files by default."
  - content: "How do you access GitHub Copilot's inline chat?"
    choices:
    - content: "Access the inline chat by clicking on the chat icon in the left sidebar of Visual Studio Code."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect, although you can use this method to access GitHub Copilot's dedicated chat pane. The inline chat requires a keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+i for Windows or Command+i for mac) to open in your code context."
    - content: "Use Ctrl+i on Windows or Command+i on a mac to open the inline chat."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct! By using the keyboard combination, you can access GitHub Copilot's inline chat without leaving your code context. This allows for efficient interaction with the tool and faster response times during development."  
    - content: "Access the inline chat by using Alt+i on Windows or Option+i on a mac."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect, these are not the correct keyboard shortcuts. You can access GitHub Copilot's inline chat using Ctrl+i for Windows and Command+i for mac instead."
  - content: "What are slash commands used for in GitHub Copilot?"
    choices:
      - content: "Slash commands are used to format your codebase according to best practices."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect, GitHub Copilot's slash commands don't enforce specific formatting rules. Instead, they help you quickly solve common development tasks like writing tests or documentation with predefined intents in the chat or inline pane."
      - content: "Slash commands are used to debug code and detect security vulnerabilities within your projects."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect. Although GitHub Copilot may provide suggestions for fixing bugs, slash commands aren't specifically designed for debugging or finding security vulnerabilities in your projects."
      - content: "Slash commands are shortcuts to quickly solve common development tasks within the chat or inline pane."
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "That's correct! Slash commands help you perform specific actions like writing tests and documentation faster by using predefined intents. You can access these slash command options in a drop-down menu after typing / in the chat or inline pane."       
  - content: "What are the benefits of using agents like '@terminal' or '@workspace' when interacting with GitHub Copilot?"
    choices:
    - content: "Agents in Visual Studio Code help you ask questions within a specific context, allowing for more precise and relevant answers from GitHub Copilot."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct! Agents like '@terminal' or '@workspace' allow you to interact with GitHub Copilot in the context of your terminal or entire workspace. By using these agents, questions are more precise and relevant, helping you efficiently solve development tasks."
    - content: "Agents help enforce a consistent code format based on best practices within Visual Studio Code for improved readability."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect, agents don't specifically enforce formatting rules. They are used to interact with GitHub Copilot in the context of your terminal or workspace when asking questions and receiving answers."
    - content: "Agents provide extra security features for detecting vulnerabilities and intrusions within Visual Studio Code projects."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect, agents don't specifically focus on providing security features. They are used to interact with GitHub Copilot in a specific context when asking questions related to development tasks."
  - content: "What are the benefits of using implicit prompts with slash commands in inline chat for fixing code issues with GitHub Copilot?"
    choices:
    - content: "Implicit prompts help enforce a consistent naming convention and syntax based on best practices within Visual Studio Code projects for improved readability."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Implicit prompts don't specifically focus on enforcing naming conventions or syntax rules. They are used to interact with GitHub Copilot in a way that can provide helpful responses without writing long, explicit prompts when fixing code issues."
    - content: "Implicit prompts help get better responses from GitHub Copilot without writing longer prompts, making it easier to interact and fix code issues."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct! Implicit prompts with slash commands in inline chat allow you for more straightforward interaction when fixing code. By using features like '/fix', GitHub Copilot can provide helpful responses even without detailed prompting, streamlining the development process."      
    - content: "Implicit prompts help detect security vulnerabilities and potential malicious activities within Visual Studio Code projects for increased safety."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Implicit prompts don't specifically focus on providing security features or detecting vulnerabilities in your projects. They are used to streamline interaction with GitHub Copilot when fixing code issues by using implicitly crafted prompts and slash commands."
