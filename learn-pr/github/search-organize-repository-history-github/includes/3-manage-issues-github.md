## Manage issues on GitHub

Once you've found relevant issues and pull requests, the next step is managing them effectively. This includes creating branches to address issues, assigning ownership, pinning important items, and handling general issue workflows.

Imagine you're actively working in a team repository. Issues are being opened daily, and the team needs clear ownership and status visibility to stay productive.

### Create a branch for an issue

Creating a branch directly from an issue helps keep your work organized and connected.

1. Open the issue you'd like to work on.
2. Click **"Create branch"** from the right sidebar (if available), or create a branch locally and push it.
3. Give the branch a descriptive name (e.g., `fix/sidebar-bug`), and start your work.

> **Tip**
> Linking a branch to an issue helps GitHub associate future pull requests with the issue.

### Assign issues to a team member

Assigning an issue makes it clear who is responsible for resolving it.

1. Open the issue.
2. In the right sidebar, click **Assignees**.
3. Select one or more collaborators.

Only users with write access can assign others. Users without write access can assign issues to themselves.

### Pin an issue for visibility

Pinning ensures critical issues stay at the top of the list.

1. Go to the **Issues** tab.
2. Find the issue and click the **three-dot menu** (â‹¯).
3. Select **Pin issue**.

You can pin up to three issues per repository.

To unpin: use the same menu and click **Unpin issue**.

### Basic issue management tips

* Use **labels** (e.g., `bug`, `help wanted`, `good first issue`) to organize issues.
* Add **milestones** to group issues by release or sprint.
* Use **projects** to track progress across multiple issues.
* Close issues manually or automatically with PR keywords (e.g., `Fixes #12`).

Effective issue management helps your team stay aligned, reduce duplicate effort, and speed up development.
