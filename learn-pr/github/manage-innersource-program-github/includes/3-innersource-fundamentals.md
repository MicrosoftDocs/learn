An integral part of adopting InnerSource within your team is establishing goals, milestones, and then creating a checklist of items that need to be accomplished within your team to meet those goals.

The following guide provides you with a getting started and expanded checklist of items to include in your GitHub repositories for the following categories:

- Team
- Repository
- Project
- Developers

Using the provided checklists, pick one of the above categories and compare the list of items to one of your existing repositories. If focusing on the repository itself, what files do you need to add or remove to add clarity around its purpose and how to contribute to or open up issues.

When you've read through the guide and have identified ways to improve your own GitHub repositories, return here for:
