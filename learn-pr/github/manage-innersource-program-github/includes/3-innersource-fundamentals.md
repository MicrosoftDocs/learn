An integral part of adopting InnerSource within your team is establishing goals, milestones, and then creating a checklist of items that need to be accomplished within your team to meet those goals.

The following guide provides you with a getting started and expanded checklist of items to include in your GitHub repositories for the following categories:

- Team
- Repository
- Project
- Developers

Using the provided checklists, choose one category and compare it to one of your current repositories. For example, if you're focusing on the repository itself, which files should be added or removed to clarify its purpose and contribution process?**

**Example checklist â€“ Repository:**
- [ ] Add or update `README.md`
- [ ] Include `LICENSE`
- [ ] Provide a clear contribution guide (`CONTRIBUTING.md`)
- [ ] Set repository visibility (public/internal/private)
- [ ] Include issue and pull request templates

After reading through the guide and identifying ways to improve your own GitHub repositories, return here for:
