  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "Which of the following Markdown snippets would produce the text *Hello, **world**!* in bold italics?"
    choices:
    - content: "`*Hello, *world*!*`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This snippet would produce *Hello, *world*!*."
    - content: "`**Hello, *world*!**`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This snippet would produce **Hello, *world*!**."
    - content: "`***Hello, world!***`"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Remember that you can also use underscores (`_`) instead of asterisks if you prefer."
    - content: "`### Hello, world!`"
      isCorrect: False
      explanation: "Incorrect. This snippet would produce ### Hello, world!"
  - content: "How do you print certain characters, like asterisks (`*`) and underscores (`_`), literally on your output?"
    choices:
    - content: "Use three in a row, like `***` or `___`."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This won't get you the results you're looking for."
    - content: "Escape them with a backslash, like `\\*` or `\\_`."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. You can also escape other reserved characters, including `{` and `#`, using backslashes."
    - content: "Unfortunately, this isn't supported at this time."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This question was written in Markdown and uses those characters, so it's definitely possible."
  - content: "Suppose there's an HTML snippet that you want to include on your GitHub Pages web site, but Markdown doesn't offer a way to render it. What should you do?"
    choices:
    - content: "Just add the HTML inline."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Markdown isn't a complete replacement for HTML. You might need to add HTML to get the final results you're looking for."
    - content: "Cut the content. If it's not supported in Markdown, then it's probably not worth including."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. You can include HTML snippets in Markdown."
    - content: "Open an issue that requests Markdown support for your specialized scenario."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This path would offer a low chance for success. Why not just put the HTML inline?"
