This exercise allows you to practice the content covered in this module: using Markdown to communicate effectively on GitHub.

## Get started

When you select the **Start the exercise on GitHub** button below, you're directed to a public GitHub template repository that prompts you to complete a series of small challenges. Before you can begin the exercise, complete the following tasks:

- Select the **Start course** button or the **Use this template** feature within the template repository. This prompts you to create a new repository. We recommend creating a public repository, because private repositories use Actions minutes. After you make your own repository from the template, wait about 20 seconds and refresh.

- Follow the instructions in the repository's README file to understand how the exercise works, its learning objectives, and how to successfully complete the exercise.

When you finish the exercise in GitHub, return here to:
