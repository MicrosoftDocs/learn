The goal of this module was to help you understand how GitHub Enterprise can simplify some of your duties as a GitHub administrator. GitHub Enterprise includes tools for streamlining the operations of large organizations such as managing the increased administrative workload that comes with greater headcount.

In this module, you learned how to:

- Set up authentication with Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) single sign-on and a connection between Enterprise Server and Enterprise Cloud with GitHub Connect.
- Automate security and version updates for your project's dependencies, as well as administrative duties and user interactions with GitHub.
- Interact with GitHub Enterprise Support to resolve issues with accounts, security, and abuse.
- Recognize the capabilities of centrally managing your GitHub enterprise members through GitHub Enterprise Managed User accounts (EMUs).
