As your organization's GitHub administrator, one of your responsibilities is to take advantage of the tools GitHub provides to both businesses large and small. GitHub Enterprise creates a custom environment where you can package software development tools and features together to improve the daily operations within your organization.

Suppose your organization lands a major software development contract. It needs to expand its workforce and capabilities right away. However, with greater headcount comes more authentication and more code that requires review for critical errors and vulnerabilities. Your organization's leaders decide that GitHub's Enterprise package provides the necessary enhanced service. As an administrator, you need to assist with the setup of the Enterprise automation and upkeep tools.

In this module, you learn about some GitHub Enterprise features that can make your administrative duties easier.
