          explanation: "The README provides information on how to use the project."
        - content: The issues list
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Existing issues with the project are listed here. They're also labeled according to help needed."
        - content: The search bar
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "The search bar allows you to find repositories and topics in GitHub."
        - content: The LICENSE file
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "The LICENSE file describes how you can use, redistribute, and modify the project."
    - content: What is the preferred way to ask for help or reviews on a pull request?
      choices:
        - content: Send a negative or disrespectful comment to the project's maintainers via social media.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Always be courteous when you communicate with maintainers, and keep in mind that most open-source projects are run on their free time."
        - content: Create an issue
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Issues are useful to open up a discussion about a new subject or raise a bug, but you already have a place for doing that with your pull request."
        - content: Add comment in the pull request
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "You can either directly request a review or add a comment to your pull request to discuss anything about it."
        - content: Send an email to a random committer on the project
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Contacting maintainers via their private inbox isn't an effective means of discussing an open-source project. Always use the public communication channels indicated by the project."

      choices:
        - content: Send a patch file to maintainers via email
          isCorrect: false

        - content: Clone a repo, commit changes, and force push
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "While you can clone any public GitHub repository, by default you don't have the right to push any modifications. Fork the repository to create your own copy first."
        - content: Get accepted as a team member

          explanation: "You don't need to be part of the project's team to propose a pull request."

          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "While you can clone any public GitHub repository, by default you don't have the right to push any modifications. Fork the repository to create your own copy first."
