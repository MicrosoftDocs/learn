## Outline the units

1. **Introduction**

    You have been using open-source libraries for your projects and at work for quite some time. In the spirit of the open-source community, you have decided to contribute back to some of these libraries and frameworks. You first need to find a project to contribute to on GitHub as well as familiarize yourself with the project and its community standards. You will also need to identify tasks that you can help with. You also need to familiarize with best practices to submit your contributions.
    As you contribute to the project, you realize that you will also need to communicate with the project's maintainers, ask for help and review your contributions. You might want to immerse yourself in the project's community further and connect with other contributors.
    And as you contribute to one project, you might find other projects could also benefit from a similar feature or API, and you might release an open-source project yourself. We just made a full circle!

2. **Identify where and how you can help open-source projects** [Tania]

    List the content that will enable the learner to *Identify where and how to help open-source projects*:

    - Finding open-source projects on GitHub
      - Searching for repositories on GitHub
      - Search for topics associated with repositories on GitHub
    - Things to look for in a project before getting started
      - Contribution guidelines
      - Code of Conduct
      - Communication channels
    - Searching issues and pull requests
      - Issues labels
      - Identify issues needing help
      - Search by title, body, or comments
      - Find linked issues or pull requests
    - Sponsoring projects
      - Introduction to GitHub sponsors

3. **How to contribute to an open-source repository** [Yohan]

    List the content that will enable the learner to *Contribute to an open-source repository*:

    - Describe how to communicate with project maintainers
        - Comment an issue
        - Other communication channels
    - Create a pull request on a GitHub repository
        - Fork the project
        - Create a branch (optional)
        - Commit and push changes
        - Make sure the contribution guidelines are respected
        - Create the PR on GitHub
    - Best practices when asking for help or pull requests reviews
        - PR edits and comments
        - Details about your issue
        - Patience

4. **Exercise - Create your first Pull Request** [Floor]

    - Pick up an issue by commenting on it
    - Fork the repository
    - Clone your fork to your machine
    - Create a branch (optional)
    - Make your changes in the branch and commit with a descriptive message
    - Merge with your main branch (Note Yohan: not sure about this one)
    - Push your code upstream
    - Create a PR referencing the original issue, context

5. **Going further with communities** [Floor]

    List the content that will enable the learner to *go further with communities*:

    - Find open-source communities
        - Look for (talk recordings of past) meetups, conferences
        - Find core contributors to a project, follow them on GitHub, other channels they provide
        - Find communication channels on the project website / in the README
    - Find opportunities for code reusability across projects
        - If you solved a very scoped issue for one project, chances are other projects can benefit from it as well
        - Publish as a stand-alone library, mirror the project with your added functionality, or create a GitHub Action (link to Learn module)

6. **Knowledge check**

    What types of questions will test *learning objective*? *[(Knowledge check guidance)](https://review.docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn-docs/docs/id-guidance-knowledge-check)*

 - What is the best place on a GitHub repository to find where you can help a project?
   * The README file
   * The issues list
   * The search bar
   * The LICENSE file
- What is the preferred way to ask for help or reviews on a pull request?
   * Yell at the maintainers on Twitter
   * Create an issue
   * Add comment in the pull request
   * Send an email to a random committer on the project
- What is needed before creating a pull request on GitHub?
   * Send a patch file to maintainers via email
   * Clone a repo, commit changes and force push
   * Read contribution guidelines
   * Fork a repo, clone it, commit changes and push

7. **Summary**

    How did you solve the problem in the initial scenario with the knowledge learned in the module?

    You wanted to get started with contributing to open-source projects.
    In this module, we covered how you can find projects in GitHub to contribute to as well as tasks needing help from community contributors like you. You also learned how to familiarize yourself with the project and its contribution guidelines, making your engagement with the project smooth and fruitful for you and the maintainers. Finally, you also learned best practices on how to communicate effectively with project maintainers and conduct code reviews. The primary goal for open-source contributions is to make the whole open-source ecosystem sustainable in the long-term. As you contribute to a particular project, you will also find yourself identifying and joining intersectional communities and projects. In this module, you learned some of the essential skills needed to contribute to open-source and its community in a meaningful way!
