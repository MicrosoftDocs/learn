# Enterprise Permissions and Policies via Ruleset
This unit covers how to manage enterprise permissions and policies through rulesets. We'll explore best practices for structuring organizations, setting default permissions, synchronizing teams via Active Directory (AD), automating multi-org scripting, and aligning policies with your companyâ€™s trust and control positions.

## Weighing the pros and cons of deploying a single versus multiple organizations
When structuring your enterprise, one of the key decisions is whether to use a single organization or multiple organizations. Each approach has unique benefits and trade-offs.

### Single Organization

| Pros                        | Cons                                      |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Simplified Management:** Centralized control of permissions and policies. | **Limited Flexibility:** One-size-fits-all policies might not suit all teams. |
| **Consistency:** Uniform application of rules and streamlined collaboration. | **Security Risks:** A single breach could impact the entire organization. |
| **Resource Sharing:** Easier asset sharing across teams. | **Scalability Issues:** Managing permissions can become complex as the organization grows. |
| **Cost Efficiency:** Reduced overhead in administrative tooling and licensing. | |

### Multiple Organizations

| Pros                        | Cons                                      |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Tailored Policies:** Customize permissions to fit the specific needs of each team. | **Increased Complexity:** More organizations mean more administrative overhead. |
| **Enhanced Isolation:** Limits the impact of a security breach to a single organization. | **Redundancy:** Potential duplication of settings and management efforts. |
| **Decentralized Administration:** Teams can manage their own policies and permissions. | **Inter-Org Collaboration:** May require extra tools or processes for cross-organization projects. |

## Setting default read versus default write across organizations
Deciding on the default permission level is critical to balancing security and collaboration within your enterprise.
### Default Read vs Default Write

| Default Read                                    | Default Write                                    |
|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| **Enhanced Security:** Minimizes the risk of unintended modifications. | **Improved Collaboration:** Empowers users to contribute and modify content directly. |
| **Control:** Easier to audit and monitor changes. | **Efficiency:** Reduces bottlenecks in content creation and updates. |
| **Best For:** Environments where the majority of users only need to view resources. | **Risks:** Increases the chance of accidental changes or misconfigurations if not carefully managed. |

**Recommendation:**
Use a default read permission model and grant write access selectively, ensuring adherence to the principle of least privilege.

## Team synchronization through Active Directory (AD)
Using Active Directory (AD) for team synchronization makes user management and access control easier and more efficient.

### Why use AD sync?
- **Single source of truth:** Keeps user identities consistent across your organization.  
- **Automated access management:** Streamlines onboarding, offboarding, and role updates.  
- **Seamless role alignment:** Ensures AD groups match enterprise roles and permissions.  

### Things to consider before implementing
- **Role mapping:** Clearly define how AD groups align with your organization's roles.  
- **Sync frequency:** Set a schedule that balances performance and security.  
- **Compliance & auditing:** Log all changes to meet compliance requirements.  

By planning ahead, you can ensure a smooth integration that keeps your organization secure and well-organized.

## Maintainability: scripting for multiple organizations and access rights
As your enterprise scales, automating the management of permissions across multiple organizations is essential for maintainability.

### Key Practices:
Automating the management of permissions across multiple organizations is crucial for maintaining efficiency and security as your enterprise grows. This section provides key practices for scripting and automation to ensure consistent and scalable permission management. By following these practices, you can streamline administrative tasks, reduce manual errors, and maintain a secure and well-organized environment.

- **Modularity:** Develop scripts in modular components to handle different organizations with minimal changes.
- **Reusability:** Create reusable functions or modules to perform common permission tasks.
- **Testing:** Thoroughly test scripts in a controlled environment before deployment.
- **Logging:** Implement detailed logging to track changes and facilitate troubleshooting.
- **Version Control:** Use version control systems (like Git) to manage script revisions and collaborate with team members.
