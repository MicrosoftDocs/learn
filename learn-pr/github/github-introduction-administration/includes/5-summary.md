The goal of this module was to help you develop a mental model of the roles and responsibilities of users who perform GitHub administrative tasks for companies. 

GitHub supplies administrators with the tools they can use flexibly to control and protect their company's GitHub usage. Administrators can set up authentication schemes and enforce organization-wide or enterprise-wide policies, and design cascading permission structures that represent the natural groupings within the company.

Hierarchical levels like teams, organizations, and enterprises enable ways of setting up and controlling authentication and other security measures. Permission levels allow for fine-grained control of specific tasks. Repository permissions apply to individual users or teams of users, and cascade to child teams.

Without these types of administrative controls, it would be impossible to adequately secure a company's GitHub implementation.

GitHub administrators perform vital tasks that ensure the security and viability of company repositories.
