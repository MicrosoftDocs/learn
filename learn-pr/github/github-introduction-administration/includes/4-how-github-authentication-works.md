In the previous unit, you learned about typical administration tasks at the team, organization, and enterprise level. In this unit, you'll deep dive into one of the most common administrative tasks performed by organization owners, which is setting up and controlling users' authentication to GitHub.

## GitHub's authentication options

There are several options for authenticating with GitHub:

### Username and password

Administrators can allow users to continue using the default username and password authentication method, sometimes known as the "basic" HTTP authentication scheme. In recent years, basic authentication has proven to be too risky when dealing with highly sensitive information. We strongly recommend using one (or several) of the other options listed in this unit.

### Personal access tokens

Personal access tokens (PATs) are an alternative to using passwords for authentication to GitHub when using the GitHub API or the command line. Users generate a token via the GitHub's settings option, and tie the token permissions to a repository or organization. When users interact with GitHub by using the git command-line tool, they can enter the token information when they're asked for their username and password.

### SSH keys

As an alternative to using personal access tokens, users can connect and authenticate to remote servers and services via SSH with the help of SSH keys. SSH keys eliminate the need for users to supply their username and personal access token for every interaction.

When setting up SSH, users generate an SSH key, add it to the ssh-agent, and then add the key to their GitHub account. Adding the SSH key to the ssh-agent ensures that the SSH key has a passphrase as an extra layer of security. Users can configure their local copy of git to automatically supply the passphrase, or they can supply it manually each time they use the git command-line tool to interact with GitHub.

You can even use SSH keys with a repository owned by an organization that uses SAML single sign-on (SSO). If the organization provides SSH certificates, users can also use it to access the organization's repositories without adding the certificate to their GitHub account.

### Deploy keys

Deploy keys are another type of SSH key in GitHub that grants a user access to a single repository. GitHub attaches the public part of the key directly to the repository instead of a personal user account, and the private part of the key remains on the user's server. Deploy keys are read-only by default, but you can give them write access when adding them to a repository.

## GitHub's added security options

GitHub also offers the following extra security options.

### Two-factor authentication

Two-factor authentication (2FA), sometimes known as multifactor authentication (MFA), is an extra layer of security used when logging into websites or apps. With 2FA, users have to sign in with their username and password and provide another form of authentication that only they have access to.

For GitHub, the second form of authentication is a code generated by an application on a user's mobile device or sent as a text message (SMS). After a user enables 2FA, GitHub generates an authentication code anytime someone attempts to sign into their GitHub account. Users can only sign into their account if they know their password and have access to the authentication code on their phone.

Organization owners can require organization members, outside collaborators, and billing managers to enable 2FA for their personal accounts. This action makes it harder for malicious actors to access an organization's repositories and settings.

Enterprise owners can also enforce certain security policies for all organizations owned by an enterprise account.

### SAML SSO

If you centrally manage your users' identities and applications with an IdP, you can configure SAML SSO to protect your organization's resources on GitHub.

This type of authentication gives organization and enterprise owners on GitHub a way to control and secure access to organization resources like repositories, issues, and pull requests. Organization owners can invite GitHub users to join the organization that uses SAML SSO, which allows those users to contribute to the organization and retain their existing identity and contributions on GitHub.

When users access resources within an organization that uses SAML SSO, GitHub will redirect them to the organization's SAML IdP for authentication. After they successfully authenticate with their account on the IdP, the IdP redirects to GitHub to access the organization's resources.

GitHub offers limited support for all identity providers that implement the SAML 2.0 standard with official support for several popular identity providers including:

- Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS).
- Microsoft Entra ID.
- Okta.
- OneLogin.
- PingOne.

### LDAP

Lightweight directory access protocol (LDAP) is a popular application protocol for accessing and maintaining directory information services. LDAP lets you authenticate GitHub Enterprise Server against your existing accounts and centrally manage repository access. It's one of the most common protocols used to integrate third-party software with large company user directories.

GitHub Enterprise Server integrates with popular LDAP services like:

- Active Directory.
- Oracle Directory Server Enterprise Edition.
- OpenLDAP.
- Open Directory.
