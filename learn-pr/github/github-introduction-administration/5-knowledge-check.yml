    - content: "The maintain permission on a repository"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The maintain permission on a repository only allows you to perform limited administration-related tasks on a specific repository; it doesn't affect membership on a team."
    - content: "Organization billing manager"

    choices:
    - content: "Single sign-on"
      isCorrect: true

    - content: "Two-factor authentication"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Two-factor authentication requires each user to sign in by using a second means of identifying themselves, like using an authenticator app on their phones."
    - content: "Personal Access Tokens"
      isCorrect: false

      explanation: "Incorrect. SSH keys provide access for the git client through a username and password. You don't use them to access the GitHub website."
  - content: "What's the appropriate repository permission level for contributors who need to actively push changes to your repository?"
    choices:
    - content: "admin"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The admin permission isn't appropriate because it provides too much access to the administration functions of the repository."
    - content: "write"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! The write permission is the appropriate permission level."
    - content: "triage"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The triage permission is for contributors who need to proactively manage issues and pull requests without making changes."
    - content: "maintain"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The maintain permission is for contributors who need to manage the repository without access to sensitive or destructive actions. It provides too much access for other users."
