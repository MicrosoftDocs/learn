quiz:
  title: "Knowledge check"
  questions:
  - content: "**Which HDInsight cluster configuration type would be appropriate to fulfill the streaming requirements needed by the connected bicycle scenario?**"
    choices:
    - content: "Apache Interactive Query"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The correct answer is Apache Kafka. Apache Interactive Query provides in-memory caching for interactive and faster Hive queries. Apache Kafka is an open-source platform used for building streaming data pipelines and applications."
    - content: "Apache HBase"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The correct answer is Apache Kafka. Apache HBase is a NoSQL database built on Hadoop that provides random access and strong consistency for large amounts of unstructured and semi-structured data."
    - content: "Apache Kafka"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "The correct answer is Apache Kafka. Apache Kafka is an open-source platform used for building streaming data pipelines and applications."
  - content: "**Which HDInsight cluster configuration type would be appropriate to house the data analysis performed by the data warehouse on the on-premises SQL Server?**"
    choices:
    - content: "Apache Hadoop with Hive"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "The correct answer is Apache Hadoop with Hive.  Apache Hadoop is a framework that uses HDFS, and a simple MapReduce programming model to process and analyze batch data. Hive facilitates managing large datasets residing in distributed storage using SQL."
    - content: "Apache Spark with Mahout"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The correct answer is Apache Hadoop with Hive. Apache Spark is an open-source, parallel-processing framework that supports in-memory processing to boost the performance of big-data analysis applications. Mahout is an algebra framework to create your own algorithms."
    - content: "Apache HBase with MapReduce"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The correct answer is Apache Hadoop with Hive. Apache HBase is a NoSQL database built on Hadoop that provides random access and strong consistency for large amounts of unstructured and semi-structured data. MapReduce is a framework for easily writing applications, which process vast amounts of data."
  - content: "**Which HDInsight cluster configuration type would be the appropriate type to perform the predictive maintenance work in Bicycle Maintenance Service?**"
    choices:
    - content: "Apache Hadoop"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The correct answer is Apache Spark. Apache Hadoop is a framework that uses HDFS, and a simple MapReduce programming model to process and analyze batch data."
    - content: "Apache Spark"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "The correct answer is Apache Spark, which is an open-source, parallel-processing framework that supports in-memory processing to boost the performance of big-data analysis applications."
    - content: "Apache HBase"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The correct answer is Apache Spark. Apache HBase is a NoSQL database built on Hadoop that provides random access and strong consistency for large amounts of unstructured and semi-structured data."
  - content: "**To fulfill all of the scenarios outlined in the previous questions, which data storage type should be used to handle all of these workloads?**"
    choices:
    - content: "Azure Blob Storage"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The correct answer is Azure Data Lake Gen2 as it's the recommended storage platform for Spark and Hadoop, and being the default choice for HBase. Azure Blob Storage can be used for scenarios where Azure Data Lake Gen2 can't be used."
    - content: "Azure Data Lake Gen1"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The correct answer is Azure Data Lake Gen2 as it's the recommended storage platform for Spark and Hadoop, and being the default choice for HBase. Azure Data Lake Gen1 isn't recommended."
    - content: "Azure Data Lake Gen2"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "The correct answer is Azure Data Lake Gen2 as it's the recommended storage platform for Spark and Hadoop, and being the default choice for HBase."
