The Govern methodology helps you maintain cosistent control and address tangible risks across your portfolio of workloads. The Govern methodology provides a structured approach that you can use to establish and optimize governance in Azure. The Govern methodology consists of five steps:

- Build a cloud governance team.
- Assess cloud risks.
- Document cloud governance policies.
- Enforce cloud governance policies.
- Monitor cloud governance.

Build a cloud governance team. Select a small, diverse team to encourage quick decision-making and include various perspectives. Define the functions, authority, and scope of your team.

Before you create new policies or update existing policies, you need to assess cloud risks to help define the new or updated policy. To effectively assess risks in the cloud:

- Identify risks and catalog them. Use Azure tools to list cloud assets and discover cloud risks.

- Analyze risks and assign a qualitative or quantitative value to each risk. Prioritize the risks by severity.

- Determine the impact of a risk, for example downtime or cost.

- Document risks, and inform all necessary parties in your organization about the risks.

- Review risks regularly and in response to events to ensure that they remain valid and accurate.

After you identify business risks that are associated with the cloud, you must document or update policies to mitigate the risks. Healthy cloud governance strategy begins with sound cloud governance policy.

Cloud governance policies establish the requirements, standards, and goals that your IT staff and automated systems must align with. Individual policy statements are guidelines that you can use to address specific risks that you identify during your risk analysis. Define an approach to document your policies, including how to create, maintain, and update rules that govern the use of your cloud services. Add policies to a centralized repository to inform everyone who needs to adhere to the policies.

To enforce cloud governance, incorporate controls and procedures to align cloud use to your cloud governance policies. Use cloud governance tools to automate compliance on a small set of policies and then add more policies. To ensure a smooth transition to enforcement, do the following tasks:

- Delegate governance responsibilities.
- Adopt an inheritance model for policies.
- Apply tagging and naming conventions to the resources in the inheritance model.
- Implement a monitor-first approach.

After you establish your policies and align your organization's processes and procedures to the policies, you must monitor your cloud governance. Use monitoring to determine areas that lack compliance and make changes to reduce noncompliance problems. Configure alerts to notify teams or individuals about deviations from your governance policies. Define clear thresholds that trigger the alerts to the appropriate people. Develop a remediation plan to quickly address violations, and prioritize high-risk problems. To prevent future occurrences, update your governance policies and enforcement mechanisms.
