    choices:
    - content: "Plan, Business Justification, and Implementation."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Business Justification and Implementation are not main stages of the Cloud Adoption Framework."
    - content: "Migrate, Test, and Optimize."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Migrate, Test, and Optimize are not main stages of the Cloud Adoption Framework."

  - content: "Motivations for cloud adoption include migration and innovation triggers. Migration triggers include such things as cost saving and operations optimization. Which of the following is an example of an innovation trigger which drives cloud adoption?"
    choices:
    - content: "Reduction in IT staff for on-premises hardware."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Reduction in IT staff is not an innovation trigger, but optimization of internal operations can be a migration trigger."
    - content: "Transform products or services."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. The desire to transform products or services might be an innovation trigger which drives cloud adoption."
    - content: "Increase business agility."

  - content: "What are the five disciplines of cloud governance?"
    choices:
    - content: "Business risk, process, policy and compliance, resource consistency, and deployment acceleration."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Business risk, process, and policy compliance are required for governance, but they are not one of the five disciplines."

      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. These are important tasks in any cloud adoption but are not part of the five disciplines of cloud governance."
    - content: "Cost management, security baseline, resource consistency, identity baseline, and deployment acceleration."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. When you build your cloud governance strategy, you need to think about cost management, setting a security baseline, working toward resource consistency through best practices, establishing the identity and access strategy, and accelerating deployment with consistent templates."
  - content: "The common value drivers that business decision makers can use to justify moving their business to the cloud are Cost, Scale, Productivity, and Reliability. What is the specific value of scale in cloud computing?"
    choices:
    - content: "Scale is the ability to deliver the right amount of IT resources."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Scale is the ability to scale elastically and deliver the right amount of IT resources."
    - content: "Scale eliminates capital expense."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That’s incorrect. Cost, not Scale, is the cloud computing business value area which eliminates capital expense."
    - content: "Scale eases the burden of data backup, disaster recovery, and business continuity."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Reliability, not Scale, eases the burden of data backup, disaster recovery, and business continuity."
  - content: "Financial planning for cloud adoption requires organizations to decide whether to expand on-premises capabilities or move certain workloads and functions off-premises to cloud-delivered services. Microsoft has tools that can help. What Microsoft tool is available for a CFO who's trying to estimate the expected monthly bill and track actual account usage?"
    choices:
    - content: "The Azure Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) Calculator."

      explanation: "That's incorrect. Organizations can use the Azure TCO Calculator to estimate the cost savings they can realize by migrating their application workloads to Azure."
    - content: "The Azure Pricing Calculator."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Organizations can estimate their expected monthly bills by using the pricing calculator to track their actual account usage and bills at any time on the billing portal."
    - content: "Microsoft Cost Management."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Organizations can use the Microsoft Cost Management tool to use and manage Azure and other cloud resources through a multiple-cloud cost management solution."
