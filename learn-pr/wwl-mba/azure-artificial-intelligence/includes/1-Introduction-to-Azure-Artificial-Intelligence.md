## What is Artificial Intelligence?

Artificial intelligence (AI) is the capability of a machine to imitate intelligent human behavior: from analyzing, to learning, reasoning, and problem-solving, and more. Through AI, machines can analyze data, text, and images, comprehend speech, interact in natural ways, and make predictions using data—such as when a machine needs maintenance, or what type of product a customer might want to purchase.

As we saw in the video, AI is changing the world of agriculture, healthcare, and much more.  In the next section we will look at why to use Azure for AI.

## Azure AI

### Why Azure for AI?

Azure is a flexible platform that allows your organization to take advantage of Microsoft AI services and capabilities. You can build the next generation of smart applications where your data lives: in the cloud, on-premises, and with your devices on the intelligent edge.

Only Azure empowers you with:

- Decades of breakthrough research achieving human parity in vision, speech, and language.
- AI technology that Microsoft runs on.
- The most comprehensive compliance and security offerings.
