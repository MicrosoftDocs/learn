Creating new value for customers is essential to maintaining a competitive advantage in today’s business environment. Microsoft solutions, including Microsoft 365, Dynamics 365, and Azure, have the unique ability to support and scale any organization’s digital transformation. Within modern workplace solutions, Microsoft 365 includes Windows 10 and Office 365, which provide the most secure and reliable way to maximize productivity and manage devices. The Microsoft Business Application solutions consist of Microsoft Dynamics 365 and Microsoft Power Platform. Azure is the most trusted and certified cloud platform. These products help companies unleash their potential by breaking down data silos and enabling data-driven insights to connect and grow employees, customers, operations, and products. Microsoft can help with strategically moving data and infrastructure to the cloud, enabling AI, business intelligence (BI), and IoT, and supporting a hybrid cloud solution. 

The power of our solution areas is when they come together – for you. We start by understanding your business priorities and then align Microsoft solutions to enable digital transformation across our four pillars. Now, let’s see how two companies are adopting Microsoft solutions to achieve their own digital transformation. In the process they are empowering employees, engaging customers, optimizing operations, and transforming products.

### The role of Microsoft in The Carlsberg Group’s digital transformation

**The company:** The Carlsberg Group is one of the world’s leading breweries.

**The need for digital transformation:** Carlsberg experienced significant growth in the last two decades, growing from four small markets in 2000 to 80 breweries today, with more than 40,000 employees across 27 countries. To create local favorites while maintaining global consistency and quality, Carlsberg needed to deploy a global collaboration solution to streamline processes, enable efficient teamwork, and continue to build its brand.

**The business outcomes:** Carlsberg adopted the Microsoft 365 modern workplace solution to enable seamless collaboration and teamwork for product development, globally. Regardless of location, Carlsberg employees can share brewing recipes and ideas, build the company’s collective creativity and enhance the quality of their brand while ensuring the consistency their customers have come to expect.

Additionally, Carlsberg sales representatives are now able to work more efficiently as they engage with customers to build relationships and sell more beer. Previously representatives who visited customers carried laptops, paper marketing materials, and order forms. Now they are able to focus on their customer interactions as they have the information they need at their fingertips, thanks to Microsoft 365 for iOS on iPad, SharePoint Online, and the company’s Retail Sales Execution (REX) system, all running on one device.

The introduction to Microsoft 365 also played an integral role in streamlining Carlsberg’s global operations to help create a single organization overseeing product supply to all markets. Microsoft 365 allowed them to easily share project plans, documents, and dashboards, as well as cut back on travel expenses since they were able to work effectively from home.

Now that you understand how a modern workplace solution from Microsoft helped The Carlsberg Group empower employees, engage customers, and optimize operations, let’s see how Ørsted is leveraging Microsoft 365, a business application solution, and Microsoft Azure to empower employees, optimize operations, and transform products.

### The role of Microsoft in Ørsted’s digital transformation

**The company:** Ørsted builds, owns, and operates large-scale wind turbine installations deep in the ocean that provide power to 11.3 million people, roughly a quarter of the world’s offshore wind market.

**The need for digital transformation:** Ørsted wants to be a world leader in green energy. The wind farms are part of their shift away from fossil fuels and toward renewable energy. Ørsted plans to fully phase out coal by 2023 and wants to increase its offshore wind capacity to 15 gigawatts by 2025—enough to power more than 30 million people. To make the transition to reliable, renewable energy, Ørsted needed to employ solutions that enabled them to process massive amounts of data, maintain a connection to their offshore turbine installations, and foster collaboration among their employees.

**The business outcomes:** To reach its goals, Ørsted developed a digital strategy that includes Azure IoT, AI and advanced analytics with Power BI, and Microsoft 365.

Microsoft solutions help Ørsted optimize its operations by transforming data from its 1,300 offshore wind turbines into insights for predictive maintenance that save time and resources. Furthermore, the company is transforming their products and making it faster to build new wind farms.

Finally, Ørsted has put its employees at the center of their transformation with Microsoft 365. Modern, cloud-based tools are helping Ørsted’s 5,900 employees work and collaborate more efficiently.

Just like The Carlsberg Group and Ørsted, organizations around the globe in industries ranging from manufacturing and energy production to healthcare, retail, financial services, and more are seeking new ways to empower employees, engage customers, optimize operations, and transform products. Microsoft solutions have the unique ability to help change how value is created for businesses.
