IT staff at Contoso were concerned that their Azure web apps could be subjected to attacks using common exploits, such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting. You were asked to evaluate whether Azure Web Application Firewall would be a good choice to protect Contoso's web apps from such attacks.

In this module, you learned that Azure Web Application Firewall creates a barrier between your web apps and their HTTP requests. You learned that Azure Web Application Firewall maintains a large set of rules that can detect and deny common web app security holes.

Yes, it's possible to write frontend and backend code to deter the vulnerabilities that plague modern web apps. However, there are hundreds of possible exploits to consider. Writing the code to manage a single vulnerability takes a great deal of time and requires specialized expertise. And with threat actors constantly inventing new exploits, protecting web apps in-house requires a significant commitment and a large budget.

You can deploy Azure Web Application Firewall in minutes, and your web apps instantly get powerful protection from hundreds of common exploits. Microsoft's security experts manage your core rule set, and you can adjust the protection as needed with custom rules.
