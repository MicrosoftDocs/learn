Azure Firewall protects your Azure Virtual Network by allowing you to control and monitor access to Azure resources. Azure Firewall Manager provides a central point of configuration and management of multiple Azure Firewall instances.

Suppose you work at Contoso, Ltd., a financial-services company in Seattle with major offices located throughout the world. Contoso's compute environment is spread across multiple Azure regions, each with multiple virtual networks and a connection to an on-premises network.

Contoso IT staff is concerned about external threats in the form of malicious actors attempting to infiltrate the network. IT is also concerned about internal threats in the form of employees inadvertently attempting to access malicious websites. Suppose you're a Contoso network security engineer. You’re responsible for determining whether Azure Firewall enables Contoso to deny incoming and outgoing threats while also allowing legitimate traffic. Your mandate also includes finding the most efficient way to implement firewall policies across Contoso's multiple Azure regions.

In this module, you learn the fundamentals of Azure Firewall, Azure Firewall Premium, and Azure Firewall Manager. You learn what they are, how they work, and when you should use them. By the end of this module, you can evaluate whether Azure Firewall is a suitable solution for controlling and monitoring access to Contoso's virtual resources. You'll also be able to evaluate whether Azure Firewall Manager can help reduce the complexity of deploying policies to multiple firewalls.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you’ll:

- Explain how Azure Firewall and Azure Firewall Manager work together to protect Azure Virtual Networks.
- Evaluate whether Azure Firewall is the right solution to protect your Azure virtual networks from malicious incoming and outgoing traffic.
- Evaluate whether Azure Firewall Premium is the right solution to protect your Azure virtual networks from malicious incoming and outgoing traffic.
- Evaluate whether Azure Firewall Manager is the right solution for deploying policies across multiple firewalls.
- Identify and describe use cases for Azure Firewall, Azure Firewall Premium, and Azure Firewall Manager.
