Front Door listens on an endpoint and matches incoming requests to a route. Then, it forwards these requests to the best available origin. The routing configuration you define, determines how Front Door processes a request *at the edge* before it's forwarded to the origin.

Information that is processed at the edge includes:

- Protocols that the route accepts.
- Paths to match.
- Redirecting traffic to HTTPS.
- Determining the origin group that serves the request.
- Setting the protocol used to forward the request.
- Using the cache if it's enabled.
- Using rule sets to process a request further before forwarding to the origin.

In the motor vehicle department system, you need to configure Front Door to access the web servers hosting the Vehicle registration application privately using Private Link. You also need to configure Front Door to access the App service hosting the License renewal website using Private Link. The Azure Front Door profile has an endpoint with two routes, each configured to route traffic to the correct website. Lastly, you configure a security policy containing a WAF policy to protect your web applications from malicious attacks and intruders.

This exercise walks you through creating a Front Door profile, configuring origins in an origin group, setting up routes and applying a security policy. Then, you test each route to verify Front Door is handling each request correctly.

## Create an Azure Front Door

In this unit, you create a Front Door named `vehicleFrontDoor` with the following configuration:

* Two origin groups. The first origin group contains the service endpoint IP of the web servers virtual machines. The second origin group contains the App service. You also enable private link access to these origins.
* Approve private endpoint connections for the web servers and App service.
* Create an endpoint in the Front Door profile with two routes configured to direct requests to a Vehicle registration website and a License renewal website.
* A security policy containing a WAF policy to block malicious requests.

1. Create the Azure Front Door profile with the following command:

    ```azurecli
    az afd profile create \
        --profile-name vehicleFrontDoor \
        --resource-group $RG \
        --sku Premium_AzureFrontDoor
    ```

1. Create the first endpoint within the profile with the following command:

    ```azurecli
    endpoint="vehicle-$RANDOM"
    az afd endpoint create \
        --endpoint-name $endpoint \
        --profile-name vehicleFrontDoor \
        --resource-group $RG
    ```

## Create origin groups and add origins

1. Sign into the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/learn.docs.microsoft.com?azure-portal=true) to complete the setup of the Front Door profile. Make sure to use the same account you activated the sandbox with.

1. Go to the `vehicleFrontDoor` Front Door profile you created and select **Origin Groups** from under *Settings* in the left menu pane.

### Approve private endpoint connections

1. After enabling private link service for the origin resources, you'll need to approve the private endpoint connection request before the private connection can be established. To approve connectivity for the *web servers*, locate the Private link service resource you created in an earlier unit named **myPrivateLinkService**. Select **Private endpoint connections** from under *Settings* on the left side menu pane.

1. Select the pending connection with the description of *webServer private connection* and select **Approve**. Then select **Yes** to confirm approval to establish the connection.

    :::image type="content" source="./../media/5-approve-web-server-private-endpoint.png" alt-text="Screenshot of private endpoint connection approval list for web servers.":::

1. You don't need to approve private endpoint for the App Service since the connectivity is over the public internet.

### Add routes

Here you add two routes to direct traffic to the Vehicle registration web site and the License renewal website.

1. Go to the **Front Door manager** for the *vehicleFrontDoor* profile. Select **+ Add a route** from the endpoint you created in step 2.

    :::image type="content" source="./../media/5-manager.png" alt-text="Screenshot of add a route button from Front Door manager.":::

1. Select or enter the following information, then select **Add** to create the first route for the Vehicle registration website.

## Create a security policy

To protect the motor vehicle websites, you configure a Web Application Firewall (WAF) policy on the endpoint by applying a security policy.

1. From the Front Door manager, select **+ Add a policy** for the endpoint. Enter **securityPolicy** for the name and then from the drop-down, select the domain.

1. Select **Create New** to create a new WAF Policy. Name the WAF policy **frontdoorWAF**, then select **Save** to apply the WAF policy to the endpoint.

    :::image type="content" source="./../media/5-add-security-policy.png" alt-text="Screenshot of adding security policy containing WAF policy settings.":::

### Configure WAF policy

1. Go to the **frontdoorWAF** resource you created in the last step. From the *Overview*, select **Switch to prevention mode** to start blocking malicious traffic.

    :::image type="content" source="./../media/5-switch-prevention.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the switch to prevention mode button from overview page of WAF policy.":::

1. Select **Policy settings** under *Settings* from the left side pane to configure the policy settings for this WAF policy.

    :::image type="content" source="./../media/5-policy-settings.png" alt-text="Screenshot of policy settings button from under settings for WAF policy.":::

1. To quickly determine if the WAF policy is working, set the *Block response status code* to **999**, and then select **Save** to apply the new policy settings.

    :::image type="content" source="./../media/5-response-code.png" alt-text="Screenshot of updating response code for blocked requests.":::

With the Front Door profile all configured, it's time to test by sending requests to it.
