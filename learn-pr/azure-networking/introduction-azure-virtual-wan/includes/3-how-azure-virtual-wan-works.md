## Service components of Azure Virtual WAN

The following services and components of Azure Virtual WAN provide multiple connectivity options into Azure and permit customers to use the Azure high-speed connected backbone.

- **The virtual hub**: All traffic flows through these fully meshed hubs. An address space and routing tables are provided at creation.
- **Hub-to-Hub connections**: Enable cross-region connectivity between all on-premises and Azure network endpoints.
- **Virtual hub router**: Supports custom route tables for virtual networks. Acts as default route table for branches (P2S, S2S, ER). Associates connections to route tables and propagates routes from connections to route tables.
- **Connection between sites**: Supports:
  - Any-to-any branch to Azure
  - Branch to branch
  - Users to branch
  - Virtual network to virtual network transit
  - VPN to ExpressRoute transit connectivity.
- **Secure virtual hub**: Added security with the integration of Azure Firewall Manager to:
  - Create policy and apply across multiple firewalls
  - Work across regions/subscription/deployments
  - Secure internet traffic (virtual network to internet and branch to internet)
  - Secure private traffic (virtual network to and from a branch)
- **Secure with Security-as-a-Service (SECaaS) partners**: Supported partners that currently have integration into Azure Firewall Manager's API to set up security policies are:
  - zScaler
  - iBoss
  - Check Point  

## Virtual WAN options

Azure Virtual WAN supports two WAN types, Basic and Standard. A Basic WAN creates only Basic hubs, and a Standard WAN creates only Standard hubs. The available configurations for each WAN type are included in the following table.

| **Virtual WAN type** | **Hub type** | **Available configurations**                                 |
| :------------------- | :----------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Basic                | Basic        | Site-to-site VPN only                                        |
| Standard             | Standard     | Full-mesh connectivity, ExpressRoute, User VPN (P2S), VPN (site-to-site), Inter-hub, Virtual Network-to-Virtual Network transiting through the virtual hub |

>[!NOTE]
> You can upgrade a  Basic Virtual WAN to a Standard Virtual WAN. You can't downgrade a Standard Virtual WAN to a Basic Virtual WAN.

Azure Virtual WAN is integrated into Azure Monitor Insights, which provides a display of health and metrics for all deployed network resources.
