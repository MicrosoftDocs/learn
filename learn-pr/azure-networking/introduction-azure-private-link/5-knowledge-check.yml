  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "Suppose a company wants clients in their Azure virtual network to have secure and non-public access to a particular Azure resource. Which of the following technologies should their IT staff add to their virtual network?"
    choices:
    - content: "Azure Service Endpoint"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. When using Service Endpoint, access to the resource still uses the resource's public IP address."
    - content: "Azure Private Endpoint"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Adding a Private Endpoint to a virtual network enables clients to access an Azure resource privately."
    - content: "Azure Firewall"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Implementing a firewall doesn't change resource access from public to private."
  - content: "Suppose a company wants to give private access to Azure resources via an Azure virtual network. How does Azure Private Endpoint map an Azure resource to offer private access?"
    choices:
    - content: "By using an IP address from a subnet of an Azure virtual network."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Private Endpoint maps an unused IP address from the address space of the subnet in which it resides."
    - content: "By using a private IP address supplied by Azure."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Azure doesn't supply an IP address to Private Endpoint."
    - content: "By using Azure ExpressRoute private peering."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. ExpressRoute private peering is a technology that peers an on-premises network to an Azure virtual network."
  - content: "Suppose a company wants to offer private access to a custom Azure services via Azure Private Link Service. Which of the following technologies is a requirement for implementing Private Link Service?" 
    choices:
    - content: "Azure Application Gateway"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Application Gateway isn't a requirement for using Private Link Service."
    - content: "Azure Basic Load Balancer"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Azure's basic version of its load balancer doesn't support Private Link Service."
    - content: "Azure Standard Load Balancer"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Azure's standard version of its load balancer is the one you must use for Private Link Service."
