  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "To use both Windows and Linux on your computer, with a fully integrated file system, you should:"
    choices:
    - content: "Enable Hyper-V in your Windows Features settings; 2) Open Hyper-V Quick Create and select a Linux distribution OS; 3) Open Hyper-V Manager to name your VM and connect."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Running Linux in a VM with Hyper-V is still a viable option, but the Windows and Linux tools and file systems won't be seamlessly integrated as they are with WSL. You'll also experience better performance if you run a Linux distribution with WSL. That said, if you want more info about setting up VMs, see the [Hyper-V docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/quick-start/quick-create-virtual-machine)."
    - content: "Enable WSL in your Windows Features settings (or with a PowerShell script); 2) Install a Linux distribution from Microsoft Store; 3) Open the Linux distribution and set your account name and password."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "You were paying attention! Good job!"
    - content: "Download a Linux distribution and save it to a USB drive; 2) Reboot your machine and enter BIOS during the startup process; 3) Change the boot order to boot from your Linux distribution on the USB; 4) Install the distribution on a partition."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Changing the boot order when you start your computer can be kind of a headache, but if you want a full Linux desktop environment, dual-boot installation is an option. The [Ubuntu docs](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WindowsDualBoot) provide help with setting up a Windows dual-boot if you need to."

  - content: "You can display all the hidden files in a folder/directory by using this command in the WSL terminal:"
    choices:
    - content: "`dir`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "`dir` is a Windows command. To show all the hidden files in a folder with Windows command prompt, use `dir /a`."
    - content: "`pwd`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "`pwd` displays the path name of the current directory."
    - content: "`ls -a`"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "The `ls` command lists the names of files in the working directory. For a full list of flags that can be used with this command, use `ls --help`. The `ls-help` command will show you options like `-r` to reverse the list order or `-s` to show file sizes in blocks."

  - content: "The following tool is not a built-in tool used for quickly editing text in a file without leaving the WSL command line:"
    choices:
    - content: "Vim"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "For help with how to use the Vim text editor, see [Vim 101](https://www.linux.com/learn/vim-101-beginners-guide-vim). Do you remember how to exit Vim? Select Ctrl+C and then enter :q, or :wq if you want to save and quit."
    - content: "Nano"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "For help with how to use the Nano text editor, see [Nano docs](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Nano)."

  - content: "You can use Linux commands in PowerShell by using all of the following methods, except:"
    choices:
    - content: "Enter `wsl` before the command. For example, `wsl touch file_name.txt`."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "You might be using the PowerShell terminal, but entering `wsl` before a command invokes Linux. Wild!"
    - content: "Enter `linux` before the command. For example, `linux touch file_name.txt`."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Nope, this one doesn't work, but the other two options do!"
    - content: "Enter `wsl.exe` or `bash.exe`, and then enter your Linux command."

    - content: "You can copy a snippet of code in your internet browser and use Ctrl+V to paste it into your Ubuntu command line."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "This won't work. The Linux terminal doesn't support Ctrl+V, but you can right-click instead."

  - content: "The following is not a package manager used for installing software:"
    choices:
    - content: "npm"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Node Package Manager (npm) claims to be the world's largest software registry."
    - content: "Git"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Git isn't really a package manager. It's a distributed version control system used for tracking changes and collaboration."

      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "No. JSON and JS file types are different. JSON is a language-agnostic data-interchange format. JS is the JavaScript language format. For debugging with Visual Studio Code, you need to set the configuration with a JSON-formatted launch file."
    - content: "A `launch.json` file." 
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Visual Studio Code looks for a number of files when you open a directory. These files are used to customize the way Visual Studio Code behaves. The 'launch.json` file is one of the files used to customize starting the debugger."
