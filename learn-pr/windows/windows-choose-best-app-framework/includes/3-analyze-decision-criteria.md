Organizations must choose to balance the needs of their customers with the skills of their developers. In this unit, you learn how to analyze the decision criteria for a project to choose the best application framework for a Windows development project.

The consulting company has customers that want to build Windows applications. The company needs to choose the best application framework for each project. The company has a team of developers that are experienced in .NET, C#, and Extensible Application Markup Language (XAML). The company wants to use the skills of the existing development team to build the applications. Each project has unique requirements, so the company needs to choose the best application framework for each project.

- A line-of-business application that is deployed via a custom installer to enterprise customers in the healthcare industry.
- A log reader utility that is deployed via Windows Package Manager with WinGet scripting to enterprise customers.
- A file sync application that is deployed to the Microsoft Store for consumers.

In this unit, you learn the common factors that influence the decision of which application framework to use for a Windows development project:

- Appearance and style of the application
- Tablet usability (touch) and device compatibility
- Skillset of the team's enterprise developers
- Application performance and responsiveness
- Deployment scenarios and options

## Healthcare line-of-business application

The line-of-business application is an enterprise application that can be deployed to enterprise customers in the healthcare industry. It's targeting healthcare professionals, who use it to manage patient records. The application must be deployed via a custom installer to enterprise customers on desktop PCs running Windows 10 and Windows 11 in a hospital setting. These facilities can be slow to adopt the latest hardware and software. It's primarily used with a keyboard and mouse by healthcare professionals. Hospitals are typically a high-stress environment, so the app should be responsive and fast. The application should be easy to update with new features and bug fixes. It isn't important that the application supports the latest Fluent design system guidance. However, the client would like to match the theme of the application to each hospital's branding.

## Log reader utility

The log reader utility is a simple application that must be deployed via Windows Package Manager with WinGet scripting to enterprise customers. It's used by IT professionals to read log files retrieved from customers in the field. The application is deployed to enterprise customers on desktop PCs running Windows 10 and Windows 11. It's primarily used with a keyboard and mouse by IT professionals with varying levels of experience. The application should be easy to update with new features and bug fixes, but updates aren't expected to be frequent. The appearance of this application isn't the primary concern of the customer. The customer wants to focus on simplicity, ease of use, and performance. The timeline for this project is short, so the company wants to use the skills of the existing development team to build the application to maximize the team's productivity. This utility won't be ported to other platforms in the future.

## Cloud-based file sync application

The cloud-based file sync application is a consumer-facing application that is available in the Microsoft Store. It's used by consumers to back up and synchronize their local Windows files to a cloud service. The application must be available for the latest Windows devices, including desktops and tablet PCs. It should work well with pen and touch input. The application itself is free with optional in-app purchases for cloud storage subscriptions. It should be easy to update with new features and bug fixes. The client wants the application to support the latest Fluent design system guidance. Performance is an important consideration for the file sync app. The app should be responsive and fast. It must be able to view photos and play media files, using the rendering power of modern GPUs. The company wants to take advantage of the performance of the latest versions of .NET. The application should also be able to incorporate the latest Windows features, including the latest Windows APIs.

The leadership team wants to use the skills of their top development team to build the file sync app to maximize the team's productivity. The company may decide to port the app to other platforms in the future. So, the code should be easy to port to a framework that supports iOS, Android, and macOS.

Let's continue by discussing which framework is the best fit for each of our projects. In the next unit, we start with the healthcare line-of-business application.
