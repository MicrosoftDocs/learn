In this module, you learned about the different options for building Windows applications and how to choose the best option based on project requirements. The content introduces WPF, Windows Forms, and WinUI as frameworks for Windows development. It explains the features and benefits of each framework, including customization, rich functionality, high performance, and compatibility with touch devices. Each option has its own strengths and benefits, so it's important to consider your specific needs when choosing the best framework for your next Windows application.

The main takeaways from this module are:
