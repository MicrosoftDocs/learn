    title: Knowledge check
    questions:
    - content: What platform should you use to write Windows apps?
      choices:
      - content: UWP
        explanation: UWP is best if you want to write apps using Windows 10 features.
        isCorrect: false
      - content: WPF
        explanation: WPF is best if you're making a complex app that targets Windows OS versions that are earlier than Windows 10.
        isCorrect: false
      - content: Windows Forms
        explanation: Windows Forms is best if you're writing a simple tool or utility that doesn't require anything fancy.
        isCorrect: false
      - content: Whichever one you want!
        explanation: Each platform has their strengths and weaknesses. Choose the one that works best for you!
        isCorrect: true
    - content: What's the difference between writing a UWP app and writing a WPF app?
      choices:
      - content: WPF apps don't use XAML.
        explanation: False. Windows Forms apps don't use XAML, but both UWP and WPF do.
        isCorrect: false
      - content: Events are handled differently in the two types of apps.
        explanation: UWP and WPF don't necessarily affect how you handle events. They're platforms, not programming languages.
        isCorrect: false
      - content: UWP apps have access to their own runtime APIs and don't necessarily use .NET.
        explanation: Correct! The sample apps here are similar because they both use C# and XAML. But you might notice that the XAML controls are just a little bit different.
        isCorrect: true
    - content: What is Windows Template Studio (WTS) useful for?
      choices:
      - content: WTS creates a new UWP app that has the basic features and structure that you want.
        explanation: WTS handles all the generic work for implementing your app's structure, letting you focus on the functionality that makes it unique.
        isCorrect: true
      - content: WTS helps you set up the XAML for your UWP or WPF app.
        explanation: WTS doesn't just provide XAML code, and it works only for UWP apps.
        isCorrect: false
      - content: WTS makes it easy to add new features to your existing UWP app.
        explanation: WTS works only on new UWP apps or on apps that were created with WTS.
        isCorrect: false
