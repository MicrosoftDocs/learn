In this module, you have learned how to configure your app to support color and high contrast settings, and how to add the critical element of keyboard navigation.

Audio input and output is another crucial element of an inclusive app, one that we haven't covered in this module. If you've found this module interesting, we highly encourage you to check out our module on the inclusivity through voice input and the Narrator.

### Use the Accessibility Insights tool to examine your UI

There are some tools available that can assist in pointing out which UI elements have accessibility and keyboard support enabled and which are missing them. The use of these tools does not come close to replacing the need for user testing, but they can help in locating missing features.

1. Download the [Accessibility Insights](https://accessibilityinsights.io/) tool. Run it and skip the first screen by clicking **Continue**.

2. Run the tool along with the calculator. Select any calculator UI element and notice how its supported and unsupported features are listed in the tool.

3. Change to inspecting more UI element properties, rather than just the shortlist, by selecting the following element in the tool. Unfortunately, not all properties are picked up, such as the accelerator keys we've added, so the tool has its limitations.

Of course, there's always more to do with inclusivity. We haven't addressed hearing impairment, nor addressed some severe impairments such as mental illness. But hopefully, this module has given you a good start when it comes to adding accessibility to your app, and you're now encouraged to design with it in mind.

Keep in mind that your app is only genuinely inclusive if it has been tested and found usable by users with the impairments you are trying to address. No number of tools or good advice can compare with such valuable feedback. Hopefully, this module has given you some ideas, processes, and introductions to Windows tools that will assist you in making your apps genuinely inclusive.
