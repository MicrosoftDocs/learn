Azure Machine Learning provides the following features and capabilities:

| Feature | Capability |
|------------|-------------|
| Automated machine learning | This feature enables non-experts to quickly create an effective machine learning model from data.
| Azure Machine Learning designer | A graphical interface enabling no-code development of machine learning solutions. |
| Data and compute management | Cloud-based data storage and compute resources that professional data scientists can use to run data experiment code at scale. |
| Pipelines | Data scientists, software engineers, and IT operations professionals can define pipelines to orchestrate model training, deployment, and management tasks. |

Data scientists can use Azure Machine Learning throughout the entire machine learning lifecycle to:

- Ingest and prepare data.
- Run experiments to explore data and train predictive models.
- Deploy and manage trained models as web services.

Software engineers may interact with Azure Machine Learning in the following ways:

- Using Automated Machine Learning or Azure Machine Learning designer to train machine learning models and deploy them as services that can be integrated into AI-enabled applications.
- Collaborating with data scientists to deploy models based on common frameworks such as Scikit-Learn, PyTorch, and TensorFlow as web services, and consume them in applications.
- Using Azure Machine Learning SDKs or command-line interface (CLI) scripts to orchestrate DevOps processes that manage versioning, deployment, and testing of machine learning models as part of an overall application delivery solution.
