Generative AI is a relatively new and quickly progressing field of AI focused on AI models that *generate* content. Content that these models generate can be in the form of text, images, code or more, and in a way that almost feels like interacting with a real person in a real conversation. Generative AI models depend on *large language models* (LLMs) based on the transformer architecture that evolved from years of machine learning progress. Generative AI models are often queried with natural language prompts, and return an impressively accurate response when prompted correctly.

**Azure OpenAI Service** is an Azure AI service for deploying, utilizing, and fine-tuning models developed by OpenAI. OpenAI, the company who built ChatGPT, is one of the most popular applications most people have seen, and the models behind that ChatGPT uses are available through the Azure OpenAI Service. You can develop applications that use the powerful generative AI models in Azure OpenAI to further utilize this technology.

AI engineers can develop applications that use the powerful generative AI models in Azure OpenAI to further utilize this technology. Both REST and language specific SDKs are available when developing applications.
