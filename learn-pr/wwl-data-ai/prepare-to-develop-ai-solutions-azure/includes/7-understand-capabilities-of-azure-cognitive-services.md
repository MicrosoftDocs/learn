**Azure AI Services** are cloud-based services that encapsulate AI capabilities. Rather than a single product, you should think of Azure AI Services as a set of individual services that you can use as building blocks to compose sophisticated, intelligent applications.

Azure AI services offer a wide range of prebuilt AI capabilities across multiple categories, with examples shown in the following table.

| Natural language processing | Knowledge mining and document intelligence | Computer vision | Decision support | Generative AI |
