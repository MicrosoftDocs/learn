**Azure Cognitive Services** are cloud-based services that encapsulate AI capabilities. Rather than a single product, you should think of Azure Cognitive Services as a set of individual services that you can use as building blocks to compose sophisticated, intelligent applications.

Cognitive services offer a wide range of prebuilt AI capabilities across multiple categories, as shown in the following table.

| Language | Speech | Vision | Decision |
| -------- | ------ | ------ | -------- |
| Text analysis | Speech to Text | Image analysis |  Anomaly detection |
| Question answering | Text to Speech | Video analysis | Content moderation |
| Language understanding | Speech Translation | Image classification | Content personalization |
| Translation | Speaker Recognition | Object detection | |
| | | Facial analysis | |
| | | Optical character recognition | |
