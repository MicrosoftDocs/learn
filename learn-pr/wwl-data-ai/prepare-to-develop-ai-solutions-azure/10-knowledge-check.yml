  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "Which of the following best describes the predictions made by a machine learning model?"
    choices:
    - content: "Absolutely correct values based on conditional logic."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Machine learning models are trained using historic data, and rely on algorithms that find statistical relationships in the data. Predictions are generally based on probability; and while models are often extremely accurate, predictions are based on a confidence score that indicates a level of probability."
    - content: "Randomly selected values with an equal chance of selection."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Machine learning models are trained using historic data, and rely on algorithms that find statistical relationships in the data. Predictions are generally based on probability; and while models are often extremely accurate, predictions are based on a confidence score that indicates a level of probability."
    - content: "Probabilistic values based on correlations found in training data."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Machine learning models are trained using historic data, and rely on algorithms that find statistical relationships in the data. Predictions are generally based on probability; and while models are often extremely accurate, predictions are based on a confidence score that indicates a level of probability."
  - content: "A data scientist has used Azure Machine Learning to train a machine learning model. How can you use the model in your application?"
    choices:
    - content: "Use Azure Machine Learning to publish the model as a web service."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. You can use Azure Machine Learning to publish a trained model as a web service, and consume it from applications through its REST interface."
    - content: "Export the model as an Azure AI service."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. You can use Azure Machine Learning to publish a trained model as a web service, and consume it from applications through its REST interface."
    - content: "You must build your application using the Azure Machine Learning designer."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. You can use Azure Machine Learning to publish a trained model as a web service, and consume it from applications through its REST interface."
  - content: "You want to index a collection of text documents, and search them from a mobile application. Which service should you use to create the index?"
    choices:
    - content: "The Azure AI service"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Use Azure AI Search to index documents for search."
    - content: "Azure AI Search"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Use Azure AI Search to index documents for search."
    - content: "Azure OpenAI Service"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Use Azure AI Search to index documents for search."
