    - content: "Use an output parameter"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Output parameters don't pass values to stored procedures."
    - content: "Use an input parameter"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Input parameters are used as local variables within the body of the procedure."
  - content: "How do you access an output parameter from a stored procedure?"

      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The recordset doesn't contain the value in the output parameter."
    - content: "Declare a variable and pass it as an output parameter when you execute the stored procedure"

      explanation: "Correct. You need to create a variable that will be populated with the value in the output parameter when the procedure is run."
    - content: "Declare a variable inside the stored procedure and then view it after you run the stored procedure"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. You can't view values in variables inside the stored procedure."
  - content: "Where can you use a table-valued function?"
    choices:

      explanation: "Incorrect. Table-valued functions aren't limited to stored procedures."
    - content: "Anywhere in SQL that you can use a table"
      isCorrect: true
