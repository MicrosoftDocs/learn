  questions:
  - content: "What is the most important aspect of assessing databases for potential migration blockers before migrating to Azure SQL offerings?"
    choices:
    - content: "Determining the cost of migration."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The main focus of the assessment is on identifying compatibility issues, deprecated features, and behavior changes that may affect the migration process. While considering the cost is important, it isn't the primary focus of assessing databases."
    - content: "Identifying deprecated features and behavior changes."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Assessments help identify compatibility issues, breaking changes, and deprecated features that may impact a successful migration. It allows you to address these issues beforehand and plan for any necessary changes."
    - content: "Estimating the time required for migration."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The main focus of the assessment is on identifying compatibility issues, deprecated features, and behavior changes that may affect the migration process. While estimating the time required for migration is important, it isn't the primary focus of assessing databases."
  - content: "What are the options for running SQL Server migration assessments at scale?"
    choices:
    - content: "PowerShell and Azure CLI."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Migration assessments can be run at scale using PowerShell or Azure CLI. These command-line interfaces allow for automation and performing these tasks on multiple databases or instances."
    - content: "SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) only."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While SSMS is a valuable tool for database management, it doesn't provide the automation capabilities needed for at-scale migration assessments across multiple instances."
    - content: "Azure portal and Azure Storage Explorer."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While Azure portal can be used for assessments through Azure Migrate and Azure Database Migration Service, Azure Storage Explorer isn't a relevant tool for migration assessments."
  - content: "What factors are considered when calculating the estimated monthly cost for Azure SQL Database using the Azure SQL Assessment tool?"
    choices:
    - content: "Database size, compute size, and storage size."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. While database size and compute size are part of the calculation, storage size isn't part of it."
    - content: "Database size, compute size, and database activity."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. When calculating the estimated monthly cost for Azure SQL Database using the Azure SQL Assessment tool, the factors considered are the database size, compute size, and database activity."
    - content: "Compute size, storage size, and database activity."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. While compute size and database activity are part of the calculation, storage size isn't part of it."
