In this module, you learned about several assessment tools available for migrating SQL Server databases to Azure. These tools include SQL Server enabled by Azure Arc, Azure Migrate, and Azure Database Migration Service.

SQL Server enabled by Azure Arc provides an integrated assessment experience directly in the Azure portal, automatically generating migration readiness evaluations once your SQL Server instances are connected. Azure Migrate offers a comprehensive solution for assessing and migrating on-premises databases at scale, providing discovery, assessment, and migration planning capabilities. Azure Database Migration Service delivers assessment and migration functionality through the Azure portal, PowerShell, and Azure CLI.
