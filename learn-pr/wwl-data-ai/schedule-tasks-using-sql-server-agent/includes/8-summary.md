The SQL Server Agent provides a robust mechanism for managing and maintaining your SQL Server and Azure SQL managed instance deployments. In addition to providing job scheduling, it provides alerting and some monitoring for your databases. Maintenance plans can be used to provide backups, index and statistics maintenance, and log management activity. Note that the SQL Server Agent is only available on SQL Server and Azure SQL Managed Instance, but not Azure SQL Database. Finally, the most important thing you can do as a DBA is ensure that your databases are backed up, and that you test your database backups regularly by making sure they can be successfully restored.

The extended events engine in Azure SQL is an extremely powerful monitoring system that allows you to capture granular information about activity in your databases and servers. The monitoring solutions on the Azure platform allow you to easily configure powerful monitoring for your environment and provide automated responses to error conditions.

Now that you've reviewed this module, you should be able to:

- Describe what maintenance activities you should perform on your databases
- Describe how to configure notifications and alerts on SQL Server Agent jobs and SQL Server
- Describe how to configure notifications alerts based on performance monitor values
- Monitor for server/database configuration changes with extended events
- Use extended events for performance analysis
