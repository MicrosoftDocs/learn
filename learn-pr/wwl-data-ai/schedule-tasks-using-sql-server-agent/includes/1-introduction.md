Database systems require regular maintenance, including tasks like backups and updating statistics. Maintenance may also involve scheduled jobs that run against a database. Common examples include extracting, transforming, and loading data from a transaction processing system into a data warehouse. In SQL Server and Azure SQL Managed Instance, the SQL Server Agent service allows you to schedule these maintenance tasks.

Azure offers built-in resource monitoring, and you can also use the platform's options for handling and responding to events, enhancing your ability to maintain and manage your database systems effectively.

Most SQL Server Agent features are supported in Azure SQL Managed Instance, but there are some minor T-SQL differences between SQL Server and Azure SQL Managed Instance that might affect job scripts.

## Learning objectives

At the end of this module, you'll understand:

- What maintenance activities you should perform on your databases
- How to configure notifications and alerts on SQL Server Agent jobs and SQL Server
- How to configure notifications alerts based on performance monitor values
