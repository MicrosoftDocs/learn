Fine-tuning **Large Language Models** (**LLMs**) involves adapting pretrained models, such as GPT-4, to perform specific tasks or operate within particular domains by training them on smaller, task-specific datasets.

You can use fine-tuning to tap into the general knowledge and language capabilities of LLMs while improving their performance for specialized tasks like customer support, technical documentation, or domain-specific question answering.

By using fine-tuning, you create models that are more accurate and relevant to your specific use case, while saving computational resources and time compared to training from scratch.
