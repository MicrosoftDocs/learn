Fine-tuning adapts pretrained Large Language Models to perform specific tasks by continuing training with specialized datasets, making models more accurate for particular use cases without requiring full model training from initial parameters.

In this module, you learned the concepts of fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) and how to approach fine-tuning within Azure Databricks. You explored when fine-tuning is the right approach and how it adapts pretrained models for specific tasks or domains. You also learned about data preparation requirements, environment configuration, and the process of implementing fine-tuning projects.
