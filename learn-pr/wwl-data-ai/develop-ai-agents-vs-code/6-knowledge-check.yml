  questions:
  - content: "When you create a new agent in the Azure AI Foundry extension, what two views are automatically opened?"
    choices:
    - content: "The YAML file and the Playground view"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The Playground is used for testing agents after they're configured, not during initial creation."
    - content: "The YAML file and the Designer view"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. When you create an agent, the extension opens both the agent YAML file and the Designer view, providing both a visual interface and direct access to the configuration file."
    - content: "The Designer view and the Code Generation view"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Code generation is available after deployment, not during initial agent creation."
  - content: "What is a key benefit of using Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers for agent tools?"
    choices:
    - content: "They only work with Microsoft-built tools"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. MCP is an open protocol that supports community-driven tools and third-party implementations."
    - content: "They provide reusable components that work across different agents"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. MCP servers provide standardized interfaces that create reusable components, enabling tools to work across different agent implementations and leverage community-driven solutions."
    - content: "They replace the need for all built-in tools"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. MCP servers complement built-in tools rather than replacing them, providing additional standardized tool options."
  - content: "How does the Azure AI Foundry Agent Service manage conversation sessions when users interact with deployed agents?"
    choices:
    - content: "The system creates individual threads for each conversation to manage context and message history"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. When users interact with deployed agents, the system creates threads (conversation sessions) that store messages and maintain context throughout the conversation, with individual messages and runs managed within those threads."
    - content: "Each message is processed independently with no conversation history"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The system maintains conversation context through threads that store message history and context."
    - content: "All user conversations are combined into one shared global session"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Each conversation gets its own separate thread to maintain individual context and message history."
