summary: Learn how to configure automatic horizontal scaling for containerized applications in Azure Container Apps. Configure HTTP, TCP, CPU, and memory scale rules, implement event-driven scaling with KEDA, optimize compute resources, and apply revision modes for traffic management.
abstract: |
  After completing this module, you'll be able to:
    - Configure HTTP, TCP, CPU, and memory scale rules for container apps
    - Implement event-driven scaling using KEDA scalers for Azure services
    - Select appropriate compute resources to optimize performance and cost
    - Apply revision modes to control scaling behavior and traffic distribution
prerequisites: |
  Before beginning this module, you should have:
  - Programming experience with languages such as Python, JavaScript, or C#.
  - Basic understanding of Azure services and cloud computing concepts.
  - Familiarity with containerization concepts and Docker.
  - Experience deploying applications to Azure Container Apps or similar container platforms.
