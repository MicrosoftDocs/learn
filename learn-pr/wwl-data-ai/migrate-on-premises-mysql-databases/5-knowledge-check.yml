    choices:
    - content: "Set an alert for bug fix updates and create a runbook to apply the updates automatically."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Bug fix updates are automatically applied. No action needs to be taken."
    - content: "Bug fix updates are automatically applied. No action needs to be taken."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Bug fix updates are automatically applied. No action needs to be taken."
    - content: "Use the Advanced Threat Protection feature to ensure bug fixes are applied."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Bug fix updates are automatically applied. No action needs to be taken."
  - content: "You want to keep your writeable on-premises version of a MySQL database, but create replica read-only copies for users in another country. What's the most straightforward method to achieve this with Azure Database for MySQL?"
    choices:
    - content: "Create an Azure Database for MySQL instance in the region closest to your users and configure Data-In Replication."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Data-in Replication uses the native replication functionality of MySQL to replicate data from an external MySQL Server into Azure Database for MySQL."
    - content: "Create a read replica copy of your database located in the region closest to your users."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Data-in Replication uses the native replication functionality of MySQL to replicate data from an external MySQL Server into Azure Database for MySQL."
    - content: "Create a writeable Azure Database for MySQL instance in the region closest to your users, and create a read-only replica in your on-premises MySQL server."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Data-in Replication uses the native replication functionality of MySQL to replicate data from an external MySQL Server into Azure Database for MySQL."
  - content: "In MySQL, you have a database that includes large tables of data for employees and customers. In Azure Database for MySQL, you only want customer data. What's the easiest way to migrate the required data to Azure Database for MySQL?"
    choices:
    - content: "Delete the unnecessary tables before performing a dump and restore."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "All of the options would work, but MySQL Workbench allows you to select which objects to export in a straightforward manner."
    - content: "Perform a mysqldump, and then edit the sql file to omit the tables that aren't required."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "All of the options would work, but MySQL Workbench allows you to select which objects to export in a straightforward manner."
    - content: "Perform a **Data Export** from MySQL Workbench, and select the required objects."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "All of the options would work, but MySQL Workbench allows you to select which objects to export in a straightforward manner."
  - content: "You're performing an online migration on a live MySQL database. What happens to transactions that occur during the migration?"
    choices:
    - content: "They're applied to the source database and need to be captured so they can be applied to the destination database after migration."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The Azure Database Migration Service copies all of your existing data to Azure, and then continuously performs a synchronization operation from the source database. Any new transactions performed against the on-premises system will be copied to the new database in Azure."
    - content: "They're applied to the source database and synchronized to the destination database."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "The Azure Database Migration Service copies all of your existing data to Azure, and then continuously performs a synchronization operation from the source database. Any new transactions performed against the on-premises system will be copied to the new database in Azure."
    - content: "They're blocked and client applications will receive an error. The database should be taken offline before migration."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The Azure Database Migration Service copies all of your existing data to Azure, and then continuously performs a synchronization operation from the source database. Any new transactions performed against the on-premises system will be copied to the new database in Azure."
  - content: "You have many user accounts in MySQL. How are these accounts migrated to Azure Database for MySQL?"
    choices:
    - content: "The accounts are automatically migrated by the Azure Database Migration Service."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Azure Database for MySQL uses the same authentication and authorization mechanisms as MySQL running on-premises. When you transfer a MySQL database to Azure Database for MySQL using the Azure Database Migration Service, users aren't copied. You must manually recreate the necessary user accounts."
    - content: "The accounts are automatically migrated by a dump and restore migration."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Azure Database for MySQL uses the same authentication and authorization mechanisms as MySQL running on-premises. When you transfer a MySQL database to Azure Database for MySQL using the Azure Database Migration Service, users aren't copied. You must manually recreate the necessary user accounts."
    - content: "You must manually create the accounts post-migration."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Azure Database for MySQL uses the same authentication and authorization mechanisms as MySQL running on-premises. When you transfer a MySQL database to Azure Database for MySQL using the Azure Database Migration Service, users aren't copied. You must manually recreate the necessary user accounts."
  - content: "You have many applications, using a variety of programming languages, that must be redirected to your migrated database. Where do you find the connection settings for your client application?"
    choices:
    - content: "In the INFORMATION_SCHEMA.CONNECTION_STRINGS table in Azure Database for MySQL."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "You'll find the connection information for your Azure Database for MySQL service in the Azure portal, on the **Connection strings** page for your Azure Database for MySQL service."
    - content: "In the **Connection strings** page for Azure Database for MySQL."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "You'll find the connection information for your Azure Database for MySQL service in the Azure portal, on the **Connection strings** page for your Azure Database for MySQL service."
    - content: "In the **Connection settings** page for your Azure portal."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "You'll find the connection information for your Azure Database for MySQL service in the Azure portal, on the **Connection strings** page for your Azure Database for MySQL service."
