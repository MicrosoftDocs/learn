  - content: An enterprise data analyst is tasked with creating a report based on a published semantic model. What should the analyst do to complete this task?
    choices:
    - content: The analyst should copy the existing semantic model and make changes to it.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. Copying and modifying the existing semantic model could lead to data integrity issues.
    - content: The analyst should connect to the existing Power BI semantic model from Power BI Desktop.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. Connecting to the existing semantic model allows for reuse and ensures data integrity.
    - content: The analyst should recreate the semantic model from scratch for the new report.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. Recreating the semantic model from scratch is unnecessary and time-consuming if a suitable model already exists.
  - content: A report developer in an organization is trying to connect to curated semantic models but is unsure which ones to use. They come across a model with a 'Promoted' badge. What does this imply?
    choices:
    - content: The model has been reviewed and certified by an organization-authorized reviewer as meeting the organization's quality standards.
      isCorrect: false

    - content: The creators of the model believe it's ready for sharing and reuse within the organization.
