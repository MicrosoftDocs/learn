While you can use a question answering knowledge store in any sort of application, they are commonly used to support bots.

A *bot* is a conversational application that enables users to interact using natural language through one or more *channels*, such as email, web chat, voice messaging, or social media platform such as Microsoft Teams.

Question answering is often the starting point for bot development - particularly for conversational dialogs that involve answering user questions. For this reason, Language Studio provides the option to easily create a bot that runs in the Azure Bot Service based on your knowledge base.

To create a bot from your knowledge base, use Language Studio to deploy the bot and then use the **Create Bot** button to create a bot in your Azure subscription. You can then edit and customize your bot in the Azure portal.
