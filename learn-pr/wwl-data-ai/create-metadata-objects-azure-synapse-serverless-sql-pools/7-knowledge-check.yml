  questions:
  - content: "Which if the following statements is true of a lake database?"
    choices:
    - content: "Data is stored in a relational database store and cannot be directly accessed in the data lake files."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. File storage is decoupled from the relational database schema and query processing."
    - content: "Data is stored in files that cannot be queried using SQL."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. You can use SQL to query data in a lake database."
    - content: "A relational schema is overlaid on the underlying files, and can be queried using a serverless SQL pool or a Spark pool."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. A lake database abstracts files with a relational schema that can be queried using SQL in a serverless SQL pool or a Spark pool."
  - content: "You need to create a new lake database for a retail solution. What's the most efficient way to do this?"
    choices:
    - content: "Create a sample database in Azure SQL Database and export the SQL scripts to create the schema for the lake database."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A sample Azure SQL database may not meet your needs, and the scripts would not be suitable for a lake database."
    - content: "Start with the Retail database template in Azure Synapse Studio, and adapt it as necessary."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The Gallery in Azure Synapse Studio includes industry-proven database schema templates, including one for retail."
    - content: "Start with an empty database and create a normalized schema."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While this approach would work, it's generally more efficient to start from a template."
  - content: "You have Parquet files in an existing data lake folder for which you want to create a table in a lake database. What should you do?"
    choices:
    - content: "Use a CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE AS SELECT (CETAS) query to create the table."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A CETAS statement will move the data and create a table based on the new location."
    - content: "Convert the files in the folder to CSV format."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. You can create lake database tables from Parquet files."
    - content: "Use the database designer to create a table based on the existing folder."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. You can add a table to a database from existing files."
