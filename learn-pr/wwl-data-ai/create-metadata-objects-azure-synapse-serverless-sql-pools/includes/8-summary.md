Using familiar T-SQL concepts like databases, external tables, and views you can easily create a virtual SQL layer over the data in the lake. This will enable any client that can connect to serverless SQL pool to interact with data residing in the data lake, without a need to move or ingest the data.  

Now that you have completed this module, you have learned how to:

- Create databases in Azure Synapse serverless SQL pools

- Create external data sources in Azure Synapse serverless SQL pools
- Create external tables in Azure Synapse serverless SQL pools
- Create views in Azure Synapse serverless SQL pools
