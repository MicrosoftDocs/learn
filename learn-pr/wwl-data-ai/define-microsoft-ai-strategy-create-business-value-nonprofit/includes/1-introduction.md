The nonprofit industry faces many challenges. In world where AI is revolutionizing every job and sector, decision makers must realize that AI plays an important role in finding solutions. This module covers the most common nonprofit scenarios for AI.

Finding the right tools and partnerships to implement these AI use cases can be challenging. To assist with this, this module provides insights into which Microsoft AI products and services can support each use case. Microsoft AI offers state-of-the-art models, including the latest generative AI, and is designed for use by workers of all skill levels. AI can boost productivity embedded in everyday apps or in more complex AI systems. You can learn more about Microsoft AI products and services in the [Leverage AI tools and resources for your business](/training/modules/leverage-ai-tools/) module.

It’s not enough to just use AI for nonprofit projects. AI practices and solutions must comply with the ethical standards of responsible AI. These requirements include fairness, reliability, privacy, security, inclusivity, transparency, and accountability. These standards are maintained during the development and maintenance of all Microsoft AI products and services.
