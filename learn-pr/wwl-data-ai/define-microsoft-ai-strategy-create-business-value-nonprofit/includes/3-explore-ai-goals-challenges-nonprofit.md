When you adopt AI in a nonprofit project, what can you expect? What potential obstacles must you watch for?

## Goals

The main goal for AI projects in the Nonprofit industry is to use AI technology to **enhance the impact and efficiency of nonprofit organizations**. This includes optimizing grant writing and fundraising efforts, improving donor engagement, and using data-driven decision-making to better serve their missions.

When nonprofit organizations implement AI solutions, they are often trying to address challenges achieving these goals:
 - Program management
 - Volunteer management
 - Fundraising
 - Grant management
 - Donor relations
 - People development

## Challenges

Nonprofits play a big role in the global workforce, employing 7.4% of workers worldwide. Among international nonprofit staff, 70% are full-time paid employees, while about 29% are dedicated volunteers. According to the United Nation’s 2018 World Volunteerism Report, over 1 billion volunteers contribute their time and skills globally, equivalent to a workforce of 109 million full-time workers.

In the United States alone, there are over 1.5 million nonprofits, making up 10% of the US workforce and ranking as the third-largest industry after retail and manufacturing. These organizations contribute 5.7% to the overall GDP. However, nearly two-thirds of these nonprofits have annual revenues below $50,000.

According to the [2024 State of the Nonprofit Sector Report](https://www.forvismazars.us/forsights/2024/02/2024-state-of-the-nonprofit-sector-report), the top 5 challenges nonprofits face are:
 - Rising operating costs
 - Lack of adequate finances/resources
 - Limited staff capacity
 - Difficulty recruiting and retaining quality staff
 - Economic downturn/inflation
