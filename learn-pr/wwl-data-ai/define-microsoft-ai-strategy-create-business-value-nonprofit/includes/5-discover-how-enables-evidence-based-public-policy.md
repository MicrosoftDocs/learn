## The challenge

By 2030, RTI aims to improve the well-being of one billion people worldwide through its science-based solutions. With such an ambitious goal, every bit of gained productivity matters. To become more efficient and to support their staff members’ creativity, RTI decided to experiment with Microsoft 365 Copilot, the AI-powered assistant.

“Ultimately, what we have to offer is our energy and our time,” says Amanda Greenway, Manager of Collaboration Technologies at RTI. “As much as we can route away from tasks like finding the perfect wording for emails and reading chats, the more we can focus on finding solutions for our clients.”

## The solution

RTI International implemented Microsoft 365 Copilot to enhance productivity and support staff creativity. By using Copilot, staff can quickly search for details across Teams, Outlook, and recorded meetings, minimizing the time spent toggling between applications. Copilot also helps staff catch up on missed communications and adjust the tone of emails and documents, which is particularly beneficial for neurodiverse individuals. Additionally, Copilot summarizes extensive research documents, providing vital digests for clients and the public. RTI's data governance policies ensure that Copilot only surfaces documents staff have permission to view, keeping organizational data secure.

## The results

Ultimately, support from AI helps RTI staff do more of what moves the needle on global issues. “Copilot gives us more time to stay in a flow state while at work,” Greenway says. Fewer interruptions and greater efficiencies, coupled with RTI staff members’ passion and dedication, help the nonprofit ask the big questions and carry out their mission.
