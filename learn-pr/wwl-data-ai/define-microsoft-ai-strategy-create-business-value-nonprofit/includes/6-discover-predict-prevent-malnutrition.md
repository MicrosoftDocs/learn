Learn how a multi-stakeholder effort is developing Azure AI-powered tool to predict malnutrition across Kenya using Azure AI.


The solution will provide location-specific forecasts to inform the nonprofit, partnering organizations, and governmental bodies.

Amref anticipates that the tool will enable them to better understand current nutrition circumstances and predict future problems to plan and pre-position resources. Ultimately, they believe they will be able to act earlier to save more lives.

Amref Health Africa, a global nonprofit, is using Microsoft technologies to combat malnutrition in Kenya. With Azure AI, Amref has created a tool that predicts malnutrition hotspots, providing location-specific forecasts. This helps Amref and partners like the Kenyan Ministry of Health and the University of Southern California plan interventions, mobilize resources, and prevent malnutrition more effectively. The AI model, trained on diverse data including anonymized health information and satellite imagery, offers precise predictions at one-, three-, and six-month intervals, anticipating seasonal influences like floods and droughts.

Supported by the Microsoft AI for Good Lab, the malnutrition forecasting model turns extensive health data into actionable insights. This enables healthcare providers, such as Martin Nyawami at the Moyenyi Dispensary in Kinango, to better plan and allocate resources, ultimately saving lives. By integrating AI-driven predictions, Amref aims to proactively address malnutrition, ensuring children, babies, and pregnant mothers receive necessary care. This technology enhances Amref's ability to prevent malnutrition and supports Kenya's goal of ending malnutrition nationwide by 2027.
