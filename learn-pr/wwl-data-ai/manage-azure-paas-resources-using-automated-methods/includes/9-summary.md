In this module you learned about various ways to automate common tasks in Azure and within SQL Server. One of the benefits of cloud computing is that a framework for robust automation, monitoring, and tooling is part of the platform. 

In the on-premises world, a complex set of tools would need to be assembled just to match the built-in functionality available with Azure metrics, policy, and automation. Additionally, SQL Server provides an automation framework using SQL Agent, and a robust monitoring solution via Extended Events. You can take advantage of both Azure Automation and Azure elastic jobs to automate the management of your Azure resources.
