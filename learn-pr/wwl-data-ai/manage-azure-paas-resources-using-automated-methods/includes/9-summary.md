In this module you learned about various ways to automate common tasks in Azure and within SQL Server. One of the benefits of cloud computing is that a framework for robust automation, monitoring, and tooling is part of the platform. In the on-premises world, a complex set of tools would need to be assembled just to match the built-in functionality available with Azure metrics, policy, and automation. Additionally, SQL Server provides an automation framework using SQL Agent, and a very robust monitoring solution via Extended Events. You can take advantage of both Azure automation and Azure elastic jobs to automate the management of your Azure resources.

Now that you've reviewed this module, you should be able to:

- Discuss the benefits of Azure policy
- Describe the capabilities of Azure automation
- Understand how to use elastic Jobs
