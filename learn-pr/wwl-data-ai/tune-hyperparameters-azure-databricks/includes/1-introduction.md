Hyperparameters are parameters defined before model training that can influence the model's performance. There are different hyperparameters available to fine-tune depending on the algorithm used to train a model, which can be done through a process called **hyperparameter tuning**.

In this module, you'll learn how to use Azure Databricks with MLflow to do hyperparameter tuning and model selection.

## Learning objectives

After completing this module, you’ll be able to:

- Understand hyperparameter tuning and its role in machine learning.
- Learn how to use the two open-source tools - automated MLflow and Hyperopt - to automate the process of model selection and hyperparameter tuning.
