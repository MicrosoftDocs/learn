quiz:
  questions:
  - content: "A Python script to train a model is created in Azure Databricks and attached to a cluster with the Databricks Runtime for Machine Learning. To run the code and enable automated MLflow when tuning hyperparameters, which method should be used?"
    choices:
    - content: "`ParamGridBuilder()`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. `ParamGridBuilder()` is used to define the search space."
    - content: "`CrossValidator`"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. `CrossValidator` or `TrainValidationSplit` can be used to tune hyperparameters with automated MLflow."
    - content: "`RegressionEvaluator()`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. `RegressionEvaluator()` can be used with regression models to evaluate the models that are trained."
  - content: "Which arguments are needed to run the Hyperopt function `fmin()`?"
    choices:
    - content: "The evaluation metric, the model, and the data."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Although you need these things, they are not direct arguments for the `fmin()` function."
    - content: "The objective function, the search space, and the model."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The model is not an argument for the `fmin()` function."
    - content: "The objective function, the search space, and the search algorithm."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The objective function `fn`, the search space `space`, and the search algorithm `algo` are arguments for the `fmin()` function."
