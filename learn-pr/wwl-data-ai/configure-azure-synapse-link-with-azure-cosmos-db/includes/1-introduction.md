By using this HTAP solution, organizations can make operational data in Azure Cosmos DB available for analysis and reporting in Azure Synapse Analytics in near-real time without the need to develop a complex ETL pipeline.

In this module, you'll learn how to:

- Configure a Cosmos DB Account to use Azure Synapse Link.
- Create an analytical store enabled container.
- Create a linked service for Cosmos DB.
