  questions:
  - content: "Every minute, a JSON object is extracted from an Internet of Things (IoT) device. What is the type of data that is extracted?"
    choices:
    - content: "Structured"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A JSON object consists of key-value pairs that may vary per data point. Structured data adheres to a fixed schema."
    - content: "Semi-structured"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. A JSON object is considered semi-structured."
    - content: "Unstructured"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A JSON object has key-value pairs that can be queried, so it shouldn't be stored as unstructured data."
  - content: "When a data scientist extracts JSON objects from an IoT device, and combines all transformed data in a CSV file, which data store would be best to use?"
    choices:
    - content: "Azure Blob Storage"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Though you can store a CSV in an Azure Blob Storage, an IoT device generates many data points and you may reach the storage limits quickly."
    - content: "Azure Data Lake Storage"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. You can store CSV files in a data lake without having any capacity constraints."
    - content: "Azure SQL Database"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A CSV file can't be directly stored in an Azure SQL Database, you'd have to convert the file to a SQL table to store the data."
