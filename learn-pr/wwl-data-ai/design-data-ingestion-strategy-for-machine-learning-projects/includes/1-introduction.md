Data is the foundation of machine learning. Both data quantity and data quality will affect the model’s accuracy.

To train a machine learning model, you need access to the data you plan to use. So, before you start to experiment with machine learning models, make sure to identify the data sources and know which tools you want to use to load and transform the data. 

In this module, you'll learn how to design a data ingestion strategy for machine learning projects. 

## Learning objectives

In this module, you'll learn how to:

- Identify your data source and format.
- Choose how to serve data to machine learning workflows.
- Design a data ingestion solution.
