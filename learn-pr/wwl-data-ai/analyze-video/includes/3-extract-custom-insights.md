Azure Video Indexer includes predefined models that can recognize well-known celebrities, do OCR, and transcribe spoken phrases into text. You can extend the recognition capabilities of Video Analyzer by creating custom models for:

- **People**. Add images of the faces of people you want to recognize in videos, and train a model. Video Indexer will then recognize these people in all of your videos.

- **Language**. If your organization uses specific terminology that may not be in common usage, you can train a custom model to detect and transcribe it.
- **Brands**. You can train a model to recognize specific names as brands, for example to identify products, projects, or companies that are relevant to your business.
