Migrating to Azure SQL allows you to modernize your data estate by taking advantage of its PaaS capabilities. Opting for Azure SQL Database, for example, allows you to eliminate dependencies on technical components that are specific to the instance level, such as SQL Agent jobs.

As part of the migration process, transitioning to Azure SQL may require individuals, whether they are developers or experienced database administrators, to adapt to a different way of managing and deploying their applications and databases. Therefore, understanding the core capabilities of the PaaS platform is crucial to help ease this initial sense of challenge and ensure that applications continue to operate effectively and securely in Azure post-migration.

### Use case scenario

Throughout this module, we're using a practical scenario to explain key post-migration concepts.

Suppose you work for a company that builds bikes and bicycle parts. You have several legacy database servers that you want to upgrade, including and product database, a parts stock database, and a human resources database. You also want to move from a capital expenditure model to an operational expenditure model, and benefit from the scalability and availability of Azure services. 

You have already migrated a few of your SQL Server databases to Azure SQL Database and Azure SQL Managed Instance. Now you need to take into account the specific post-migration activities required for security, auditing, business continuity, and performance monitoring.

You'll expand your knowledge beyond migration to focus on essential post-migration activities. You'll learn how to strengthen the security of your Azure SQL resources after migration, ensuring data protection and compliance. You'll then explore techniques to establish business continuity plans, safeguarding your data against unexpected disruptions. Finally, you'll learn performance monitoring tools and practices to optimize your Azure SQL environment for efficiency and reliability.
