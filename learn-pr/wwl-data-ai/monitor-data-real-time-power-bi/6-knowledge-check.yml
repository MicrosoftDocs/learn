  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "Gladys is a developer at Adventure Works who needs to create a real-time Power BI solution to monitor their call center. When there are excessive numbers of callers waiting on hold, Power BI should notify the call center manager. What type of Power BI artifact should Gladys develop?"
    choices:
    - content: "Dashboard."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The call center manage can create an alert based on a dashboard tile."
    - content: "Power BI report."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Power BI reports don’t support alerting."
    - content: "Streaming dataflow."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Streaming datasets don’t support alerting."
  - content: "Benny is a report author at Adventure Works who needs to set up a Power BI report page to show real-time manufacturing data with latency of 5 minutes. The report connects to a dataset that represents a DirectQuery model. Because the DirectQuery source is an operational system, it should be queried only when necessary. What should Benny do?"
    choices:
    - content: "Set the `AutoRefresh` property to a value greater than zero."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Power BI reports don’t have an `AutoRefresh` property. It's a property of a paginated report."
    - content: "Enable automatic page fresh with a change detection measure."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Automatic page refresh is the appropriate setting, and using a change detection measure will reduce the burden placed on the DirectQuery data source."
    - content: "Set up incremental refresh for the dataset and enable the DirectQuery partition."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Incremental refresh isn’t possible for a DirectQuery table."
  - content: "Fiafia is a developer at Adventure Works who needs to deliver a real-time Power BI dashboard. It should present real-time manufacturing data with the lowest possible latency. The dashboard only shows manufacturing events for the past hour. The solution should use the minimum of Power BI resources. What type of dataset should Fiafia develop?"
    choices:
    - content: "DirectQuery dataset."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A DirectQuery dataset would result in a latency of 15 minutes at best."
    - content: "Push dataset."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A push dataset would result in a latency of 3-5 seconds, but a push dataset could achieve lower latency"
    - content: "Streaming dataset."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. A streaming dataset would result in the lowest latency of about one second."
