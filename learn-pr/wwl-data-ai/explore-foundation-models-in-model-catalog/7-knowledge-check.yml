quiz:
  questions:
  - content: "Which of the following techniques is used to determine the importance of words in a document within the context of a larger collection of documents?"
    choices:
    - content: "Naïve Bayes"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Naïve Bayes calculates the probability of a document belonging to a particular class based on the probabilities of individual words given that class."
    - content: "TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. TF-IDF is a technique used to determine the importance of words in a document within the context of a larger collection of documents."
    - content: " Word2Vec"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Word2Vec is a technique for generating word embeddings, which are dense vector representations of words that capture semantic relationships between words. "
  - content: "What type of neural network architecture is widely used for natural language processing tasks and has been instrumental in achieving state-of-the-art results in various language-related tasks?"
    choices:
    - content: "Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While RNNs have been historically used for sequence data like text, they suffer from issues like vanishing gradients and struggle to capture long-range dependencies in text. However, Transformers have shown to be more efficient at processing large amounts of text compared to RNNs."
    - content: "Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. LSTMs are a type of recurrent neural network designed to handle sequences by effectively capturing long-range dependencies. However, Transformers have shown to be more efficient at processing large amounts of text compared to RNNs."
    - content: "Transformer"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Transformers are a neural network architecture specifically designed for processing sequential data, like text. The introduction of positional encoding together with attention, instead of using recurrence, has resulted in a massive advancement in NLP."
  - content: "Which of the following foundation models, available through the model catalog in Azure Machine Learning, is likely most suitable for text classification?"
    choices:
    - content: "BERT"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. BERT is commonly used for text classification and question answering."
    - content: "GPT"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. GPT is commonly used for tasks like text generation and chat completions."
    - content: "LLaMA"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. LLaMA is commonly used for tasks like text generation and chat completions."
