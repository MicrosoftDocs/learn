  questions:
  - content: "What does RAG with Azure OpenAI enable developers to do?"
    choices:
    - content: "Create their own AI chat models"

    - content: "Access Azure OpenAI without an approved subscription"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Access to Azure OpenAI requires an approved subscription."
    - content: "Use supported AI chat models that can reference specific sources of data"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Azure OpenAI on your data allows developers to use supported AI chat models that can reference specific sources of data to ground the response."
  - content: "What is the recommended way to add data when using Azure OpenAI on your data?"
    choices:
    - content: "Using any data source option available for Azure OpenAI on your data."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Using any data source option may not yield the best results."
    - content: "Using Azure AI Studio to create the search resource and index."
      isCorrect: true

      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Connecting to files without using Azure AI Studio may not yield the best results."
  - content: "What are some recommended prompt engineering techniques when using RAG with Azure OpenAI on your own data?"
    choices:
    - content: "Break down the task and use chain of thought prompting."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Breaking down the task and using chain of thought prompting can help the model respond more effectively within the token limit."
    - content: "Include as much conversation history as possible in your call."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Including too much conversation history can exceed the token limit and impact the model's response."
    - content: "Use a single long prompt to provide all necessary information."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Using a single long prompt can also exceed the token limit and impact the model's response."
