  questions:
  - content: "How many Azure Machine Learning workspaces should the team create?"
    choices:
    - content: "One"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. With such a small team, one workspace is enough."
    - content: "Two"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Though in larger projects we'd like at least two workspaces to represent a development and production environment, the current team is too small. Having more than one workspace only creates unnecessary overhead."
    - content: "Three"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Though in larger projects we'd like at least two workspaces to represent a development and production environment, the current team is too small. Having more than one workspace only creates unnecessary overhead."
  - content: "When should we retrain the model?"
    choices:
    - content: "Every week."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. There doesn't seem to be a reason to retrain the model every week, especially as we don't know whether we have new data that we should use each week."
    - content: "When the model's metrics are below the benchmark."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The most important thing is that the model performs as expected. When the model's performance is in jeopardy, we should retrain the model."
    - content: "When there's data drift."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. It's stated that new data is not seen as trustworthy. Currently, we shouldn't rely on monitoring the data to decide when to retrain the model."
