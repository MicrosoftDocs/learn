  questions:
  - content: "What happens to nested transactions when the outer transaction is rolled back?"
    choices:
    - content: "The inner transaction is executed."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. If the outer transaction is rolled back, the inner transaction will not be executed."
    - content: "The inner transaction prevents the outer transaction from being rolled back. Both the inner and outer transaction will be executed."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. If the outer transaction is rolled back, the inner transaction will not be executed. The inner transaction will not prevent the outer transaction from being rolled back."
    - content: "The inner transaction is also rolled back."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. All inner transactions are rolled back when the outer transaction is rolled back."
  - content: "Which of the following T-SQL keywords are used to control transactions?"
    choices:
    - content: "BEGIN TRANSACTION"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. BEGIN TRANSACTION keywords are used to start an explicit transaction."
    - content: "BEGIN TRY"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. BEGIN TRY is used to handle errors and does not control transactions."
    - content: "BREAK"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The BREAK keyword is used to exit a WHILE loop and is not used to control transactions."
  - content: "What does XACT_STATE test for?"
    choices:
    - content: "Whether or not the transaction has been committed."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. XACT_STATE does not test whether a transaction has been committed."
    - content: "An error in the transaction."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. If an error occurs that causes the transaction to be classified an uncommittable, it will return -1."
    - content: "Whether or not the current transaction has finished."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. XACT_STATE tests for open transactions and not whether a transaction has completed."
  - content: "What is the default transaction isolation level for Azure SQL Database?"
    choices:
    - content: "READ_COMMITTED_SNAPSHOT_ON"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. READ_COMMITTED_SNAPSHOT_ON is the default transaction isolation level for Azure SQL Database."
    - content: "READ_COMMITTED_SNAPSHOT_OFF"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. READ_COMMITTED_SNAPSHOT_OFF is the default transaction isolation level for SQL Server."
    - content: "XACT_ABORT"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. XACT_ABORT is not a transaction isolation level."
