  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "Computer vision is based on the manipulation and analysis of what kinds of values in an image?"
    choices:
    - content: "Timestamps in photograph metadata"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Timestamps in the image metadata do not enable computer vision."
    - content: "Pixels"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Pixels are numeric values that represent shade intensity for points in the image."
    - content: "Image file names"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While file names might offer some clues as the image subject, they do not inherently enable computer vision."
  - content: "What is the primary role of filters in a convolutional neural network (CNN) used for image classification?"
    choices:
    - content: "To apply visual effects to enhance image appearance."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: ""
    - content: "To extract numeric features from images for use in a neural network."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: ""
    - content: "To compress image size for faster processing."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: ""
  - content: "What is the primary function of a multi-modal model in computer vision?"
    choices:
    - content: "To generate random captions for unlabeled images."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: ""
    - content: "To replace CNNs entirely in all vision tasks."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: ""
    - content: "To combine image features with natural language embeddings for richer understanding."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: ""
