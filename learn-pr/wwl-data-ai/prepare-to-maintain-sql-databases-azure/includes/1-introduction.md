Understanding Azure Database Administrator responsibilities, and how they relate to other Azure data platform roles, is important to performing the tasks and duties expected for this function.

In general, cloud services can be broken down into two sets of services: Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) and Platform as a Service (PaaS).

IaaS services typically consist of virtual machines, storage, and virtual networking components, and are largely managed by the user in terms of patching and software. Alternatively, PaaS services have a larger percentage of management tasks, which are handled by the cloud provider.
