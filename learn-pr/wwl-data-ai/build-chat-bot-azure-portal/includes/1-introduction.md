In today's connected world, people use a variety of technologies to communicate. For example:

- Voice calls
- Messaging services
- Online chat applications
- Email
- Social media platforms
- Collaborative workplace tools

We've become so used to ubiquitous connectivity, that we expect the organizations we deal with to be easily contactable and immediately responsive through the channels we already use. Additionally, we expect these organizations to engage with us individually, and be able to answer complex questions at a personal level.

Think about how often you communicate with other people through instant messaging, social media, email, or other online technologies. For many of us, it's our go-to form of contact. When you have a question at work, you might reach out to a colleague using a chat message, which you can use on mobile devices, so you're always in touch.

## Conversational AI

Conversational AI is the term used to describe solutions where AI agents participate in conversations with humans. Most commonly, conversational AI solutions use bots to manage dialogs with users.

Bots can be the basis of AI solutions for:

- Health care consultations and self-diagnosis.
- Home automation and personal digital assistants.
