  questions:
  - content: "You want to extract text from images and then use Azure AI Language to analyze the text. You want developers to require only one key and endpoint to access all of your services. What kind of resource should you create in your Azure subscription?"
    choices:
    - content: "Azure AI Vision"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This resource type only supports image analysis. A separate resource (with its own key and endpoint) would be required for text analytics with Azure AI Language."
    - content: "Azure AI services"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. An Azure AI services resource supports both Azure AI Vision for text extraction, and Azure AI Language for text analytics."
    - content: "Azure AI Language"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The Azure AI Language resource provides text analytics capabilities, but cannot extract text from images. A separate resource (with its own key and endpoint) would be required for text extraction from images."
  - content: "You plan to use Azure AI Vision's Read API. What results can the Read API provide?"
    choices:
    - content: "Results arranged in pages, lines, and words"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct: The Read API takes an image and extracts the words, organizing the results by page and line."
    - content: "Only the bounding box coordinates"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect: While the Read API does provide the bounding box coordinates of words, it also provides its most confident prediction of the text in the image."
    - content: "Results arranged by pages that have photographs first, then pages that exclusively have text"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect: The Read API returns results in the order of the pages submitted regardless of their content."
