Optical character recognition (OCR) has been around for a long time. The ability to recognize and extract text from documents, was one of the earliest uses. The ability to do the same extraction from images, is where the Read API can help. The Read API provides the ability to extract large amounts of typewritten or handwritten text from images. 

You can find out more about reading text with Azure AI Computer Vision in the [service documentation](/azure/ai-services/computer-vision/overview-ocr?azure-portal=true).

## Clean-up

It's a good idea at the end of a project to identify whether you still need the resources you created. Resources left running can cost you money. 

If you're continuing on to other modules in this learning path, you can keep your resources for use in other labs.

If you have finished learning, you can delete the resource group or individual resources from your Azure subscription:

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), in the **Resource groups** page, open the resource group you specified when creating your resource.

2. Click **Delete resource group**, type the resource group name to confirm you want to delete it, and select **Delete**. You can also choose to delete individual resources by selecting the resource(s), clicking on the three dots to see more options, and clicking **Delete**.
