Optical character recognition (OCR) has been around for a long time. The ability to recognize and extract text from documents, was one of the earliest uses. The ability to do the same extraction from images, is where the OCR API and the Read API can help.

Both of the APIs provide the ability to extract text from images.  The text can be typewritten or handwritten and can be at different angles within the image.  The main factor in choosing which API use is determined by the amount of text that needs to be processed.  The Read API is the service that is optimized for large text scenarios.
