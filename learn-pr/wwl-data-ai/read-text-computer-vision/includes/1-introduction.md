Suppose you have image files of road signs, advertisements, or writing on a chalk board. Machines can read the text in the images using *optical character recognition* (OCR), the capability for artificial intelligence (AI) to process words in images into machine-readable text. 

In this module, we'll focus on the use of OCR technologies to detect text in images and convert it into a text-based data format, which can then be stored, printed, or used as the input for further processing or analysis.

## Uses of OCR

Automating text processing can improve the speed and efficiency of work by removing the need for manual data entry. The ability to recognize printed and handwritten text in images is beneficial in scenarios such as note taking, digitizing medical records or historical documents, scanning checks for bank deposits, and more.
