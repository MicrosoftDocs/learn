Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed how we build applications, powering everything from chatbots to content generation systems. As you deploy these models to production, a critical question emerges: how do you know if your LLM is working well?

Evaluation is essential for successfully deploying LLMs to production. You need to understand how well your model performs, whether it produces reliable outputs, and how it behaves across different scenarios.

In this module, you'll learn to evaluate LLMs by comparing evaluation approaches, understanding how individual model evaluation fits into broader AI system assessment, applying standard metrics like accuracy and perplexity, and implementing LLM-as-a-judge techniques for scalable evaluation.
