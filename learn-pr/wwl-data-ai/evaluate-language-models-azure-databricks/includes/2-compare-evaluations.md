Evaluating Large Language Models requires understanding their unique characteristics and challenges. LLM evaluation introduces complexities that differ from traditional machine learning evaluation approaches.

These LLM-specific evaluation challenges affect how you choose evaluation methods and implement evaluation strategies.

## Explore evaluation metrics

LLM evaluation focuses on language quality dimensions that present unique measurement challenges. When you evaluate text generation, you're assessing not just correctness but also coherence, creativity, and contextual appropriateness.

The complexity comes from the subjective nature of language. Good writing varies based on audience, purpose, and context. A technical explanation needs precision and clarity, while creative content might prioritize originality and emotional impact. Since LLMs must handle this variability, your evaluation approach must account for multiple quality dimensions simultaneously.

Unlike simple classification tasks where you can measure accuracy against known labels, language generation produces open-ended outputs where multiple responses could be equally valid. This reality shapes how you design evaluation frameworks and interpret results.

To address these challenges, LLM evaluation typically combines several complementary approaches. The following sections explore key evaluation strategies and considerations for implementing effective LLM assessment.

## Include human evaluations

Human evaluation becomes necessary when assessing language quality because automated metrics can miss the nuanced aspects that make text effective. Some metrics can tell you about surface-level similarity to reference texts, but they can't judge whether your LLM's response makes sense in context or reads naturally.

Consider a customer service chatbot that generates technically accurate but robotic responses. Automated metrics might score these responses highly, but human evaluators would identify that the tone appears cold and unhelpful. Human judgment helps you understand whether your LLM produces content that's not just correct, but appropriate for its intended audience and purpose.

The challenge with human evaluation lies in scaling it effectively while maintaining consistency. You need clear evaluation criteria and trained evaluators, but you also need to balance the depth of human insight with the practical constraints of time and cost.

## Explore the interpretability of models

LLM interpretability refers to your ability to understand and explain why a model produces specific outputs. LLMs are often regarded as "black boxes," where the reasoning behind specific outputs is difficult to discern. The lack of transparency complicates their evaluation, as it's challenging to provide clear explanations for why an LLM generated a particular response or made a certain prediction.

This black box nature means you can't easily trace how the model arrived at its conclusions. When an LLM writes a creative story or answers a technical question, the internal decision-making process involves millions of parameters working together in ways that aren't straightforward to interpret. You might know what the model produced, but understanding why it chose those specific words, that particular tone, or that reasoning approach remains opaque.

This interpretability gap affects building user trust and debugging unexpected outputs, making it a consideration in your evaluation strategy.

## Assess generalization across contexts

Generalization refers to a model's ability to perform well on data or tasks it hasn't seen during training, rather than just memorizing specific examples. For LLMs, good generalization means the model can handle new topics, writing styles, and use cases beyond what it was specifically trained on.

Consider a customer service LLM trained primarily on technical support conversations. Good generalization means it can adapt when customers ask about billing, use casual language, or need help with different products. Poor generalization would show up as the model giving overly technical responses to simple questions or failing to understand requests outside its training domain.

Evaluating generalization helps ensure your LLM remains useful across the varied scenarios it encounters in real applications.

## Implement evaluation with MLflow

Azure Databricks integrates MLflow to support LLM evaluation workflows. You can use MLflow to track experiments, log evaluation metrics, compare model performance, and manage evaluation datasets. The platform integrates evaluation capabilities with other Azure Databricks features, enabling you to iterate and improve your LLM applications systematically.
