quiz:
  questions:
  - content: "How does a machine learning engineer enforce that data scientists can only edit code in feature branches?"
    choices:
    - content: "Trigger a workflow with a pull request."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Pull requests allow you to discuss proposed changes."
    - content: "Give the data scientists write access to the repo."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This will allow them to make changes to the main branch."
    - content: "Add a branch protection rule."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. When the machine learning engineer protects the main branch, data scientists will only be able to edit feature branches."
  - content: "Which event should a machine learning engineer use to trigger a GitHub Actions workflow to run when a pull request is merged?"
    choices:
    - content: "`pull_request`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This will trigger a workflow when a pull request is created."
