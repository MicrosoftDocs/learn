Azure SQL Database managed instances make it easy and quick to lift and shift a database from on-premises into the cloud. 

Suppose you work for a sports clothing retail company. Your organization has been moving many of its systems into Azure to realize improved cost-of-ownership and better availability. So far, you haven't considered migrating your business-critical databases to Azure because you've heard that databases often need modification to work in Azure SQL Database.

You want to evaluate Azure's database hosting solutions, choose the best one to host your database, and do the migration. You'd prefer to migrate with as little database administrator and developer time as possible to keep the project budget low.

In this module, you'll learn about Azure SQL Database managed instance, how it differs from other database solutions available in Azure, and how to choose the best cloud database solution for your project.

By the end of this module, you'll know how to plan and execute a database migration project to Azure SQL Database managed instance.
