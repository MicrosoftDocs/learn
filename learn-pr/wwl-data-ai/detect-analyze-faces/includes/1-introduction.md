Face detection and analysis is an area of artificial intelligence (AI) which uses algorithms to locate and analyze human faces in images or video content.

## Uses of face detection and analysis

There are many applications for face detection, analysis, and recognition. For example,

- Security - facial recognition can be used in building security applications, and increasingly it is used in smart phones operating systems for unlocking devices.
- Social media - facial recognition can be used to automatically tag known friends in photographs.
- Intelligent monitoring - for example, an automobile might include a system that monitors the driver's face to determine if the driver is looking at the road, looking at a mobile device, or shows signs of tiredness.
- Advertising - analyzing faces in an image can help direct advertisements to an appropriate demographic audience.
- Missing persons - using public cameras systems, facial recognition can be used to identify if a missing person is in the image frame.
- Identity validation - useful at ports of entry kiosks where a person holds a special entry permit.
