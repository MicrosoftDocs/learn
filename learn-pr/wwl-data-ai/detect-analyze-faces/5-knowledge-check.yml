  questions:
  - content: "How does the Face service indicate the location of faces in images?"
    choices:
    - content: "A pair of coordinates for each face, indicating the center of the face"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect: The locations of detected faces are indicated by coordinates for a rectangular bounding box"
    - content: "Two pairs of coordinates for each face, indicating the location of the eyes"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect: The locations of detected faces are indicated by coordinates for a rectangular bounding box"
    - content: "A set of coordinates for each face, defining a rectangular bounding box around the face"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct: The locations of detected faces are indicated by coordinates for a rectangular bounding box"
  - content: "What is one aspect that might impair facial detection?"
    choices:
    - content: "Glasses"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect: That attribute isn't listed as an impairment to detection."
    - content: "Extreme angles"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct: Best results are obtained when the faces are full-frontal or as near as possible to full-frontal"
    - content: "Fast shutter speed"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect: Shutter speed applies to video more than images however, faster shutter speeds tend to create a sharper image, which is beneficial to facial detection"
  - content: "What two actions are required to try out the capabilities of the Face service?"
    choices:
    - content: "Create an Azure Cognitive Search resource, and open Vision Studio"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect: Azure Cognitive Search doesn't have face detection capabilities."
    - content: "Create a Face resource, and open Vision Studio"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct: The Face resource has face detections capabilities, and can be used in Vision Studio to understand its capabilities."
    - content: "Create a Face resource, and open Azure OpenAI Studio"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect: Azure OpenAI Studio doesn't include face detection capabilities."
