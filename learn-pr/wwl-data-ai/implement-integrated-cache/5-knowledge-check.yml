      explanation: "Incorrect. Setting the consistency level correctly is a part of enabling the integrated cache, but it doesn't influence the time items remain in the cache."
    - content: "``DedicatedGatewayRequestOptions.MaxIntegratedCacheStaleness``"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The ``MaxIntegratedCacheStaleness`` property configures a **TimeSpan** that is used to determine how long items remain in the cache."
