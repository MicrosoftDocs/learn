In a short few years, generative AI, a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on creating new content, has changed the way we work and revolutionized what is possible with technology. At times, the fast-moving developments in generative AI can feel challenging to keep track of even for seasoned developers.  

In this module, gain a framework for understanding generative AI applications and how Microsoft Azure AI supports innovation. What does today's innovation look like? Consider these use cases:  

- *Marketing Content Creation*: Companies use Microsoft Copilot's generative AI to automatically write product descriptions, blog posts, and social media content—saving time and ensuring brand consistency across platforms.

- *Customer Support*: Businesses deploy AI-powered virtual agents that can understand and respond to customer inquiries in natural language, offering 24/7 support and reducing the load on human agents.

- *Code Generation*: Developers use tools like GitHub Copilot to generate code snippets, suggest functions, and even write entire modules based on natural language prompts, speeding up software development.

- *Image and Video Generation*: Designers and content creators use the latest models in Azure AI Foundry's model catalog to generate visuals for campaigns, storyboards, or concept art—often from just a text description.

- *Personalized Learning and Tutoring*: Educational platforms use generative AI to create custom quizzes, explanations, and study guides tailored to a student’s learning style and progress.

Microsoft offers an ecosystem of tools for AI use and development. This module takes a closer look at tools for developers to build generative AI applications. Next, explore the landscape of generative AI applications.
