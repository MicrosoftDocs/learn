In this module, you learned how generative AI applications are powered by language models that serve as the core logic behind user interactions. These applications often appear as assistants and agents. The applications can be grouped by the level of customization needed for their use. The rest of the module focused on Azure AI Foundry, a unified platform for building generative AI applications. 

You explored generative AI in Azure AI Foundry portal, where users have the ability to build with an extensive model marketplace, test capabilities, deploy, and observe models. You also learned that with Azure AI Foundry, developers can examine Azure AI services and integrate them into their generative AI applications.
