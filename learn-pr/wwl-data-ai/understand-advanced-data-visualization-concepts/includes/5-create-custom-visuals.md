If your organization relies on open-source languages like R and Python, you can write scripts to transform data and create visualizations. Using R and Python visuals in Power BI extends the opportunity to collaborate with Data Scientists in your organization, and enables the use of visuals your data team may already be using.

> [!NOTE]
> This module won't go in-depth for creating R and Python visuals, however you can review the [Add an R or Python visual](/training/modules/visuals-power-bi/6-python-visual) Microsoft Learn unit for more detail.

## R visuals

In order to develop R visuals, you'll need a supported version of R installed first. Then add the R visual to the canvas, just like using a table or bar chart visual, and add your R code within the visual.

## Python visuals

To develop Python visuals, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Many Python packages are supported in Power BI, but not all. See [Learn which Python packages are supported in Power BI](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-bi/connect-data/service-python-packages-support) for a complete list of supported packages and Python visual limitations.
