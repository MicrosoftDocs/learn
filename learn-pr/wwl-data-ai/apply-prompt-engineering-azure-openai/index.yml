summary: "Prompt engineering in Azure OpenAI is a technique that involves designing prompts for natural language processing models. This process improves accuracy and relevancy in responses, optimizing the performance of the model."
abstract: |
  By the end of this module, you'll be able to:
    - Understand the concept of prompt engineering and its role in optimizing Azure OpenAI models' performance.
    - Know how to design and optimize prompts to better utilize AI models.
    - Include clear instructions, request output composition, and use contextual content to improve the quality of the model's responses.
prerequisites: |
  - Familiarity with Azure and the Azure portal.
  - An understanding of generative AI. You can learn more with [Introduction to Azure OpenAI Service](/training/modules/explore-azure-openai/).
  - Experience programming with C# or Python. If you have no previous programming experience, we recommend you complete the [Take your first steps with C#](/training/paths/csharp-first-steps/) or [Take your first steps with Python](/training/paths/python-first-steps/) learning path before starting this one.
  - Before starting this module, we recommend you complete the previous modules in the [Develop AI solutions with Azure OpenAI](/training/paths/develop-ai-solutions-azure-openai/) learning path.
