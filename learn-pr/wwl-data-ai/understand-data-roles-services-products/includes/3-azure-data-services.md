## Azure Data Services

Cloud services provide a popular solution for building scalable enterprise data storage. Organizations are rapidly moving their solutions to cloud services, rather than hosting on-premises servers. Cloud solutions can be more secure and cost-effective than deploying in-house solutions that have the added overhead of hardware, backups, and other maintenance tasks.

Microsoft Azure is a powerful cloud platform that offers extensive services for storing, processing, and analyzing data:

 -  **Azure SQL Database** \- You can deploy an Azure SQL database for relational data. This highly scalable solution offers excellent performance with virtually no downtime. As a fully managed service, backups are automated, enabling the business to concentrate on building applications.
 -  **Azure Cosmos DB** \- An Azure Cosmos DB is a nonrelational, high performance database for applications such as mobile, gaming, and monitoring devices. It's fully managed and, in Cosmos DB, data is stored in documents rather than in a tabular format.
 -  **Azure Storage** \- Azure Storage is a general purpose data store for keeping and retrieving files in the cloud. For example, you can export files from a third-party service, upload them to the cloud, then process them into your Azure SQL database using application code. A secure and stable service, Azure Storage is also fully managed.
 -  **Azure Synapse Analytics** \- You can use the Azure Synapse Analytics service to transfer data from multiple sources into a centralized data warehouse. You then connect to the service using Microsoft Power BI to shape and visualize the data as dashboards and reports.

These are a handful of the cloud services that Microsoft offers. They can be combined with other services to create end-to-end cloud solutions for applications and reporting.

In this video, you'll see how the above services seamlessly combine to create a data warehouse for reporting:
