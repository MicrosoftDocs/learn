  questions:
  - content: "Data in a relational database table is…"
    choices:
    - content: "Structured"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Relational databases contain structured data in tables."
    - content: "Semi-structured"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Semi-structured data is typically stored in NoSQL data stores, such as Azure Cosmos DB."
    - content: "Unstructured"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Unstructured data may be stored in a relational database, but a table isn't unstructured."
  - content: "In a data lake, data is stored in?"
    choices:
    - content: "Relational tables"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. A data lake doesn't store data in relational tables."
    - content: "Files"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Data in a data lake is stored in files."
    - content: "A single JSON document"
      isCorrect: false

  - content: "What is the primary advantage of Apache Spark for big data scenarios?"
    choices:
    - content: "It stores data in relational tables"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Apache Spark is a processing framework, not a storage solution for relational tables."
    - content: "It uses parallel processing and in-memory processing"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Apache Spark is a parallel processing framework that takes advantage of in-memory processing and distributed file storage."
    - content: "It only processes structured data"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Apache Spark can process structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data."
