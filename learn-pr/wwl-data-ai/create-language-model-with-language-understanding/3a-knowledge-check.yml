  questions:
  - content: "You need to provision an Azure resource that will be used to author a new Language Understanding application. What kind of resource should you create?"
    choices:
    - content: "Text Analytics"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A Text Analytics resource can't be used to author a Language Understanding model."
    - content: "Language Understanding"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. To author a Language Understanding model, you need a Language Understanding resource."
    - content: "Cognitive Services"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. You can use a Cognitive Service resource for Language Understanding prediction, but not for authoring."
  - content: "You are authoring a Language Understanding application to support an international clock. You want users to be able to ask for the current time in a specified city, for example \"What is the time in London?\". What should you do?"
    choices:
    - content: "Define a \"city\" entity and a \"GetTime\" intent with utterances that indicate the city intent."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The intent encapsulates the task (getting the time) and the entity specifies the item to which the intent is applied (the city)."
    - content: "Create an intent for each city, each with an utterance that asks for the time in that city."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The intent is the same (get the time), the city varies and can be identified as an entity."
    - content: "Add the utterance \"What time is it in city\" to the \"None\" intent."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The None intent is used as a fallback for intents your application doesn't support."
  - content: "You have published your Language Understanding application. What information does a client application developer need to get predictions from it?"
    choices:
    - content: "The endpoint and key for the application's prediction resource"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Client applications must connect to the endpoint of the prediction resource, specifying an associated authentication key."
    - content: "The endpoint and key for the application's authoring resource"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The authoring resource is used for authoring; not prediction."
    - content: "The Azure credentials of the user who published the Language Understanding application"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. You should not share individual user credentials with other users."
