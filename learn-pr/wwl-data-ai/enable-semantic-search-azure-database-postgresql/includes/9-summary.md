Semantic search enables you to find data based on meaning rather than exact keyword matches by leveraging embedding vectors and vector similarity. This module explored how to use the `vector` and `azure_ai` extensions in Azure Database for PostgreSQL - Flexible Server to generate, store, and query embeddings for rich semantic search capabilities.

In this module, you:

- Examined the concepts of semantic search and embedding vectors.
- Understood the difference between lexical search and semantic search.
- Evaluated the capabilities provided by the `azure_ai` extension for PostgreSQL.
- Installed and explored the `vector` and `azure_ai` extensions in an Azure Database for PostgreSQL - Flexible Server database.
