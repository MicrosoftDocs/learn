The first step to implementing semantic search is to generate and store embeddings. In this exercise, you install the `vector` and `azure_ai` extensions in an Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server, then apply the extensions to store embedding vectors generated by [Azure OpenAI](/azure/ai-services/openai/overview). Finally, you get query string embedding vectors and run a vector similarity search.
