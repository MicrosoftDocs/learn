On-premises systems require cabling and racks of hardware in order to deploy a new database server. With cloud computing, this isn't necessary. One of the major benefits of cloud computing is that system resources are abstracted behind an API. 

A common term in cloud computing deployments is *infrastructure as code*. This means all your resources are defined using scripts stored in source control, making it easy to deploy them to new environments. While stateful resources don't need to be deployed as often as application code, defining your infrastructure ensures consistent implementation, reducing configuration risks and human errors.

Whether you're managing a single database or a complex multi-database setup, this module equips you with the skills to automate deployments efficiently and effectively.

## Learning objectives

After completing this module, you'll be able to:

- Describe the deployment models available on Azure
- Deploy database resources using PowerShell and Azure CLI
- Deploy an Azure Resource Manager template and Bicep
- Understand the difference between multiple command-line options
