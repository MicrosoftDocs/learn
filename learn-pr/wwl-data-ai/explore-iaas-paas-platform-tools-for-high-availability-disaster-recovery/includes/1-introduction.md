When deploying your database solution using Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), there are important considerations for implementing high availability and disaster recovery (HADR). For example, if you plan to use an Availability Group (AG), you need to understand how deploying a Windows Server Failover Cluster (WSFC) differs in this context. Are there specific considerations for AGs that differ from an on-premises solution?

On the other hand, implementing a Platform as a Service (PaaS)-based HADR solution is distinct from IaaS. In IaaS, the configuration is managed at the Azure level, whereas in PaaS, the solutions that ensure your applications and data are highly available and meet your Recovery Time Objectives (RTOs) and Recovery Point Objectives (RPOs) are configured within the database or database server itself.

By the end of this module, you'll understand what is needed to be able to deploy IaaS database platform solutions in Azure.
