AI delivers the most value when it solves clearly defined business problems. This unit shows you how to align AI to strategy, prioritize the right use cases, and measure outcomes so investments consistently move the needle.

## Define and prioritize your business needs

Start with outcomes your organization cares about—customer satisfaction, operational efficiency, revenue growth, or risk reduction. Identify use cases that map directly to these goals.

The following table provides use-case prioritization criteria:

| Criterion | What to ask | How to score |
|-----------|-------------|--------------|
| Business impact | What value does this deliver (cost, revenue, experience)? | High/Medium/Low |
| Feasibility | Do we have the data, skills, and partners? | High/Medium/Low |
| Time to value | How quickly can we get to production? | Short/Medium/Long |
| Measurability | Can we define KPIs and track them? | Yes/No |
| Risk | What are data, privacy, compliance, and bias risks? | Low/Medium/High |

> [!TIP]
> Use a simple scoring matrix and rank use-cases by total score to create a short list of high‑priority pilots.

## Measure value with the right Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

Tie each use-case to a small set of meaningful metrics:

- **Efficiency**: time saved, process cycle time, error rate
- **Customer**: Net Promoter Score, customer satisfaction score, case resolution time, and conversion lift
- **Finance**: cost per transaction, revenue uplift, margin impact
- **Risk and compliance**: incident rate, audit findings, policy adherence

> [!TIP]
> Start with 2–3 KPIs per use case and a baseline. Use A/B/N testing to validate impact.

## Manage AI like a portfolio

Treat AI investments as a portfolio to balance risk and reward:

- **Diversification**. Mix quick wins with strategic bets
- **Stage gating**. From discovery → pilot → production → scale
- **Resource allocation**. Budget to build, buy, and operate
- **Review cadence**. Quarterly portfolio reviews with exec sponsors

> [!TIP]
> Gartner finds organizations that use portfolio management are 2.4× more likely to reach mature AI implementation.

## Leadership and change

Leadership buy-in is essential. Active sponsorship and clear communication from executives accelerate adoption and ensure AI is seen as a strategic priority. When leaders champion AI, it becomes a shared priority integrated into business planning and performance metrics:

- Secure **executive sponsorship** and make AI a regular agenda item in business reviews.
- **Communicate** expected outcomes and share early wins to build momentum.

Aligning AI with business strategy ensures initiatives are purposeful, measurable, and scalable—setting the stage for enterprise‑wide transformation.

Next, ensure your technology and data foundations can deliver on these priorities.
