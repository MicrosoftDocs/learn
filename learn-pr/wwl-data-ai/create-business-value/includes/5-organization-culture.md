Technology alone won’t deliver outcomes—your culture will. This unit guides leaders on how to empower teams, foster experimentation, and scale skills across the enterprise.

## Lead from the top

Strong leadership makes AI a priority, not a project. Set direction, signal expectations, and provide the resources teams need to move from pilots to production.

- Communicate the AI vision and expected outcomes.
- Embed AI goals into performance reviews and planning cycles.
- Provide visible sponsorship and resources.

## Empower diverse teams
Diverse perspectives reduce risk and increase relevance. Build cross functional squads that bring together domain knowledge, engineering, security, and policy.

- Create cross functional squads that include domain experts, data/ML, security, and legal.
- Rotate roles to spread knowledge and avoid silos.

## Foster agile experimentation

Small bets and rapid feedback reduce uncertainty. Encourage teams to test hypotheses, learn quickly, and codify what works.

- Encourage small bets with clear hypotheses.
- Celebrate learnings (including "smart failures") and codify playbooks.
- Use short cycles and rapid feedback to improve.

## Invest in continuous learning

Skills are the currency of AI readiness. Provide role based training, hands on practice, and clear pathways for growth.

- Provide role based skilling, such as prompt engineering for subject matter experts and MLOps basics for IT.
- Offer interactive labs and micro projects with real data.
- Track skill progression and link to career paths.

> [!TIP]
> Maintain a curated catalog of approved AI tools and usage policies to reduce shadow AI risk.

## Tailor adoption to your culture

One size doesn’t fit all. Match your approach to how your organization embraces change, and balance speed with guardrails.

- For change resistant environments, start with visible quick wins and strong governance.
- For innovation driven cultures, empower autonomy with guardrails and enablement.

An inclusive, empowered culture accelerates adoption and value creation, ensuring AI becomes a sustainable capability.

With culture and skills in place, you need governance to scale responsibly. Next, design the controls and oversight that protect trust.
