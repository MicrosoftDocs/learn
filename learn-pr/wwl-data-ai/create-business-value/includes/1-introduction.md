AI is changing business and how companies operate and drive value. To succeed, an organization needs an AI strategy that takes a holistic view of external and internal organizational factors, and prioritizes key drivers throughout the stages of adoption.

AI helps organizations transform digitally by creating new experiences infused with capabilities to make them smart, fast, and helpful. To harness this potential, organizations must be ready to create, own, and operate AI-based systems. A successful AI strategy must consider cultural issues as well as business ones. Becoming an AI-ready organization requires a fundamental transformation in how you do things, how employees relate to each other, what skills they have, and what processes and principles guide your behaviors.
