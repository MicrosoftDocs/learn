AI is no longer a nice to have—it’s a competitive necessity. In this module, learn how to turn AI from a set of experiments into a dependable driver of business outcomes. We use a practical framework built on five essential drivers of AI readiness:

- Business Strategy
- Technology and Data Strategy
- AI Strategy and Experience
- Organization and Culture
- AI Governance

Across the framework, you see how to align AI with strategic priorities, build a scalable and secure foundation, accelerate adoption with the right tools, and govern responsibly. Each  AI readiness driver connects to real decisions you make as a leader: which use cases to prioritize, how to measure value, what capabilities to invest in, and how to manage risk.
