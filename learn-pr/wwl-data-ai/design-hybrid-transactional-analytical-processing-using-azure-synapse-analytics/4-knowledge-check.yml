  questions:
  - content: "Which of the following descriptions matches a hybrid transactional/analytical processing (HTAP) architecture."
    choices:
    - content: "Business applications store data in an operational data store, which is also used to support analytical queries for reporting."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. One of the goals of an HTAP solution is to avoid the overhead of supporting analytical queries in an operational data source."
    - content: "Business applications store data in an operational data store, which is synchronized with low latency to a separate analytical store for reporting and analysis."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. an HTAP solution replicates operational data to an analytical store, enabling you to perform analytics and reporting without impacting the performance of the operational system."
    - content: "Business applications store operational data in an analytical data store that is optimized for queries to support reporting and analysis."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. One of the goals of an HTAP solution is to optimize operational storage for applications without it being impacted by analytical queries."
  - content: "You want to use Azure Synapse Analytics to analyze operational data stored in a Cosmos DB for NoSQL container. Which Azure Synapse Link service should you use?"
    choices:
    - content: "Azure Synapse Link for SQL"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Azure Synapse Link for SQL integrates with SQL Server or Azure SQL Database."
    - content: "Azure Synapse Link for Dataverse"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Azure Synapse Link for Dataverse integrates with the Dataverse Power Platform data store."
    - content: "Azure Synapse Link for Azure Cosmos DB"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Azure Synapse Link for Azure Cosmos DB integrates with multiple Azure Cosmos DB APIs, including Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL."
  - content: "You plan to use Azure Synapse Link for Dataverse to analyze business data in your Azure Synapse Analytics workspace. Where is the replicated data from Dataverse stored?"
    choices:
    - content: "In an Azure Synapse dedicated SQL pool"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Dataverse data is not replicated to a dedicated Azure SQL pool."
