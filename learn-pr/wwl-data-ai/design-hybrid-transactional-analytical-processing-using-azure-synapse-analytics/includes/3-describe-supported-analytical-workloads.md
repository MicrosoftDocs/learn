The following are common use cases for using Azure Synapse Link for Azure Cosmos DB capability to address real-world business needs using operational analytics:

## Supply chain analytics, forecasting and reporting.

With supply chains generating increasing volumes of operational data every minute for orders, shipments and sales transactions, manufactures and retailers need an operational database that can scale to handle the data volumes as well as an analytical platform to get to a level of real-time contextual intelligence to stay ahead of the curve.

Azure Synapse Link for Cosmos DB allows these organizations to store data from their sales systems, ingest real-time telemetry data from in vehicle systems and integrate date from their ERP systems into a common operational store in Azure Cosmos DB and then leverage the data from Synapse analytics to enable both predictive analytics scenarios such as stock out monitoring and supply chain bottleneck management (1) in addition to enabling operational reporting directly on their operation data using standard reporting tools such as Power BI (2).
