Writing multi-document transactions in the programming language of your choice, rather than JavaScript, gives you power and flexibility. You can manage, version, and optimize your code using your team’s practices in the way you want without having to adapt to a language you may or may not want to use.

After completing this module, you'll be able to:

- Create a transactional batch and review results
- Implement optimistic concurrency control for an operation
