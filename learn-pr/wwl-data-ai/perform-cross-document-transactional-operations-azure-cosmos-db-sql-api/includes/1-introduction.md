When you write multi-document transactions in the programming language of your choice, it gives you power and flexibility. You can manage, version, and optimize your code using your teamâ€™s practices in the way you want without having to adapt to a language you may or may not want to use.

After completing this module, you'll be able to:

- Create a transactional batch and review results
- Implement optimistic concurrency control for an operation
