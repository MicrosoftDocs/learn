  questions:
  - content: "The application team is creating an application and deploying it to various regions across the globe, using a globally distributed Azure Cosmos DB account with multi-region write enabled. For each application region, the team would like the .NET client app to select a specific region for read/write operations, and then have the SDK determine fallback regions based on their proximity to the selection. Which method of the CosmosClientBuilder should the team use to accomplish this task?"
    choices:
    - content: "``CosmosClientBuilder.WithConsistencyLevel``"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The **WithConsistencyLevel** method configures the consistency level."
    - content: "``CosmosClientBuilder.WithApplicationPreferredRegions``"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The **WithApplicationPreferredRegions** method requires the application to build its own fallback list of regions."
    - content: "``CosmosClientBuilder.WithApplicationRegion``"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The **WithApplicationRegion** method only selects a single region and then let the SDK build a fallback regions list."
  - content: "The application team has a large data solution running on Azure Cosmos DB with multi-region write enabled. The team would like to write an application to read conflicts from the conflict feed and then resolve them using manual code. What resource\\[s\\] should the team create for this scenario?"
    choices:
    - content: "Just a Last Write Wins conflict resolution policy"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This default policy automatically handles conflicts without writing to the conflicts feed."
    - content: "Just a custom conflict resolution policy"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. If the team creates a custom conflict resolution policy without a stored procedure, conflicts are written to the conflicts feed."
    - content: "Both a custom conflict resolution policy and a stored procedure"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. If the stored procedure handles a conflict, then it doesn't write to the conflicts feed."
