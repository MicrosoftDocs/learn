With Azure Cosmos DB, you can enable global scale for both read and write throughput. The multi-write feature in Azure Cosmos DB makes it possible for every region to be writable so that you can elastically scale your write-heavy workloads across the globe. In this module, you will explore the multi-write functionality in Azure Cosmos DB and how to use it with the .NET SDK for Azure Cosmos DB SQL API.

After completing this module, you'll be able to:

- Configure Azure Cosmos DB for multi-region write
- Use the Azure Cosmos DB SQL API .NET SDK to select a write region for operations.
