In your Azure Databricks workspace, open the **04-Working-With-Dataframes** folder that you imported within your user folder.

Open the **2.Actions-and-transformations** notebook. Make sure you attach your cluster to the notebook before following the instructions and running the cells within.

Within the notebook, you will:

- Define and identify transformations
- Define and identify actions

After you've completed the notebook, return to this screen, and continue to the next step.
