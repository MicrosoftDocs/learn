When development speed is of the essence, open source database platforms usually are unmatched when it comes to delivering a fully managed ready to roll database for applications. Many developers prefer open source systems for this very reason. Microsoft has rounded out their relational database offerings by providing open source database platforms such as MySQL, MariaDB, and PostgreSQL. These platforms are a great compliment to the existing Azure SQL offerings.
