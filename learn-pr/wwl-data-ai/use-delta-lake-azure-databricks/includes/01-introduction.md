Delta Lake (usually just called Delta) is an open-source storage framework built on top of existing data lake formats like Parquet. It turns a regular "data lake" (which is just files in object storage) into a transactional data store that combines the flexibility of lakes with the reliability of warehouses. Delta is what makes a data lake behave like a reliable databaseâ€”without giving up the openness and scalability of lake storage.

Databricks ensures data integrity and simplifies management by supporting features like schema enforcement and time travel, which allow you to access previous versions of data and to audit data changes.
