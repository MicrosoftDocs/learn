  questions:
  - content: "What is the status code for a transient error?"
    choices:
    - content: "408"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Status code 408 is a timeout exception."
    - content: "429"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Status code 429 is a rate-limiting exception."
    - content: "503"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Status code 503 is return on a transient error."
  - content: "Which of the following tools will help you audit Azure Cosmos DB account security?"
    choices:
    - content: "Azure Cosmos DB Explorer."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Azure Cosmos DB Explorer is a standalone web-based interface that allows you to view and manage the data stored in Azure Cosmos DB."
    - content: "Insights."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Cosmos DB insights provide a view of the overall performance, failures, capacity, and operational health of all your Azure Cosmos DB resources in a unified interactive experience."
    - content: "Activity logs."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. By using audit logging and activity logs, you can monitor your account for normal and abnormal activity."
  - content: "What should you do if your requests are being rate limited because of transient service errors?"
    choices:
    - content: "Increasing the provisioned RU/s."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. If this type of request causes 429 exceptions, increasing the provisioned RU/s isn't recommended. Just increasing the provisioned RU/s won't have any impact on the occurrence of the exceptions."
    - content: "Retry the request."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Retrying the request is the only recommended solution, if the exception persists, open a support ticket from the Azure portal."
    - content: "Cache the names of the databases and containers."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Caching names is a recommendation for fixing rate limiting on metadata requests."
