  questions:
  - content: "Which of the following results does an object detection model typically return for an image?"
    choices:
    - content: "A class label and probability score for the image"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect: The classes returned by an object detection model are applicable to individual objects in the image, not the image as a whole"
    - content: "Bounding box coordinates that indicates the region of the image where all of the objects it contains are located"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect: The bounding boxes returned by an object detection model indicates the location of a single object."
    - content: "A class label, probability, and bounding box for each object in the image"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct: An object detection model predicts a class label, probability, and bounding box for each object in the image"
  - content: "You plan to use a set of images to train an object detection model, and then publish the model as a predictive service. You want to use a single Azure resource with the same key and endpoint for training and prediction. What kind of Azure resource should you create?"
    choices:
    - content: "Cognitive Services"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct: A cognitive services resource can be used for both training and prediction."
    - content: "Custom Vision"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect: Creating a Custom Vision resource for both training and prediction results in two separate resources being provisioned, each with their own key and endpoint."
    - content: "Computer Vision"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect: A Computer Vision resource cannot be used to train an object detection model from your own images."
