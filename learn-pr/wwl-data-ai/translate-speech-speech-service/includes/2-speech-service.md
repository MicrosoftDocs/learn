The Azure AI Speech service provides robust, machine learning and artificial intelligence-based speech translation services, enabling developers to add end-to-end, real-time, speech translations to their applications or services. You can use either a dedicated Azure AI Speech resource or a multi-service Azure AI Services resource.

Before you can use the service, you need to create an Azure AI Speech resource in your Azure subscription.

After creating your Azure resource, you'll need the following information to use it from a client application through one of the supported SDKs:

- The **location** in which the resource is deployed (for example, eastus)
- One of the **keys** assigned to your resource.

You can view of these values on the **Keys and Endpoint** page for your resource in the Azure portal.
