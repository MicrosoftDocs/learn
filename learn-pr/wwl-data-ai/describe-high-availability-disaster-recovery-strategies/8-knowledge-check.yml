  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "What is RPO?"
    choices:
    - content: "The number of nodes in a cluster"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. It isn't the recovery point objective."
    - content: "The point to which data needs to be recovered after a failure"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. RPO is the point in time to which a database should be recovered and equates to the maximum amount of data loss that the business is willing to accept."
    - content: "A partial database restores"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. While a partial restore may meet your RTO, it isn't the correct answer."
  - content: "What is a hybrid solution?"
    choices:
    - content: "A solution that has resources both in Azure as well as on premises or in another cloud provider"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Hybrid solutions span both on premises and Azure, or possibly Azure to another public cloud."
    - content: "A solution that uses two different database engines, for example, MySQL and SQL Server"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. A solution that uses two different database engines, for example, MySQL and SQL Server, is known as a polyglot persistent solution. It isn't hybrid."
    - content: "A solution that spans two different versions of SQL Server"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. A solution that spans two different versions of SQL Server is also not an example of a hybrid solution."
  - content: "What is available after failover with database-level protection in SQL Server?"
    choices:
    - content: "Logins, Databases, and SQL Server Agent Job"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The MSDB and Master database aren't protected so this data isn't transferred."
    - content: "Databases and SQL Server Agent jobs"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Agent jobs aren't protected."
    - content: "Whatever is in the databases; anything outside must be dealt with manually"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Database-level protection means that anything that is captured in the transaction log for a user or application database is accounted for as part of the availability feature. Anything that exists outside of the database or that isn't captured as part of the transaction log such as SQL Server Agent jobs and linked servers must be manually dealt with to ensure the destination server can function like the primary in the event of a planned or unplanned failover event."
