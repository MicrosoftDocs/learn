Implementing High Availability and Disaster Recovery (HADR) solutions for a database platform involves more than just deploying a feature. It's crucial to understand the reasons behind your choices and the strategies you're implementing.

For example, if you need to set up HADR for a virtual machine, do you know how much time you have to bring everything back online if there's a problem? Are you aware of the available options in SQL Server and the reasons for choosing one over another?

By the end of this module, you'll have a solid foundation to implement HADR solutions in Azure.
