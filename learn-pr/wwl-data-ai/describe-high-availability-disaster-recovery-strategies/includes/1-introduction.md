Implementing HADR database platform solutions is more than just deploying a feature. Understand why and what you are doing to implement the right strategy.

Suppose you need to implement high availability and disaster recovery (HADR) for an IaaS virtual machine that is running SQL Server 2019. Do you know how much time you would have to bring things back online if there was a problem? Do you know what options are available in SQL Server and the reasons for choosing one option over another?

By the end of this module, you will have a solid foundation that will allow you to implement HADR solutions in Azure.

## Learning objectives

After this module, you will understand:

- Recovery time objective (RTO)

- Recovery point objective (RPO)

- The available HADR options for both IaaS and PaaS

- How to devise a HADR strategy
