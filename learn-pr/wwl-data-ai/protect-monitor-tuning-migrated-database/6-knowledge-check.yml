  questions:
  - content: "You're writing a script that uses the Azure CLI to create and configure an Azure Database for MySQL service. You need to allow access to the service for other Azure services. Which IP address range should you specify in the `az mysql server firewall-rule create` command?"
    choices:
    - content: "Set the `start-ip-address` parameter to 0.0.0.0, and the `end-ip-address` parameter to 255.255.255.255."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Setting the `start-ip-address` parameter to 0.0.0.0, and the `end-ip-address` parameter to 255.255.255.255 will work, but is dangerous as it permits traffic from all IP addresses. There's a better answer."
    - content: "Set the `start-ip-address` and `end-ip-address` parameters to 0.0.0.0."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Set the `start-ip-address` and `end-ip-address` parameters to 0.0.0.0. , effectively disabling the firewall."
    - content: "Set the `start-ip-address` and `end-ip-address` parameters to the range defined by the subnet that contains your resources."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The firewall settings need to be set to something else."
  - content: "How do you change the server parameters for Azure Database for MySQL?"
    choices:
    - content: "Use the **Server parameters** page for the server in the Azure portal."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. The **Server parameters** page in the Azure portal enables you to change server parameters."
    - content: "You can't change server parameters. The server is managed entirely by Azure."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. You can change the server parameters."
    - content: "Connect to the server using MySQL Workbench and use the **System Variables** page to modify the server settings."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. You change these settings somewhere else."
  - content: "You're using **Query Performance Insight** to track the performance of queries running on your server. You notice that the wait statistics for one query show a significant number of lengthy IO waits. What might cause this?"
    choices:
    - content: "This could be due to a poorly designed query, an inefficient join operation, or a full table scan incurred because of a missing index."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. The most likely cause is an inefficient query and possibly a missing index. In this case, the query might be attempting to read all of the data from a large table into memory. Modifying the query to retrieve fewer rows based on an index lookup will enable better caching of the results."
    - content: "This could be caused by a high volume of network activity."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This isn't the most likely cause."
    - content: "This might be the result of connection throttling, if the server is attempting to handle a large number of concurrent requests."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This wouldn't show up as lengthy IO waits in Query Performance Insights."
