*Clustering* is a form of machine learning that is used to group similar items into clusters based on their features. For example, a researcher might take measurements of penguins, and group them based on similarities in their proportions.

Clustering is an example of *unsupervised* machine learning, in which you train a model to separate items into clusters based purely on their characteristics, or *features*. There is no previously known cluster value (or *label*) from which to train the model.

You can use Microsoft Azure Machine Learning designer to create clustering models by using a drag and drop visual interface, without needing to write any code.

In this module, you'll learn how to:

- Use Azure Machine Learning designer to train a clustering model.
- Use a clustering model for inferencing.
- Deploy a clustering model as a service.

To complete this module, you'll need a Microsoft Azure subscription. If you don't already have one, you can sign up for a free trial at [https://azure.microsoft.com](https://azure.microsoft.com?azure-portal=true).
