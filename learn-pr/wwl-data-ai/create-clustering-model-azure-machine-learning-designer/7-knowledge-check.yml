  questions:
  - content: "You are using an Azure Machine Learning designer pipeline to train and test a K-Means clustering model. You want your model to assign items to one of three clusters. Which configuration property of the K-Means Clustering module should you set to accomplish this?"
    choices:
    - content: "Set Number of Centroids to 3"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That is correct. To create K clusters, you must set the number of centroids to K"
    - content: "Set Random number seed to 3"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That is incorrect. To create K clusters, you must set the number of centroids to K"
    - content: "Set Iterations to 3"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That is incorrect. To create K clusters, you must set the number of centroids to K"
  - content: "You use Azure Machine Learning designer to create a training pipeline for a clustering model. Now you want to use the model in an inference pipeline. Which module should you use to infer cluster predictions from the model?"
    choices:
    - content: "Score Model"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That is incorrect. use the Assign Data to Clusters module to generate cluster predictions from a trained clustering model"
    - content: "Assign Data to Clusters"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That is correct. use the Assign Data to Clusters module to generate cluster predictions from a trained clustering model"
    - content: "Train Clustering Model"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That is incorrect. use the Assign Data to Clusters module to generate cluster predictions from a trained clustering model"
