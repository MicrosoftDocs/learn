When you understand the data in a dataset, you can extend and transform it using techniques that make it easy to analyze. In its most basic format, data doesn't reveal much useful information.

- Describe the different types of data that comprise a dataset.
- Sort and filter data to answer a business question.
- Understand how derived data can be added to a dataset.
