  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "Which data type would you use to store product prices?"
    choices:
    - content: "A numeric type"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Price data should be stored as a numeric type so that calculations can be performed on the column."
    - content: "A date type"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Only a date value should be stored in a column with a date type."
    - content: "A string type"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. String types are designed for text values and can't be used in calculations."
  - content: "What happens when filters are applied to a dataset?"
    choices:
    - content: "Non-matching rows are excluded from the result set"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Rows that don't match the values of the filters are excluded from the results."
    - content: "Rows that don't match the filters are deleted from the data source"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Filtering doesn't delete data from the source."
    - content: "The data is sorted in ascending order"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Filtering doesn't apply any sorting to the results."
  - content: "What is derived data?"
    choices:
    - content: "A table of columns and rows copied from another dataset"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Duplicating an existing table copies the data but doesn't add a derived field to a dataset."
    - content: "A new row added to the dataset"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Inserting a new row doesn't create a derived field."
    - content: "A new column added to a dataset using data that exists in the dataset"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Derived data is based on the data already present in the dataset."
  - content: "What is the key purpose of visual indicators?"
    choices:
    - content: "They make reports more aesthetic"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The aesthetic appearance of a report isn't the key purpose of a visual indicator."
    - content: "They cause other processes to run"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Visual indicators don't cause other processes to run."
    - content: "They enable you to quickly see patterns in the data"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. A visual indicator highlights data so you can quickly see patterns without having to dive deeply into it."
