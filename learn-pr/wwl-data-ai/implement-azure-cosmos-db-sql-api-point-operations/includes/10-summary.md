In this module, you used the Azure Cosmos DB SDK to perform some of the most common operations that your applications perform on individual items. These operations will often be the individual building blocks of bigger bulk and transactional operations that you may build in the future.

Now that you completed this module, you can:

- Perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on a specific item using the SDK
- Update the TTL (time to live) value of a specific item using the SDK
