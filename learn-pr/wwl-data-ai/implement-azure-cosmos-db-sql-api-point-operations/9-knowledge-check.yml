    choices:
    - content: "Both an ID and partition key value"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. You can perform a point read with both the ID and partition key values."
    - content: "Only an ID"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Both a partition key value and ID are required to perform a point read operation in Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL."
    - content: "Only a partition key value"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Both a partition key value and ID are required to perform a point read operation in Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL."
  - content: "Which method should you use to update an item in Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL using the .NET SDK?"
    choices:
    - content: "PatchItemAsync<>"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. There's a separate set of methods to patch items in the SDK."
    - content: "UpdateItemAsync<>"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This method doesn't exist in the SDK."
    - content: "ReplacesItemAsync<>"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. The ReplaceItemAsync<> method takes in an item as the method parameter and updates the item. You can alternatively use UpsertItemAsync<> but this is less efficient as it attempts an insert first."

      explanation: "That's correct. The Microsoft.Azure.Cosmos.Container class contains methods for CRUD operations on items."
    - content: "CosmosClient"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. First access the Microsoft.Azure.Cosmos.Container class to perform CRUD operations on items."
