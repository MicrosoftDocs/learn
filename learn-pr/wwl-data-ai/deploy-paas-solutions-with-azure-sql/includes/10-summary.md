In this module, you learned about the platform as a service options for SQL Server on Azure. Azure SQL Database is a flexible platform, well suited for software as service applications and has many options for large databases, multiple databases, or development environments that don't need to be online 24x7. Azure SQL Managed Instance is a PaaS version of SQL Server that allows you to easily move your on-premises environments into a managed service. SQL Managed Instance also supports many server-level capabilities that aren't available with Azure SQL Database.

Now that you've reviewed this module, you should be able to:

- Understand PaaS provisioning and deployment options
- Understand elastic pools and hyperscale features
- Examine SQL Managed Instances
