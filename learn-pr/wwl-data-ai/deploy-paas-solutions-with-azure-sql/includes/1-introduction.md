The Platform as a Service (PaaS) offering for SQL Server can be a great solution for certain workloads. The PaaS offering provides less granular control over the infrastructure. It also relegates management of the underlying components (memory, CPU, storage, operating system, etc.) to Microsoft Azure.

This module focuses on ways to provision and deploy Azure SQL Database and Azure SQL managed instances, as well as provide guidance on the various options when performing a migration to these platforms.

## Learning objectives

At the end of this module, you'll be able to:

- Understand PaaS provisioning and deployment options
- Understand elastic pools and hyperscale features
- Examine SQL Managed Instances
