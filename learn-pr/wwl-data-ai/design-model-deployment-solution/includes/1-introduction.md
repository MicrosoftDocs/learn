As a data scientist, you want to train a machine learning model that helps others. Whether you're training a model to help your colleagues be more productive or to improve the user experience for your customers.

To ensure that your model is used by your target audience, you need to deploy your model to an endpoint. The endpoint can be integrated into a service or application to serve the users of the model. You should design a solution for deploying the model that best meets the needs of the users and takes into account the requirements of the model being deployed.

You'll learn how to design a model deployment solution and how the requirements of the deployed model can affect the way you train a model.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you'll learn how to:

- Understand how a model will be consumed.
- Decide whether to deploy your model to a real-time or batch endpoint.
