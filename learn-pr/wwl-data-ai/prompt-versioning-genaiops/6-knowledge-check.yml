  questions:
  - content: "Why is version control important for AI prompts in production environments?"
    choices:
    - content: "It allows you to track changes, roll back problematic prompts, and maintain consistency across deployments."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Version control provides essential capabilities for managing prompt changes safely in production."
    - content: "It automatically improves prompt performance through machine learning."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Version control doesn't automatically improve prompt performance - it provides management capabilities."
    - content: "It eliminates the need for testing prompts before deployment."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Version control complements testing but doesn't replace the need for thorough prompt validation."
  - content: "Which GitHub repository structure best supports prompt versioning for GenAIOps workflows?"
    choices:
    - content: "A single file containing all prompts without any organization"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A single unorganized file makes it difficult to manage multiple prompts and their versions."
    - content: "Organized folders with clear naming conventions, separate files for each prompt, and documentation"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. A well-structured repository with clear organization supports better prompt management and collaboration."
    - content: "Binary files that cannot be easily read or compared"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Binary files don't support the transparency and diff capabilities needed for effective version control."
  - content: "What is the recommended approach for testing prompt changes before production deployment?"
    choices:
    - content: "Test directly in production to get real user feedback"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Testing directly in production introduces unnecessary risks and potential user impact."
    - content: "Create a branch, test the prompt changes, document performance differences, and use pull requests for review"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. This approach follows software engineering best practices and enables safe prompt iteration."
    - content: "Make changes without testing since prompts are just text"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Prompt changes can significantly impact AI behavior and should always be tested thoroughly."
