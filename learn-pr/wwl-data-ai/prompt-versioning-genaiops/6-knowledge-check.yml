  questions:
  - content: "What happens when you create or update an agent in Microsoft Foundry?"
    choices:
    - content: "The existing agent version is overwritten with no history."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Microsoft Foundry preserves agent version history."
    - content: "A new agent version is created automatically, whether you use the portal or the Python SDK."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Microsoft Foundry creates a new version whenever you create or update an agent, maintaining version history."
    - content: "Version numbers must be manually assigned in your code."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Microsoft Foundry automatically assigns incremental version numbers."
  - content: "In a proper prompt workflow, what should happen before a prompt change reaches production?"
    choices:
    - content: "Changes should be deployed immediately to get real user feedback."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Deploying directly to production skips critical validation steps."
    - content: "Changes should be tested in development, validated in staging, reviewed by the team, and then deployed with monitoring."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. This systematic approach ensures changes are validated at each stage before impacting users."
    - content: "Only the person who wrote the prompt needs to approve it."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Team review provides valuable perspective and catches issues the author might miss."
  - content: "What do Git tags provide for agent deployments?"
    choices:
    - content: "They automatically deploy agents to production."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Git tags mark versions but don't trigger deployments by themselves."
    - content: "They create a traceable relationship between repository versions and deployed agents, simplifying debugging and rollback."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Git tags enable you to quickly identify which repository state corresponds to any deployed agent version."
    - content: "They replace the need for commit messages."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Tags complement commit messages by marking specific deployment milestones."
