Managing prompts with version control transforms AI agent development from ad-hoc changes into systematic operations. You learned how Microsoft Foundry automatically versions agents, how to organize prompts in GitHub repositories with appropriate file formats and naming conventions, and how to establish safe deployment workflows using branches, pull requests, and Git tags. 

By applying these software engineering practices to prompt management, you can track changes, collaborate effectively with your team, test modifications before production deployment, and quickly roll back when issues arise. This foundation enables you to iterate rapidly on AI agents while maintaining reliability and accountability in production environments.
