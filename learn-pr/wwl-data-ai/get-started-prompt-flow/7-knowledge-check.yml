quiz:
  questions:
  - content: "A flow uses an LLM tool to generate text with a GPT-3.5 model. What do you need to create to ensure prompt flow can securely call the deployed model from Azure Open AI?"
    choices:
    - content: "Runtimes"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Runtimes provide the necessary compute to run the flow."
    - content: "Connections"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Create a connection to allow prompt flow to securely communicate with Azure Open AI."
    - content: "Tools"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. You use tools when adding nodes to your flow. Though a tool provides the functionality, it doesn't allow you to safely store connection information."
  - content: "You want to integrate your flow with an online website. What do you need to do to easily integrate your flow?"
    choices:
    - content: "Create a custom environment."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. You create a custom environment when you need extra packages to be installed to run your flow."
    - content: "Create a runtime."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A runtime is needed to run your flow, during development and testing."
    - content: "Deploy your flow to an endpoint."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. When you deploy a flow to an endpoint, prompt flow generates a URL and key that the website can use to call the flow for real-time predictions."
  - content: "After deployment, you notice that your flow is underperforming. Which stage in the development lifecycle should you revert back to?"
    choices:
    - content: "Experimentation"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Revert back to the experimentation stage to develop and test your flow with a small dataset."
    - content: "Evaluation and refinement"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Only move to evaluation and refinement to test your flow with a larger dataset when you developed and tested it with a smaller dataset first."
    - content: "Production"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. During production you deploy and monitor the flow."
