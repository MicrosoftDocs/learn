Employers are looking for specific markers of readiness and skill attainment when hiring. They're seeking out candidates with industry recognized technical certification like those from Microsoft. As a faculty member teaching the Microsoft Official Course and setting up your students up for success, you play a pivotal role in ensuring your students get certified.

To prepare you for delivering cutting-edge technical instruction in your classes, we suggest that all faculty members get certified in the content they'll be teaching. One of the benefits provided through Microsoft Learn for Educators is a discounted Microsoft certification exam voucher for Microsoft Fundamentals certification and a free Microsoft certification exam voucher for Microsoft Advanced Role Based certification for the course you're going to be teaching. This is an important opportunity to have firsthand experience with the exam that you're preparing your students to take.
