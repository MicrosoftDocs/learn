Suppose you're working for a data analytics startup that's now expanding along with its increasing customer base. You receive customer data from multiple sources in different raw formats. Your company has already invested in Azure Databricks to efficiently handle huge amounts of customer data. You have taken advantage of `DataFrames` to move beyond simple data-handling functions, but now there are specific column-level transformations you need to perform.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you'll:

- Learn the syntax for specifying column values for filtering and aggregations
- Understand the use of the Column Class
- Sort and filter a DataFrame based on Column Values
- Use `collect()` and `take()` to return records from a Dataframe to the driver of the cluster
