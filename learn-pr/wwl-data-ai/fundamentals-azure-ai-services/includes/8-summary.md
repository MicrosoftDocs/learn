Azure AI services are easy to use AI capabilities made available as resources on the Azure platform. Azure AI service capabilities include Language, Speech, Vision, Decision, Search, and Azure OpenAI.

In this module we’ve used several different terms relating to AI services. Here's a recap:
- **API** – application programming interfaces (APIs) enable software components to communicate, so one side can be updated without stopping the other from working.
- **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** – computer programs that respond in ways that are normally associated with human reasoning, learning, and thought. 
- **Azure AI services** – a portfolio of AI services that can be incorporated into applications quickly and easily without specialist knowledge. **Azure AI services** is also the name for the multi-service resource created in the Azure portal that provides access to several different Azure AI services with a single key and endpoint. 
- **Endpoint** – the location of a resource, such as an Azure AI service.
- **Key** – a private string that is used to authenticate a request. 
- **Machine learning** – the ability for computer programs to learn from large amounts of data, in a process known as "training".
- **Multi-service resource** – the AI service resource created in the Azure portal that provides access to a bundle of AI services.
- **Single-service resource** – a resource created in the Azure portal that provides access to a single Azure AI service, such as Speech, Vision, Language, etc. Each Azure AI service has a unique key and endpoint.
- **RESTful API** – a scalable web application programming interface used to access Azure AI services.

You can find out more about Azure AI services in the [service documentation](/azure/ai-services?azure-portal=true).
