  questions:
  - content: "Contoso is migrating an on-premise HBase cluster to HDInsight and is concerned around possible Write latency issues with HBase and is looking to improve write performance on HBase .Which solution from the below list would you look to offer?"
    choices:
    - content: "Migrate to HBase on IaaS on Azure."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This would require a lot of effort, and cost to implement and may not even meet the same performance levels as HDInsight HBase with Accelerated Writes."
    - content: "Migrate to HDInsight HBase with Accelerated Writes."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. HDInsight HBase with Accelerated Writes attaches a Premium SSD Managed disk to every HBase Region Server (Worker Node) during cluster deployment."
    - content: "Migrate to HDInsight HBase Regular."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. In the HDInsight HBase offering, HBase Write Ahead Logs (WAL) are stored in Azure Page Blobs."
  - content: "Contoso is looking to improve the Read performance of HDInsight HBase clusters. Which solution from the below list would you look to offer in addition to Accelerated Writes?"
    choices:
    - content: "Use faster networking."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The root cause of performance will likely be affected by disk access"
    - content: "Use Azure Page Blobs."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Azure Page Blobs By default, HDInsight HBase provisions a storage account of type Storage (general purpose v1)."
    - content: "Use Premium Block Blobs."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Premium Block Blobs provides high performance disk access to improve Read performance of HDInsight HBase clusters"
  - content: "Contoso’s business continuity strategy calls for enabling Azure cross region asynchronous replication between HDInsight HBase clusters. What solution would you recommend?"
    choices:
    - content: "Import Export."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The Import Export feature exports selected tables to the local storage that is attached to the cluster. Post export the tables can then me imported from the target cluster."
    - content: "hbase folder copy."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The hbase folder copy does not enable Azure cross region asynchronous replication between HDInsight HBase clusters, it is used to manually move data."
    - content: "HBase replication."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. HBase replication enables Azure cross region asynchronous replication between HDInsight HBase clusters."
