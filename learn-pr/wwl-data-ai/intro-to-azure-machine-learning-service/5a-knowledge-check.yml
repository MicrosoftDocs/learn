  questions:
  - content: "Which of the following descriptions accurately describes Azure Machine Learning?"
    choices:
    - content: "A Python library that you can use as an alternative to common machine learning frameworks like Scikit-Learn, PyTorch, and Tensorflow."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This is incorrect. Azure Machine Learning enables you to manage machine learning model data preparation, training, validation, and deployment. It supports existing frameworks such as Scikit-Learn, PyTorch, and Tensorflow; and provides a cross-platform platform for operationalizing machine learning in the cloud."
    - content: "A cloud-based platform for operating machine learning solutions at scale."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That is correct. Azure Machine Learning enables you to  manage machine learning model data preparation, training, validation, and deployment. It supports existing frameworks such as Scikit-Learn, PyTorch, and Tensorflow; and provides a cross-platform platform for operationalizing machine learning in the cloud."
    - content: "An application for Microsoft Windows that enables you to create machine learning models by using a drag and drop interface."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This is incorrect. Azure Machine Learning enables you to manage machine learning model data preparation, training, validation, and deployment. It supports existing frameworks such as Scikit-Learn, PyTorch, and Tensorflow; and provides a cross-platform platform for operationalizing machine learning in the cloud."
  - content: "You are using the Azure Machine Learning Python SDK to write code for an experiment. You must log metrics from each run of the experiment, and be able to retrieve them easily from each run. What should you do?"
    choices:
    - content: "Add print statements to the experiment code to print the metrics."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That is incorrect. To record metrics in an experiment run, use the Run.log* methods."
    - content: "Save the experiment data in the outputs folder."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That is incorrect. To record metrics in an experiment run, use the Run.log* methods."
    - content: "Use the log\\* methods of the Run class to record named metrics."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That is correct. To record metrics in an experiment run, use the Run.log\\* methods."
