quiz:
  questions:
  - content: "What is the correct method to log a model metric, `_rmse`, in MLflow?"
    choices:
    - content: "`mlflow.log(\"RMSE\", _rmse)`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. MLflow module provides “fluent” APIs and log_metric() is the correct method to log a model metric."
    - content: "`mlflow.log_artifact(\"RMSE\", _rmse)`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. MLflow module provides “fluent” APIs and log_metric() is the correct method to log a model metric."
    - content: "`mlflow.log_metric(\"RMSE\", _rmse)`"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. MLflow module provides “fluent” APIs and log_metric() is the correct method to log a model metric."
  - content: "Leon wants to run an Azure Machine Learning experiment in Azure Databricks. An MLflow experiment is configured and Leon is about to run it. He realizes he forgot a step. What should have been done first?"
    choices:
    - content: "Register the model in Azure Machine Learning."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. A model doesn't need to be registered to run an experiment."
    - content: "Log the experiment metrics with MLflow."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Metrics don't need to be logged to run an experiment."
    - content: "Configure MLflow tracking URI to use Azure Machine Learning."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. First, the MLflow tracking URI needs to be configured to use AML."
  - content: "You want to run an Azure Machine Learning Pipeline. The first step of the pipeline is to preprocess the data by running a Python script on Azure Databricks Compute. The configuration is defined and now you need to create the compute. Which type of object should you use?"
    choices:
    - content: "DatabricksAttachConfiguration"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. DatabricksAttachConfiguration is used to define the configuration parameters for attaching Databricks Compute targets but doesn't create the compute."
    - content: "ComputeTarget"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. After defining the configuration, ComputeTarget should be used to create the compute."
    - content: "DatabricksCompute"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. DatabricksCompute is used to manage a Databricks compute target, not create it."
