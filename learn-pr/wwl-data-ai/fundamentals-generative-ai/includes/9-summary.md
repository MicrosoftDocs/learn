Generative AI is a rapidly developing field of AI that supports new language generation, code development, image creation, and more. You learned about advancements in natural language processing (NLP), the creation of large language models (LLMs), and key concepts such as tokenization, word embeddings, and adding memory to language models. The module introduced the transformer architecture, which revolutionized text understanding and generation. 

You also learned about the two categories of language models: Large Language Models (LLMs) and Small Language Models (SLMs), their differences, and their deployment. The module also emphasized the influence of user prompts on the effectiveness of generative AI assistants and the concept of 'prompt engineering'. Lastly, you learned about the mechanisms used to enhance generative AI models, the four-stage process for responsible generative AI use, and the six principles of responsible AI.
