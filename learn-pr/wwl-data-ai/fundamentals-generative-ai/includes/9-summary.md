Generative AI is a rapidly developing field of AI that supports new language generation, code development, image creation, and more. In this module, you've explored how generative AI uses large language models to make sense of language, and how you can interact with these models using prompts. You've also learned how AI agents, built on generative AI, can act as digital assistants that collaborate with you to find information and accomplish tasks.
