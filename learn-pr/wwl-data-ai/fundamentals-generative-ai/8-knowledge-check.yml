quiz:
  questions:
  - content: "What is a *large language model* (LLM)?"
    choices:
    - content: "A type of AI model designed to generate human-like text."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! A large language model (LLM) is designed to generate human-like text based on the input it receives."
    - content: "A model that only processes images, not text."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. LLMs are designed for text processing."
    - content: "A small, efficient model for mobile devices."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. LLMs are typically large and require significant computational resources."
  - content: "What is the purpose of *tokenization*?"
    choices:
    - content: "To sort the words in a sentence alphabetically"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Tokenization isn't about sorting words alphabetically."
    - content: "To break down text into smaller units."
      isCorrect: true 
      explanation: "Correct! Tokenization is the process of converting text into individual tokens; which can be words, sub-words, or other meaningful elements."
    - content: "To convert text into binary code for processing by computers."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Tokenization isn't about converting text into binary code."
  - content: "What are *embeddings*?"
    choices:
    - content: "Extra words added by a transformer model to enhance text generation."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Embeddings aren't extra words added by the transformer model."
    - content: "Small language models used for specific tasks."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Embeddings aren't small language models."
    - content: "Vector-based representations of tokens that capture their semantic meaning."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! Embeddings are vector-based representations of tokens that capture their semantic meaning."
  - content: "What does an *attention* layer do in a transformer model?"
    choices:
    - content: "Removes irrelevant words from the input text."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Attention layers don't remove irrelevant words."
    - content: "Examines the relationships between each token and the tokens around it."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! Attention layers examine the relationships between each token and the tokens around it."
    - content: "Flags inappropriate content in the generated text."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Attention layers don't flag inappropriate content."
  - content: "What is the purpose of a *system prompt*?"
    choices:
    - content: "To provide context and instructions to the AI model."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! A system prompt is used to give context and instructions to the AI model, guiding its responses."
    - content: "To configure a generative AI model to run on a particular operating system."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A system prompt isn't related to the operating system configuration."
    - content: "To store user preferences for future interactions."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A system prompt doesn't store user preferences."
  - content: "What is an *agent* in the context of AI?"
    choices:
    - content: "An AI system that can perform tasks on behalf of a user."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! An agent in AI is a system that can autonomously perform tasks or make decisions on behalf of a user."
    - content: "A generative AI model that operates in secret."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. An agent isn't defined by its operational transparency."
    - content: "A human operator to whom generative AI models escalate requests they can't handle."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. An agent isn't a human operator."
