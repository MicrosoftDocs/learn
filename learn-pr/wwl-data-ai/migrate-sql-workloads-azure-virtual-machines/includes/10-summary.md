Careful planning is essential for a successful SQL Server migration, which involves addressing both the **how** and **why** aspects of the migration. Understanding the benefits of migration entails recognizing the benefits after the migration is completed, while the how encompasses the selection of appropriate migration tools and the development of a comprehensive migration plan. A critical element in this process is to evaluate the amount of downtime that the organization is willing to tolerate. Minimizing downtime during the migration process is crucial to maintaining operational efficiency and continuity. 

You've learned different tools and features to support and migrate SQL Server databases to SQL Server running on an Azure Virtual Machine, including Azure SQL Migration extension, back up and restore with Azure Blob Storage, Detach and attach from a URL, log shipping, Azure Migrate, Data Migration Assistant (DMA), and a few others. The method chosen to migrate the database is typically dependent on how much time the SQL Server databases can be offline.
