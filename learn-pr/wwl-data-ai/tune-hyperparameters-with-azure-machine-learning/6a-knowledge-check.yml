  questions:
  - content: "You plan to use hyperparameter tuning to find optimal discrete values for a set of hyperparameters. You want to try every possible combination of a set of specified discrete values. Which kind of sampling should you use?"
    choices:
    - content: "Random Sampling"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That is incorrect. You should use a Grid sampling to try every combination of discrete hyperparameter values."
    - content: "Grid Sampling"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That is correct. You should use a Grid sampling to try every combination of discrete hyperparameter values."
    - content: "Bayesian Sampling"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That is incorrect. You should use a Grid sampling to try every combination of discrete hyperparameter values."
  - content: "You are using hyper parameter tuning to train an optimal model based on a target metric named \"AUC\". What should you do in your training script?"
    choices:
    - content: "Import the logging package and use a logging.info() statement to log the AUC"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That is incorrect. Your script needs to use the Azure ML run context to log the primary metric to the run using the same name as specified in the hyperdrive config."
    - content: "Include a print() statement to write the AUC value to the standard output stream"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That is incorrect. Your script needs to use the Azure ML run context to log the primary metric to the run using the same name as specified in the hyperdrive config."
    - content: "Get a reference to the Azure ML run context and use a run.log() statement to write the AUC value to the run log"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That is correct. Your script needs to log the primary metric to the run using the same name as specified in the hyperdrive config."
