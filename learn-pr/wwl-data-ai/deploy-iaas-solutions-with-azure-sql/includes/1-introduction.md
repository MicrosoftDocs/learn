The most common reason for deploying SQL Server in an Azure Virtual Machine (VM) is because you want an easy, straightforward method to migrate an existing on-premises SQL Server into the cloud. 

Understanding the options and methods for deploying SQL Server in an Azure VM is critical to ensure a successful migration. Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) allows for greater flexibility in configuration. This flexibility means that you, as a database administrator, must plan your configuration carefully. Choosing the proper VM sizing, storage, and networking options are crucial to ensure adequate performance for your workloads.
