quiz:
  questions:
  - content: "Where can you test a deployed model in the Azure AI Foundry portal?"
    choices:
    - content: "Chat playground"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The chat playground is designed for interactive testing and experimentation with deployed models, allowing you to explore how the model responds in real-time."
    - content: "Sandbox"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A sandbox is typically a safe environment for testing code changes, but it isn't designed for testing deployed language models."
    - content: "Development toolbox"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The development toolbox can contain various tools for development purposes, but it isn't the place where you would test a deployed model."
  - content: "You want to specify the tone, format, and content for each interaction with your model in the playground. What should you use to customize the model response?"
    choices:
    - content: "Benchmarks"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Benchmarks are used to compare the performance of models, not to customize individual model responses."
    - content: "Grounding"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Grounding is a technique used to provide context or background information to a model, not to customize its responses."
    - content: "System message"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. System messages are used to customize the model's responses by specifying the tone, format, and content for each interaction."
  - content: "What deployment options for an OpenAI model incur no cost for deployment and charge for inferencing based on token-based billing?"
    choices:
    - content: "Only Azure OpenAI Service"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Azure OpenAI Service is not the only option for the required deployment criteria."
    - content: "Only managed compute"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Managed compute is charged per-minute."
    - content: "Either Azure OpenAI Service or Azure AI Model Inferencing Service"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. You can deploy OpenAI mdoels to either Azure OpenAI Service or Azure AI Model Inferencing Service."
