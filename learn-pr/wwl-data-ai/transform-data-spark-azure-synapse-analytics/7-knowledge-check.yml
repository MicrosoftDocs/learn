  questions:
  - content: "Which method of the Dataframe object is used to save a dataframe as a file?"
    choices:
    - content: "toFile()"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The write() method is the correct way to write a DataFrame as a file."
    - content: "write()"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. The write() method to save a DataFrame as a file."
    - content: "save()"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The write() method is the correct way to write a DataFrame as a file."
  - content: "Which method is used to split the data across folders when saving a dataframe?"
    choices:
    - content: "splitBy()"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The partitionBy method is the correct method to partition data across folders"
    - content: "distributeBy()"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The partitionBy method is the correct method to split across folders when saving a DataFrame."
    - content: "partitionBy()"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. This method is an expressive and convenient operation in PySpark, which partitions the DataFrame based on given columns and distributes the partitions across the nodes in the cluster."
  - content: "What happens if you drop an external table that is based on existing files?"
    choices:
    - content: "An error â€“ you must delete the files first"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The files and table are loosely coupled, deleting the files doesn't remove the table from the metastore."
    - content: "The table is dropped from the metastore but the files remain unaffected"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. The tables are loosely coupled from the files allowing the table to be dropped while the files remain."
    - content: "The table is dropped from the metastore and the files are deleted"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The files are loosely coupled and dropping the table has no impact on the existing files."
