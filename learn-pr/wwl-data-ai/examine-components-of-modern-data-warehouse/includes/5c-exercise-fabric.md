In this exercise, you'll create a Microsoft Fabric workspace and use it to ingest and analyze some data.

The exercise is designed to familiarize you with some key elements of a large-scale data analytics solution, not as a comprehensive guide to performing advanced data analysis with Microsoft Fabric. The exercise should take around 25 minutes to complete.

> [!NOTE]
> You need a Microsoft Fabric trial license with the Fabric preview enabled in your tenant. See [Getting started with Fabric](/fabric/get-started/fabric-trial) to enable your Fabric trial license.

Launch the exercise and follow the instructions.
