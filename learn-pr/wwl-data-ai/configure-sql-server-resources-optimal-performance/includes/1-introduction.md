One of the challenges administrators face in the cloud is balancing costs and performance. Both Azure and SQL Server provide many options for configuration to meet the needs of small and large workloads. Choosing the right storage and sizing your virtual machine are critical steps in meeting the performance needs of your applications and balancing cloud costs. Proper configuration of SQL Server resources like TempDB which can easily become a performance bottleneck, and Resource Governor, which can be used to manage multi-tenant workloads, are also important for properly maintaining your server performance.

- Understand your options for configuration of Azure storage
