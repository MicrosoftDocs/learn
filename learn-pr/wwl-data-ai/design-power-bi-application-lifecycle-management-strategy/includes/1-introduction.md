Power BI can be combined with other products, such as OneDrive and Azure DevOps, to manage the analytics development lifecycle in your organization.

Suppose you're an Enterprise Data Analyst supporting Power BI reports at a large healthcare organization. While you initially started creating reports in your department from existing databases, you're now collaborating on reports with fellow team members and other departments as well. In the past, you've had to completely rebuild a report after a peer accidentally overwrote your report with a different report. Your team's Power BI workspaces are also cluttered, and you have to check with everyone before you can publish reports to production. You need organization and tracking systems to reduce administrative overhead.

In this module, we'll explain the value of using source control for file management and change tracking so you won't have to lose another report. We'll also introduce some options for designing a deployment strategy to organize your publishing process.

By the end of this module, you'll be able to identify best solutions for source control and deployment strategies for Power BI using a combination of OneDrive, SharePoint, Git, and Azure DevOps.
