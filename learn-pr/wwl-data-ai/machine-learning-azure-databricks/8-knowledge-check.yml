  questions:
  - content: "Which kind of machine learning algorithm would you use to train a model that predicts the amount of rainfall in inches on a given day?"
    choices:
    - content: "Classification"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. A classification model predicts a category or *class*."
    - content: "Regression"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. A regression model predicts a numeric value."
    - content: "Clustering"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. A clustering model groups similar cases into clusters."
  - content: "Which Spark class should you use to explore and cleanse training data for a machine learning project?"
    choices:
    - content: "Dataframe"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. A dataframe is a great class to use for working with data."
    - content: "RDD"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. While you can use an RDD to work with data, it can be complex to program against."
    - content: "Model"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. A model is a predictive function that is trained by a machine learning algorithm."
  - content: "Which of the following metrics would you use to evaluate a classification model?"
    choices:
    - content: "Mean Squared Error"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Mean Squared Error is used to evaluate a regression model."
    - content: "Silhouette"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Silhouette is used to evaluate a clustering model."
    - content: "Recall"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Recall is a metric that is used to evaluate a clustering model."
