  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "You want to train a model that can categorize an image as \"cat\" or \"dog\" based on its subject. What kind of Azure AI Custom Vision project should you create?"
    choices:
    - content: "Image classification (multiclass)"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. To train a model that classifies an image using a single tag, use an Image classification (multiclass) project."
    - content: "Image classification (multilabel)"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. To train a model that classifies an image using a single tag, use an Image classification (multiclass) project."
    - content: "Object detection"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. To train a model that classifies an image using a single tag, use an Image classification (multiclass) project."
  - content: "Which of the following kinds of Azure resource can you use to host a trained Azure AI Custom Vision model?"
    choices:
    - content: "Azure AI Custom Vision (Training)"
