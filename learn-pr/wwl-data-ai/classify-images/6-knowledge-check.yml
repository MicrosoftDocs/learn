  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "What Azure AI Custom Vision resources should you create in Azure to create a custom vision solution?"
    choices:
    - content: "A single Computer Vision resource"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. You can't use an Azure AI Computer Vision resource for custom vision models."
    - content: "A Custom Vision resource for image classification, and another for object detection"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Custom Vision resources aren't specific to image classification and object detection."
    - content: "A Custom Vision resource for training, and another for prediction"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. You need separate Custom Vision resources for training and prediction."
  - content: "You want to train a model that can categorize an image as \"cat\" or \"dog\" based on its subject. What kind of Azure AI Custom Vision project should you create?"
    choices:
    - content: "Image classification (multiclass)"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. To train a model that classifies an image using a single tag, use an Image classification (multiclass) project."
    - content: "Image classification (multilabel)"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. To train a model that classifies an image using a single tag, use an Image classification (multiclass) project."
    - content: "Object detection"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. To train a model that classifies an image using a single tag, use an Image classification (multiclass) project."
  - content: "What information does a client application need to connect to Azure AI Custom Vision and classify an image?"
    choices:
    - content: "The endpoint and key for the Custom Vision training resource"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. You can't generate predictions from the training resource endpoint."
    - content: "The endpoint and key for the Custom Vision prediction resource"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While you *do* need the endpoint and key for the prediction endpoint, you also need some other settings."
    - content: "The endpoint and key for the Custom Vision prediction resource, the project ID for your image classification project, and the name of your deployed model"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. You need all of these values to generate an image classification prediction."
