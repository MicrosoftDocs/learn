title: Implement a non-relational data model
summary: Identify an application’s key access patterns. Define the entities’ data model, along with containers to store the data with a partition key that will result in an efficient and scalable data store for the application.
abstract: |
  In this module, you will:
  * Determine access patterns for data.
  * Apply data model and partitioning strategies to support an efficient and scalable NoSQL database.
prerequisites: |
  * Familiarity with Azure Cosmos DB concepts, like databases, containers, documents, and throughput in Request Units per second (RU/s)
  * Familiarity with using Azure Cosmos DB resources and data in the Azure portal, like using Data Explorer, running queries, and viewing query stats
