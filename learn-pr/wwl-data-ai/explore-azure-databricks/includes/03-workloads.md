Azure Databricks offers capabilities for various workloads including Machine Learning and Large Language Models (LLM), Data Science, Data Engineering, BI and Data Warehousing, and Streaming Processing.

## Data Engineering

Azure Databricks provides capabilities for data scientists and engineers who need to collaborate on complex data processing tasks. It provides an integrated environment with Apache Spark for big data processing in a data lakehouse, and supports multiple languages including Python, R, Scala, and SQL. The platform facilitates data exploration, visualization, and the development of data pipelines.

## SQL

Data analysts who primarily interact with data through SQL can use SQL warehouses in Azure Databricks. The Azure Databricks Workspace UI provides a familiar SQL editor, dashboards, and automatic visualization tools to analyze and visualize data directly within Azure Databricks. This workload is ideal for running quick ad-hoc queries and creating reports from large datasets.
