  questions:
  - content: "What is the first step in using Azure Databricks?"
    choices:
    - content: "Create a Spark Cluster"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Creating a Spark Cluster isn't the first step in using Azure Databricks."
    - content: "Provision an Azure Databricks workspace"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Before you start using Azure Databricks for data analysis, you must first provision an Azure Databricks workspace through the Azure Portal. This workspace serves as the foundational environment for managing clusters, notebooks, and data."
    - content: "Upload data to Azure Blob Storage"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Upload data to Azure Blob Storage isn't the first step in using Azure Databricks."
  - content: "Which Azure Databricks component is responsible for processing data?"
    choices:
    - content: "Workspace"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. In Azure Databricks, a workspace is an environment for accessing all the Databricks assets like notebooks, libraries, and experiments."
    - content: "Notebook"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. In Azure Databricks, notebooks are interactive documents that contain runnable code, visualizations, and narrative text."
    - content: "Cluster"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. In Azure Databricks, a cluster is a set of computation resources where data processing tasks are executed. Clusters can be configured with different node types and sizes depending on the computational needs."
  - content: "What should you do to minimize costs after finishing data analysis tasks in Azure Databricks?"
    choices:
    - content: "Delete the notebook"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Deleting the notebook doesn't minimize the costs."
    - content: "Detach the notebook from the cluster"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Detaching the notebook from the cluster doesn't minimize the costs."
    - content: "Terminate the cluster"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. To minimize costs, it's crucial to terminate the Spark clusters in Azure Databricks when they aren't in use. Clusters consume resources and incur costs as long as they're running, regardless of activity."
