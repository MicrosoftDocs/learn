    - content: "Models can be deployed as containerized services in Microsoft Azure."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While you can deploy a model as a containerized service in Microsoft Azure, it doesn't help mitigate bias."
  - content: "How should you establish a responsible AI governance system?"
    choices:
    - content: "Appoint a Chief Ethics Officer with sole responsibility for devising and enforcing responsible AI principles."

      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. An AI governance plan works best when the focus is on developing tools for compliance rather than complete software restriction."
    - content: "Replace all employee smartphones with secure laptop devices that are capable of running the latest AI models."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A centralized AI inventory of AI models is a better way to optimize resources and prioritize efforts than having each employee manage their own AI models."
