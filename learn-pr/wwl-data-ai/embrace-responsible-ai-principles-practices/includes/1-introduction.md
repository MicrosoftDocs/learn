Whether through third-party AI solutions or their own, organizations are finding the need to create internal policies and practices to guide their AI efforts. 

Microsoft believes that as organizations and as a society, our steps towards responsible AI need to continually evolve to reflect new innovations and lessons from both our mistakes and accomplishments.
