It's important to consider the ethical implications of working with AI systems. Azure OpenAI provides powerful natural language models capable of completing various tasks and operating in several different use cases, each with their own considerations for safe and fair use. Teams or individuals tasked with developing and deploying AI systems should work to identify, measure, and mitigate harm.

Usage of Azure OpenAI should follow the six Microsoft [AI principles](/azure/machine-learning/concept-responsible-ai?azure-portal=true):

- **Fairness**: AI systems shouldn't make decisions that discriminate against or support bias of a group or individual.
- **Reliability and Safety**: AI systems should respond safely to new situations and potential manipulation.
- **Privacy and Security**: AI systems should be secure and respect data privacy.
- **Inclusiveness**: AI systems should empower everyone and engage people.
- **Accountability**: People must be accountable for how AI systems operate.
- **Transparency**: AI systems should have explanations so users can understand how they're built and used.

Responsible AI principles guide [Microsoft's Transparency Notes on Azure OpenAI](/legal/cognitive-services/openai/transparency-note?azure-portal=true), as well as explanations of other products. Transparency Notes are intended to help you understand how Microsoft's AI technology works, the choices system owners can make that influence system performance and behavior, and the importance of thinking about the whole system, including the technology, the people, and the environment.

## Limited access to Azure OpenAI

As part of Microsoft's commitment to using AI responsibly, access to Azure OpenAI is currently limited. Customers that wish to use Azure OpenAI must submit a registration form for both initial experimentation access, and again for approval for use in production.

Additional registration is required for customers who want to modify content filters or modify abuse monitoring settings.
