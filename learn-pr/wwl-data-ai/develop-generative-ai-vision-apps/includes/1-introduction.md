Generative AI models enable you to develop chat-based applications that reason over and respond to input. Often this input takes the form of a text-based prompt, but increasingly multimodal models that can respond to visual input are becoming available.

In this module, we'll discuss vision-enabled generative AI and explore how you can use Azure AI Foundry to create generative AI solutions that respond to prompts that include a mix of text and image data.
