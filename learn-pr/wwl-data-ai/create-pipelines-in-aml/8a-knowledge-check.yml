  questions:
  - content: "You're creating a pipeline that includes two steps. Step 1 preprocesses some data, and step 2 uses the preprocessed data to train a model. What type of object should you use to pass data from step 1 to step 2 and create a dependency between these steps?"
    choices:
    - content: "Datastore"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That is incorrect. To pass data between steps in a pipeline, use an OutputFileDatasetConfig object."
    - content: "OutputFileDatasetConfig"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That is correct. To pass data between steps in a pipeline, use an OutputFileDatasetConfig object."
    - content: "Dataset"

      explanation: "That is incorrect. To pass data between steps in a pipeline, use an OutputFileDatasetConfig object."
  - content: "You've published a pipeline that you want to run every week. You plan to use the Schedule.create method to create the schedule. What kind of object must you create first to configure how frequently the pipeline runs?"
    choices:
    - content: "Datastore"
      isCorrect: false
