The **Microsoft Assessment and Planning (MAP)** toolkit is an agentless inventory, assessment, and reporting tool that analyzes your IT environment. This toolkit returns a report with information that can be exported to Excel.

Suppose you've been hired as database administrator for an international company that has SQL Server instances located across the globe. The outgoing DBA gave you a list of server names and logins in a spreadsheet. You don't have detailed or up-to-date information about these servers. You know you should take an inventory of the version, edition, service packs, installed components, and underlying hardware for each SQL Server instance.

You begin by connecting to each server, but this manual process takes too long. You're repeating the same tasks each time. Also, you realize you'll need to repeat this exercise on a regular basis. Repeating inventorying will provide up-to-date information in line with the hardware upgrades the operations teams undertake and changes you apply to SQL Server.

You want to automate this process, because some of the SQL Servers you've already discovered need to be upgraded. The method needs repeating to maintain a current inventory.

In this module, you'll learn how to use the Microsoft Assessment and Planning toolkit to audit your database landscape and how to repeat this process in future.
