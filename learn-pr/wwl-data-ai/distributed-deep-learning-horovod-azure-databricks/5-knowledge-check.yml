quiz:
  questions:
  - content: "To use HorovodRunner, we have to set the number of processes by specifying the parameter `np`. What should the value for `np` be if we want to train on a single node?"
    choices:
    - content: "`np=2`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This uses a cluster with two workers."
    - content: "`np=-1`"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. This will train the model using a single process on the driver node."
    - content: "`np=1`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This uses a cluster with one driver and one worker."
  - content: "In the Horovod training script, what is the primary purpose of hvd.callbacks.BroadcastGlobalVariablesCallback(0) callback?"
    choices:
    - content: "To ensure consistent initialization of all workers when training is started with random weights or restored from a checkpoint."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. It is important to start all workers with the same initial state."
    - content: "To average metrics among workers at the end of every epoch."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The correct callback to average metrics among workers at the end of every epoch is hvd.callbacks.MetricAverageCallback()."
    - content: "Reduce the learning rate if training plateaus."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The correct callback to reduce the learning rate if training plateaus is ReduceLROnPlateau(patience=…)."
