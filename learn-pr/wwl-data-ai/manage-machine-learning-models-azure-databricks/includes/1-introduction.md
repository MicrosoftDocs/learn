Training a great model is a start to a data science project, but having a trained model that existed in a notebook on a cluster at one point in time will not be enough. To move beyond this phase, you can use model management. In this module, you will learn how you can use MLflow in Azure Databricks to register and manage your models. 

## Learning objectives

After completing this module, you'll be able to:

- Describe considerations for model management.
- Register models.
- Manage model versioning.
