  - content: "How do you share throughput between containers?"
    choices:
    - content: "Specify database throughput."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "By specifying throughput at the database level, the throughput is shared between the containers."
    - content: "Specify container throughput."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "By specifying throughput at the database level, the throughput is shared between the containers."
    - content: "Specify logical partition throughput."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "By specifying throughput at the database level, the throughput is shared between the containers."
  - content: "You have decided to distribute your database over multiple regions to decrease latency for users. What is the effect of the availability SLA?"
    choices:
    - content: "It remains at 99.99%."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "If your database is in a single region there is a Service Level Agreement (SLA) for the database to be available for 99.99% of the time, but, if you deploy to multiple regions, you benefit from an SLA of 99.999% read and write availability."
    - content: "It increases to 99.999%."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "If your database is in a single region there is a Service Level Agreement (SLA) for the database to be available for 99.99% of the time, but, if you deploy to multiple regions, you benefit from an SLA of 99.999% read and write availability."
    - content: "It increass to 99.9999%"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "If your database is in a single region there is a Service Level Agreement (SLA) for the database to be available for 99.99% of the time, but, if you deploy to multiple regions, you benefit from an SLA of 99.999% read and write availability."
  - content: "You need specific connection strings for your applications, so that they use your security protocols. Where can you find this information?"
    choices:
    - content: "In your Cosmos DB account, in **Overview**."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "For more options than the quick start settings, in **Settings**, select **Connection String**. You can then provide security information and receive a specific connection string for your settings."
    - content: "In your Cosmos DB account, in **Settings**, and then **Network**."

      explanation: "For more options than the quick start settings, in **Settings**, select **Connection String**. You can then provide security information and receive a specific connection string for your settings."
  - content: "You have all your users in one region and need to maximize availability. How should you achieve this?"
    choices:
    - content: "Replicate data to at least two regions."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "To improve availability, you should consider having data in at least two regions even if all of your users are in one location"
    - content: "Have a single copy of your data and premium level backups."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "To improve availability, you should consider having data in at least two regions even if all of your users are in one location"
    - content: "Replicate data within your region."
      isCorrect: false
