  questions:
  - content: "You've trained a model using the Python SDK for Azure Machine Learning. You want to deploy the model as a containerized real-time service with high scalability and security. What kind of compute should you create to host the service?"
    choices:
    - content: "An Azure Kubernetes Services (AKS) inferencing cluster"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That is correct. You should use an AKS cluster to deploy a model as a scalable, secure, containerized service."
    - content: "A compute instance with GPUs"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That is incorrect. You should use an AKS cluster to deploy a model as a scalable, secure, containerized service."
    - content: "A training cluster with multiple nodes."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That is incorrect. You should use an AKS cluster to deploy a model as a scalable, secure, containerized service."
  - content: "You're deploying a model as a real-time inferencing service. What functions must the entry script for the service include?"
    choices:
    - content: "main() and score()"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That is incorrect. You must implement init and run functions in the entry (scoring) script."
    - content: "base() and train()"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That is incorrect. You must implement init and run functions in the entry (scoring) script."
    - content: "init() and run()"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That is correct. You must implement init and run functions in the entry (scoring) script."
