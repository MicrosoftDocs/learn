In this module, you learned how to use Azure AI Search to create a *knowledge store* in which to persist enriched data extracted from your data sources by the indexing process. Knowledge stores can contain data in three kinds of *projection*:

- *Object* projections are JSON representations of the indexed documents.
- *File* projections are JPEG files containing image data extracted from documents.
- *Table* projections create a relational schema for the extracted data.

For more information about Azure AI Search, take a look at the [service documentation](/azure/search/).
