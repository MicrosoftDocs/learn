  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "What is the most efficient approach for data transformation when designing data models for scalability?"
    choices:
    - content: "Data transformation should always be done using Power Query in Power BI."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Data transformation in Power Query might be the best option if you don't have access to the source system. It isn't always the best location for transformation."
    - content: "Data transformation should be done as close to the source as possible, before reaching Power BI."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. When you're considering scalability and large data, transformation should be done as close to the source as possible. This will enable reduced processing during data import in Power BI."
    - content: "Data transformation should be done using DAX, after data is ingested and loaded to the model."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. DAX isn't the most efficient approach for data transformation."
  - content: "Which of the following best practices for Power BI data modeling is relevant only to DirectQuery models?"
    choices:
    - content: "Set relationships to enforce integrity using the assume referential integrity property on relationships."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Setting the assume referential integrity setting on relationships enables more efficient queries against your data source in DirectQuery."
    - content: "Use a star schema as opposed to wide tables."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The use of a star schema isn't only relevant to DirectQuery models."
    - content: "Disable auto date/time in Power BI Desktop."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Disabling auto date/time isn't only relevant to DirectQuery models."
  - content: "What are the data model size limits on a dataset with large dataset storage format determined by?"
    choices:
    - content: "Power BI Premium 10 GB size limit."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Dataset caches in Power BI Premium are limited to 10 GB after compression if the large dataset storage format isn't enabled."
    - content: "Power BI Premium capacity size or the maximum size set by the administrator."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. When enabled, dataset size is limited by the Premium capacity size or the maximum size set by the administrator."
    - content: "There are no size limits if large dataset storage format is enabled."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. There are still limits on the size of the data model."
