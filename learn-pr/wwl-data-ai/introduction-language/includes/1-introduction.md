In order for computer systems to interpret the subject of a text in a similar way humans do, they use **natural language processing** (NLP), an area within AI that deals with understanding written or spoken language, and responding in kind. *Text analysis* describes NLP processes that extract information from unstructured text.   

Natural language processing might be used to create:

- A social media feed analyzer that detects sentiment for a product marketing campaign. 
- A document search application that summarizes documents in a catalog.
- An application that extracts brands and company names from text.

In this module, let's explore natural language processing.
