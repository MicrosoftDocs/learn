  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "What is the primary purpose of tokenization in natural language processing (NLP)?"
    choices:
    - content: "To translate text into another language."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect."
    - content: "To summarize large documents."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect."
    - content: "To break down text into smaller units for analysis."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct."
  - content: "Which of the following techniques is used to determine the importance of words in a document within the context of a larger collection of documents?"
    choices:
    - content: "Naïve Bayes"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Naïve Bayes calculates the probability of a document belonging to a particular class based on the probabilities of individual words given that class."
    - content: "TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. TF-IDF is a technique used to determine the importance of words in a document within the context of a larger collection of documents."
    - content: " Word2Vec"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Word2Vec is a technique for generating word embeddings, which are dense vector representations of words that capture semantic relationships between words. "
  - content: "Which of the following best describes the role of embeddings in natural language processing (NLP)?"
    choices:
      - content: "They visualize text data in two-dimensional space for easier interpretation."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect."
      - content: "They summarize large text corpora into short, meaningful sentences." 
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect."
      - content: "They convert language tokens into vectors that capture semantic relationships."
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "Correct."
