Azure SQL Database provides an industry-leading Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) implementation of Microsoft SQL Server in the Azure cloud. If you want to migrate from an on-premises database to Azure SQL Database, you must plan carefully to ensure that the project runs smoothly.

Suppose you work for a company that builds bikes and bicycle parts. You have several legacy database servers that you want to upgrade, including and product database, a parts stock database, and a human resources database. You also want to move from a capital expenditure model to an operational expenditure model, and benefit from the scalability and availability of the cloud. You plan to migrate your servers to Azure SQL Database. Your board of directors has asked you to plan the migration project and has made you responsible for the smooth delivery of the working Azure SQL Database system.

In this module, you'll look at how to migrate SQL Server workloads to Azure SQL Database. You'll begin by exploring the pre-migration considerations you need to take into account before a migration, and how to create an Azure SQL Database. You'll then explore the different methods for offline and online migrations, and look at how to ensure service continuity of Azure SQL Database.

By the end of this module, you'll be able to plan a migration to Azure SQL Database confidently and run a migration project smoothly.
