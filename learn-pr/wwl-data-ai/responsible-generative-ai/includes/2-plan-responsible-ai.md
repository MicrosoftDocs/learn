The Microsoft guidance for responsible generative AI is designed to be practical and actionable. It defines a four stage process to develop and implement a plan for responsible AI when using generative models. The four stages in the process are:

1. *Identify* potential harms that are relevant to your planned solution.
1. *Measure* the presence of these harms in the outputs generated by your solution.
1. *Mitigate* the harms at multiple layers in your solution to minimize their presence and impact, and ensure transparent communication about potential risks to users.
1. *Operate* the solution responsibly by defining and following a deployment and operational readiness plan.

>[!NOTE]
> These stages correspond closely to the functions in the [NIST AI Risk Management Framework](https://www.nist.gov/itl/ai-risk-management-framework).

The remainder of this module discusses each of these stages in detail, providing suggestions for actions you can take to implement a successful and responsible generative AI solution.
