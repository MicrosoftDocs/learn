Generative AI is one of the most powerful advances in technology ever. It enables developers to build applications that consume machine learning models trained with a large volume of data from across the Internet to generate new content that can be indistinguishable from content created by a human.

With such powerful capabilities, generative AI brings with it some dangers; and requires that data scientists, developers, and others involved in creating generative AI solutions adopt a responsible approach that identifies, measures, and mitigates risks.

The module explores a set of guidelines for responsible generative AI that has been defined by experts at Microsoft. The guidelines for responsible generative AI build on [Microsoft's Responsible AI standard](https://aka.ms/RAI) to account for specific considerations related to generative AI models.
