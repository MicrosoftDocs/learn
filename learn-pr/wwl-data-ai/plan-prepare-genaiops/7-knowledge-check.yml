  questions:
  - content: "Which of the following best describes GenAIOps?"
    choices:
    - content: "GenAIOps is a term used to describe the study of language linguistics and machine operations."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. GenAIOps doesn't refer to the study of language linguistics and machine operations, but rather to the operational aspects of deploying and maintaining large language models."
    - content: "GenAIOps focuses primarily on the development of hardware designed for training large language models."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. While hardware development is important, GenAIOps encompasses a broader scope including practices and tools for optimizing, deploying, and maintaining LLMs-based applications."
    - content: "GenAIOps refers to a set of practices and tools specifically for optimizing, deploying, and maintaining LLMs-based applications."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. GenAIOps involves the practices and tools that support the lifecycle of large language models, from optimization and deployment to maintenance and updates."
  - content: "What is Prompty?"
    choices:
    - content: "Prompty is a language agnostic prompt asset class and format for creating prompts and engineering the responses."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Prompty allows for the creation and engineering of prompts in a format that isn't dependent on any specific language, enabling a wide range of applications."
    - content: "Prompty is a programming language created for writing machine learning algorithms."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Prompty isn't a programming language, but rather a format for creating and managing prompts used with large language models."
    - content: "Prompty is a development tool to create executable flows that link LLMs, prompts, and Python tools through a user-friendly UI."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While Prompty facilitates the use of prompts with LLMs, it isn't a tool for creating executable flows or linking Python tools through a UI."
  - content: "What azd cli command should you use to create all the project resources and deploy the app to Azure?"
    choices:
    - content: "`azd up`"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The `azd up` command is used to create all the necessary resources and deploy the application to Azure, streamlining the process into a single step."
    - content: "`azd deploy`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While `azd deploy` is used for deployment, it doesn't create all the project resources."
    - content: "`azd auth login`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The `azd auth login` command is used to authenticate with Azure, not to create resources or deploy applications."
