**Generative Artificial Intelligence** (**GenAI**) applications are transforming the user experience and accelerating adoption of AI tools and solution across consumer and enterprise domains.

Traditional Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications focused on building and deploying machine learning models **from scratch**. Traditional machine learning models were trained on custom datasets with the goal of **generating predictions** that supported decision-making.

Generative AI applications focus on **pretrained language models** based on massive internet-scale text data. These models can be augmented with data (RAG) or **fine-tuned** to execute tasks with the goal of **generating content** in response to user queries or instructions. A generative AI application can focus on text generation like question-answering, text summarization, or translation. Or rich content generation driven by text-based instructions like creating images, audio, video, or code.

The key difference lies in the **use of natural language constructs** as text-based inputs, also known as **prompts**, with **token-based processing**, or completions, that generate stochastic outputs that can vary based on different factors including input prompt, system context, model parameters, and more.

The emergence of generative AI applications is leading to a **paradigm shift** for end-to-end development, where the developer focus shifts from **model generation** (traditional MLOps) to **content generation** using pretrained models (modern GenAIOps).

To build effective GenAI solutions, developers need to select the right models, and also understand how these models fit into the broader operational framework to develop an application. The end-to-end application development of a GenAI solution is also referred to as **Large Language Model Operations** (**LLMOps**), or **GenAI Operations** (**GenAIOps**).

Before going into the technical aspect of preparing a GenAIOps solution, you learn to plan an appropriate use case by exploring various examples and their architectures.
