In the early years of computing systems, every application stored data in its own unique structure. When developers wanted to build applications to use that data, they had to know a lot about the particular data structure to find the data they needed. These data structures were inefficient, hard to maintain, and hard to optimize for good application performance. The *relational* database model was designed to solve the problem of multiple arbitrary data structures. The relational model provides a standard way of representing and querying data that can be used by any application. One of the key advantages of the relational database model is its use of *tables*, which are an intuitive, efficient, and flexible way to store and access structured information.

The simple yet powerful relational model is used by organizations of all types and sizes for a broad variety of information management needs. Relational databases are used to track inventories, process ecommerce transactions, manage huge amounts of mission-critical customer information, and much more. A relational database is useful for storing any information containing related data elements that must be organized in a rules-based, consistent structure.

In this module, you'll learn about the key characteristics of relational databases, and explore relational data structures.
