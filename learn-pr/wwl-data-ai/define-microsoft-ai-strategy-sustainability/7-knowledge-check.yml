  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "What is the biggest challenge in AI systems for sustainability and how can organizations deal with it?"
    choices:
    - content: "AI systems aren't suited to sustainability scenarios. You should use manual efforts to address sustainability use cases."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. AI systems can be powerful aids in sustainability scenarios."
    - content: "Sustainability scenarios often require highly technical expertise on climate science, ecology, and so on. You should focus on automating less technical tasks."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. AI can be helpful in all sorts of scenarios, even those requiring technical expertise, such as identifying wildlife species or estimating how much pesticide your crop needs."
    - content: "AI systems are themselves consumers of energy. They must be optimized to be efficient and powered by sustainable energy sources if possible."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. A bad design can make an AI sustainability solution waste too much energy. Remember that Microsoft Azure has features to minimize energy consumption with optimal performance."
  - content: "How might AI be best used to address challenges in agriculture?"
    choices:
    - content: "Analyzing environmental conditions and optimizing energy and water consumption."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. AI can help optimize energy and water consumption by analyzing environmental conditions."
    - content: "Generating images of plants."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. AI generated plant images do not solve agricultural challenges."
    - content: "AI is not useful in agricultural scenarios."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Data-based decision making can substantially improve farming productivity and sustainability."
  - content: "How might AI be best used to address challenges in wildlife conservation?"
    choices:
    - content: "Predicting stock prices and exchange rates."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Financial prediction is not a relevant challenge in wildlife conservation."
    - content: "Using computer vision to identify endangered species."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Identifying species can be very time consuming, but AI systems can automatically detect and classify animals."
    - content: "AI is not useful in wildlife conservation scenarios."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. AI can be used to monitor and map wildlife populations."
