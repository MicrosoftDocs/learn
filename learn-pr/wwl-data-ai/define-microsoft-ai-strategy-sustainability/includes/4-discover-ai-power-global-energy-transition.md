The energy sector is one of the key actors in the journey towards a greener future. EDP provides a good example of how energy organizations can embrace AI to deliver renewable energy.

## The organization

**EDP** is a Portuguese electricity and natural gas company. Today, 87 percent of the electricity they generate is green. After 40 years of experience in the sector, it’s now one of the largest renewable energy providers in the world, as it serves more than nine million clients in 29 markets.

In 2016, their goal to become a data-driven organization led them to migrate to Microsoft Azure. Now, their focus is to adopt AI and IoT technology.

## The challenge

EDP is working hard to build a decarbonized, less polluted world. Their objective isn't only to reinforce their leading position in the renewable energy market, but also set an example and support customers to move towards decarbonization.

Related to this goal, EDP commits to produce **100 percent renewable energy by 2030** and to become **net zero by 2040**. To keep these impressive promises, they rely on Microsoft AI and IoT to help them with several projects.

## The solution

The organization developed several AI and IoT solutions based on Azure Machine Learning and Azure AI Services, focusing on generative AI in **Azure OpenAI Service**.

* **Installation of electric chargers**: EDP is using geographical data, customer demand, road information, and other insights to detect the best places to install electric chargers on public roads. This project aims to encourage electric vehicles and green mobility.
* **Proactive power lines maintenance**: Vegetation can easily obstruct aerial power lines. The Analytics4Vegetation project ensures the maintenance of such power lines in Portugal. It detects vegetation and identifies which power lines potentially need maintenance. Furthermore, it helps maintenance management by predicting optimal time until new maintenance action in the area.
* **Power transformers**: There are more than 100,000 power transformers in Portugal. EDP is using Azure Machine Learning to predict their power curve, ensuring optimal efficiency.
* **Data and AI strategy and governance plan**: EDP is implementing a full strategy and governance plan for their data and AI to back their AI initiatives and embrace corporate AI culture.
* **Generative AI adoption**: The organization is committed to implementing generative AI. They’re accelerating their adoption across all business units to generate business value.
* **Training and upskilling on AI for business**: Effective AI adoption relies on empowering employees to incorporate AI into their routines. For this purpose, EDP is using Microsoft training materials on AI for business, such as [Transform your business with Microsoft AI](/training/paths/transform-your-business-with-microsoft-ai/).

## The results

Now, the staff in EDP reports they feel more **inspired to innovate**. The organization is providing the tools and support required to experiment with AI and transform the way they do business.

Above all, the organization is achieving its **energy transition goals** thanks to these AI initiatives. Furthermore, it’s also gaining resilience to move forward in this transition journey.

Next, let’s discuss another sustainability success story, this time focused on protecting natural resources.
