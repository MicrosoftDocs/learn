The world needs sustainability solutions to build a better future. We must rethink the way we approach many industrial processes to ensure they’re energetically efficient, reduce pollution and waste, and so on. This task involves many sectors, such as farming, manufacturing, land management, and mobility. This module illustrates with real examples that leading organizations are using AI to boost their sustainability initiatives.

Microsoft offers a wide range of AI products and services to enable these sustainability scenarios. Microsoft Cloud for Sustainability is tailored to the sector’s needs, but you can also use Azure Machine Learning and Azure AI Services, among others. The latest generative AI models are also available via Azure OpenAI Services.

Now that you have reviewed this module, you should:

* Identify AI use cases in sustainability.
* Examine available AI tools and resources for sustainability scenarios.
* Discover insights from sustainability-specific AI success stories.
