  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "What does an object detection model predict?"
    choices:
    - content: "The location and class of specific classes of object in an image."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Object detection is used to identify bounding boxes containing specific classes of object in an image."
    - content: "The class of the main subject of an image."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Object detection is used to identify bounding boxes containing specific classes of object in an image."
    - content: "The file type of an image."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Object detection is used to identify bounding boxes containing specific classes of object in an image."
  - content: "What must you do before taking advantage of the smart labeler tool when creating an object detection model?"
    choices:
    - content: "Create a JSON file containing bounding box coordinates."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. To take advantage of the smart labeler, tag some images and train an initial model. Subsequently, the portal will suggest tags for new images."
    - content: "Tag some images with objects of each class and train an initial object detection model."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. To take advantage of the smart labeler, tag some images and train an initial model. Subsequently, the portal will suggest tags for new images."
    - content: "Train an image classification (multilabel) model."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. To take advantage of the smart labeler, tag some images and train an initial model. Subsequently, the portal will suggest tags for new images."
