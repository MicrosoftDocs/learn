quiz:
  questions:
  - content: "What is the main difference between monitoring and tracing in generative AI applications?"
    choices:
    - content: "Monitoring alerts you when something goes wrong, while tracing helps you understand what happened and where it happened."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Monitoring tells you that issues exist, but tracing provides the detailed flow of execution to help you understand the root cause."
    - content: "Monitoring is for production environments, while tracing is only for development."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Both monitoring and tracing are valuable throughout the entire lifecycle: development, deployment, and post-deployment."
    - content: "Monitoring tracks performance metrics, while tracing only captures errors."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Tracing captures both successful operations and errors, providing insights into the complete flow of execution."
  - content: "In OpenTelemetry tracing, what represents a specific unit of work or operation within a trace?"
    choices:
    - content: "Attribute"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Attributes are metadata associated with spans that provide extra details about operations."
    - content: "Span"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. A span represents a single operation within a trace, such as an HTTP request or model inference call, and includes timing information."
    - content: "Trace"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A trace represents the entire journey of a request from start to finish and encompasses multiple spans."
  - content: "Which Python packages are required to implement tracing in Azure AI Foundry applications?"
    choices:
    - content: "`azure-ai-projects`, `azure-monitor-opentelemetry`, and `opentelemetry-instrumentation-openai-v2`"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. These packages provide project connectivity, Azure Application Insights integration, and automatic OpenAI SDK tracing."
    - content: "`azure-ai-inference`, `azure-monitor`, and `opentelemetry-sdk`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While these packages are valid Azure packages, they don't provide the specific tracing capabilities needed for AI applications."
    - content: "`azure-openai`, `azure-monitor-opentelemetry`, and `opentelemetry-api`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This combination lacks the `azure-ai-projects` package needed for Azure AI Foundry integration."
