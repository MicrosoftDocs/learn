  questions:
  - content: "What serves as the foundation of continuous monitoring for generative AI applications?"
    choices:
    - content: "Online Evaluation"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Online Evaluations is an extension of tracing."
    - content: "Tracing"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Tracing captures the core telemetry data that enables all other monitoring and evaluation."
    - content: "Application Insights "
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Application Insights displays trace data but does not generate it."
  - content: "What does Azure AI Online Evaluation help assess in real time?"
    choices:
    - content: "The latency of AI responses."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Latency is measured through tracing, not online evaluation."
    - content: "The quality of AI-generated outputs."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Online evaluation assesses response quality, safety, and relevance in real-time."
    - content: "The token cost of model deployments."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Token usage is tracked via tracing, not part of Online Evaluations."
  - content: "Which component provides advanced observability tools including custom dashboards and configurable alerting mechanisms?"
    choices:
    - content: "Azure Monitor"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Azure Monitor provides dashboards, alerts, and analytics for end-to-end observability."
    - content: "Azure AI Inference SDK"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The Inference SDK is used to run model operations, not for monitoring or observability."
    - content: "Azure AI Foundry SDK"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The Azure AI Foundry SDK manages projects and deployments but doesn’t offer observability tools."
