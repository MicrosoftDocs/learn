abstract: |
  By the end of this module, you'll be able to:
    - Distinguish between monitoring and tracing in generative AI applications.
    - Identify key tracing concepts: traces, spans, and attributes in OpenTelemetry.
    - Set up tracing infrastructure with Azure AI Foundry and Application Insights.
    - Implement custom spans for AI model calls and business logic operations.
    - Handle complex workflows with structured data generation and error handling.
    - Analyze trace data to identify performance bottlenecks and failure patterns.
    - Apply production best practices for effective observability.
prerequisites: |
