Imagine you're working at Lakeshore Retail, and you launched the Trail Guide AI assistant. Trail Guide helps customers plan their hiking trips and finds the appropriate outdoor gear in your web shop.

Everything seems to be running smoothly until you start noticing some issues: the AI assistant sometimes gives confusing answers, like recommending winter gear for a summer hike or suggesting routes that are too advanced for beginners. How can you find out what is going wrong and how to fix it?

## Compare monitoring and tracing

Monitoring and tracing are connected and both key components of **observability**, which is the practice of understanding the internal state of a system based on the data it produces.

**Monitoring** tells you that requests are reaching the endpoint and responses are being sent back, but it doesn't explain *why* these issues are happening. From a monitoring perspective, Trail Guide shows no issues, but your users are complaining.

**Tracing** goes beyond monitoring by allowing you to follow the flow of execution within your application. While monitoring alerts you to issues when they occur, tracing helps you uncover the underlying causes of those problems.

## Why is tracing important?

Generative AI applications typically involve multiple steps and components, each with dependencies on the other. You have things like data preprocessing, model execution, post-processing, and even integration with other systems. These steps don’t always work in a linear fashion. Tracing helps you:

- **Understand how different parts of the system interact**, giving you a clear picture of how data flows through each step.
- **Identify bottlenecks or failures**. When an issue arises, tracing can highlight where exactly things are going wrong.

## When do you use tracing?

As an AI engineer, your job is to make sure that AI systems run efficiently and reliably at scale. Tracing fits into the lifecycle of your AI operations by helping you manage and debug complex AI workflows more effectively.

- **During development**, tracing provides insights into your model’s internals, helping you tune it to perform better.
- **During deployment and scaling**, tracing ensures that everything is running smoothly, helping you catch any problems early and providing insights for optimization.
- **Post-deployment**, tracing continues to monitor how inputs and outputs are handled, so you can maintain reliability as the system evolves.

In essence, tracing is the bridge between monitoring and deep optimization. You can use it to diagnose issues and improve performance, making it a useful tool for anyone working with complex, generative AI models.

Next, let's explore what information you can analyze when you use tracing.
