In the early stages of working with generative AI, it's common to focus on getting something that works. Whether it's a demo, a prototype, or a proof-of-concept. These milestones can all feel significant. However, making something production-ready is a different challenge.

Without proper monitoring, even seemingly stable generative AI applications can face issues in real-world conditions:

- Latency can become unpredictable.
- Costs can increase due to inefficient prompt design or scaling.
- Compute resources aren't aligned with actual usage needs.

Many teams fall into the trap of deploying without fully understanding how their system performs under real conditions. Monitoring transforms guesswork into engineering.

## Understand the use case

Imagine you work for Lakeshore Retail, which sells outdoor gear. The customer support team fields hundreds of inquiries daily about your extensive product lineup, ranging from camping gear to specialized hiking equipment. To enhance response speed and accuracy, they deployed an AI assistant named Trail Guide.

However, deploying a generative AI solution is just the beginning. As an AI engineer, you're asked to implement ongoing monitoring to maintain quality, mitigate risk and safety, and ensure customer satisfaction.

In this module, you learn best practices for monitoring generative AI applications with Azure AI and Azure Monitor. By the end, you're able to proactively monitor AI agents and assistants like Trail Guide and optimize their real-world effectiveness.
