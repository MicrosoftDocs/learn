  questions:
  - content: "A data scientist wants to create multiple pipelines quickly to test different algorithms. A machine learning engineer as created components for such pipelines. What is the preferred method for the data scientist to save time when testing component-based pipelines?"
    choices:
    - content: "Using the Azure Machine Learning CLI (v2)."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Creating a pipeline job YAML file may be a time-consuming and complex task and is not ideal for quick experimentation."
    - content: "Using the Azure Machine Learning designer."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Using the UI, a user can quickly drag and drop different components to the pipeline."
    - content: "Using the Azure Machine Learning workspace."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "A data scientist can create a pipeline with the CLI (v2) or designer, both options connect with the workspace."
  - content: "What prefix should you use when you want to use the pipeline's inputs for a component input in the pipeline's YAML file?"
    choices:
    - content: "`jobs.`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Use when you want to use the output of another component."
    - content: "`outputs.`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Details the pipeline's output."
    - content: "`inputs.`"
