  questions:
  - content: "Which Azure CLI command will create a new Azure Cosmos DB account using the NoSQL API?"
    choices:
    - content: "``az cosmosdb create``"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. The ``az cosmosdb create`` command will create a NoSQL API account by default."
    - content: "``az cosmosdb sql create``"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The ``az cosmosdb sql`` command group does not have a ``create`` command/verb."
    - content: "``az cosmosdb create --api sql``"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The ``az cosmosdb create`` command does not have an ``--api`` argument."
  - content: "Which Azure CLI command will change the maximum amount of throughput for a container using autoscale throughput?"
    choices:
    - content: "``az cosmosdb sql container throughput migrate --throughput-type``"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The **migrate** command changes the method of throughput provisioning for a container based on the value of the **--throughput-type** parameter."
    - content: "``az cosmosdb sql container throughput update --throughput``"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The **update** command with the **--throughput** argument changes the manually provisioned throughput amount for a container."
    - content: "``az cosmosdb sql container throughput update --max-throughput``"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. The **update** command with the **--max-throughput** argument changes the maximum amount of throughput for a container."
  - content: "How can you initiate a manual failover to another region in your Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL account?"
    choices:
    - content: "Use the ``az cosmosdb failover-priority-change --failover-policies`` command to change the priority of any region."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. You must specifically change the priority of the primary region to cause a manual failover event."
    - content: "Use the ``az cosmosdb failover-priority-change --failover-policies`` command ensuring that you specifically change the priority of the region with a priority **= 0**."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Changing the priority of the primary region will cause a manual failover event."
    - content: "Use the ``az cosmosdb update`` command to \"bounce\" the service"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This command changes only the characteristics of the service without affecting a manual failover event."
