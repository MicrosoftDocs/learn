The Azure CLI is a suite of commands used to administratively manage Azure resources across various platforms and operating systems. The Azure CLI ships with a set of commands tailored specifically to manage Azure Cosmos DB resources. These commands cover the most common administrative scenarios for Azure Cosmos DB accounts, and any underlying resources.

> [!NOTE]
> Beyond what ships with the Azure CLI, the Azure Cosmos DB team is constantly producing new commands that are available as Azure CLI extensions that can be installed when they are needed. We will focus on core commands that ship with the CLI.
