While the Azure AI Speech SDK enables you to submit plain text to be synthesized into speech, the service also supports an XML-based syntax for describing characteristics of the speech you want to generate. This **Speech Synthesis Markup Language** (SSML) syntax offers greater control over how the spoken output sounds, enabling you to:

- Specify a speaking style, such as "excited" or "cheerful" when using a neural voice.
- Insert pauses or silence.
- Specify *phonemes* (phonetic pronunciations), for example to pronounce the text "SQL" as "sequel".
- Adjust the *prosody* of the voice (affecting the pitch, timbre, and speaking rate).
- Use common "say-as" rules, for example to specify that a given string should be expressed as a date, time, telephone number, or other form.
- Insert recorded speech or audio, for example to include a standard recorded message or simulate background noise.

For example, consider the following SSML:

```xml
<speak version="1.0" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2001/10/synthesis" 
                     xmlns:mstts="https://www.w3.org/2001/mstts" xml:lang="en-US"> 
    <voice name="en-US-AriaNeural"> 
        <mstts:express-as style="cheerful"> 
          I say tomato 
        </mstts:express-as> 
    </voice> 
    <voice name="en-US-GuyNeural"> 
        I say <phoneme alphabet="sapi" ph="t ao m ae t ow"> tomato </phoneme>. 
        <break strength="weak"/>Lets call the whole thing off! 
    </voice> 
</speak>
```

This SSML specifies a spoken dialog between two different neural voices, like this:

- **Ariana** (*cheerfully*): "I say tomato:
- **Guy**: "I say tomato (pronounced *tom-ah-toe*) ... Let's call the whole thing off!"

To submit an SSML description to the Speech service, you can use an appropriate method of a **SpeechSynthesizer** object, like this:

```python
speech_synthesizer.speak_ssml('<speak>...');
```

For more information about SSML, see the [Azure AI Speech SDK documentation](/azure/ai-services/speech-service/speech-synthesis-markup).
