Before you can use Azure AI Speech, you need to create an Azure AI Speech resource in your Azure subscription. You can use either a dedicated Azure AI Speech resource or a multi-service Azure AI Services resource.

After you create your resource, you'll need the following information to use it from a client application through one of the supported SDKs:

- The *location* in which the resource is deployed (for example, *eastus*)
- One of the *keys* assigned to your resource.

You can view of these values on the **Keys and Endpoint** page for your resource in the Azure portal.
