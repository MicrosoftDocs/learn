In order for computer systems to interpret the subject of a text in a similar way humans do, they use **natural language processing** (NLP), an area within AI that deals with understanding written or spoken language, and responding in kind. *Text analysis* describes NLP processes that extract information from unstructured text.   

Natural language processing might be used to create:

- A social media feed analyzer that detects sentiment for a product marketing campaign. 
- A document search application that summarizes documents in a catalog.
- An application that extracts brands and company names from text.

**Azure AI Language** is a cloud-based service that includes features for understanding and analyzing text. Azure AI Language includes various features that support sentiment analysis, key phrase identification, text summarization, and conversational language understanding.

In this module, you'll explore the capabilities of text analytics, and how you might use them.
