  questions:
  - content: "What does AutoML do?"
    choices:
    - content: "Trains a model based on data you specify using multiple algorithms and hyperparameters to find the best model."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. AutoML tries multiple training combinations to find the optimal model for your data."
    - content: "Runs model training scripts based on a schedule you specify to automate machine learning operations."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. AutoML does not run scripts on a schedule."
    - content: "Trains and deploys machine learning models for use in self-driving vehicles."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. AutoML does not create specialized models for self-driving vehicles."
  - content: "You plan to use AutoML in the Azure Databricks user interface. What should you do first?"
    choices:
    - content: "Train a reference model by using the Spark MLlib library."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A reference model is not required for AutoML."
    - content: "Load the training data into a table in your Azure Databricks workspace."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. You should provide the training data as a table in the Hive metastore."
    - content: "Create a blank notebook."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. You do not need to create a notebook to run AutoML in the user interface."
  - content: "You want to use the AutoML API to train a model that predicts the expected price of a home based on the size, number of bedrooms, and postal code? What method should you use?"
    choices:
    - content: "`classify`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Classification models predict a class or category."
    - content: "`regress`"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. A regression model predicts a numeric value."
    - content: "`forecast`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A forecast model predicts values based on time."
