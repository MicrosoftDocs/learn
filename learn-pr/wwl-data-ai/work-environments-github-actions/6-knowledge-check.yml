quiz:
  questions:
  - content: "An organization uses three environments in their machine learning operations strategy. Which environment is best suited for quality assurance?"
    choices:
    - content: "Development"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Quality assurance is not yet needed during model development."
    - content: "Staging"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Quality assurance is a crucial aspect during staging."
    - content: "Production"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. When a model reaches production, quality assurance already needs to be performed."
  - content: "What may be a reason to add an approval for an environment when using GitHub Actions?"
    choices:
    - content: "Someone needs to verify the code and model before the model moves to the next environment."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Though the code and model should be verified, this should be part of creating and discussing a pull request."
    - content: "Someone needs to verify whether all runs and tests have executed successfully before moving the model to the next environment."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Even when GitHub Actions workflows ran successfully, someone may still need to review the output in the Azure Machine Learning workspace."
    - content: "Someone needs to deploy and test the model before moving the model to the next environment."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Deployment and testing can be automated. Manual approval should be used for tasks that require a human-in-the-loop."
