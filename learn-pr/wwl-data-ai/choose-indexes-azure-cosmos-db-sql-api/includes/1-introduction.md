Azure Cosmos DB SQL API is schema-agnostic. Out of the box, the default indexing policy includes all possible paths and values for a good balance between the thoroughness of the index and performance. You can tune the indexing policy to better match your application’s requirements as you build more complex solutions. In this module, you will explore a few common patterns for adjusting an indexing policy and the resultant index.

After completing this module, you'll be able to:

- Customize an indexing policy for read-heavy workloads
- Customize an indexing policy for write-heavy workloads
