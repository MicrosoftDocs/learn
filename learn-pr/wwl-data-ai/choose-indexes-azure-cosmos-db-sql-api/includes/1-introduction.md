Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL is schema-agnostic. Out of the box, the default indexing policy includes all possible paths and values for a good balance between the thoroughness of the index and performance. You can tune the indexing policy to better match your applicationâ€™s requirements and reduce RU/s (request units per second) consumption for write heavy applications with larger document sizes. In this module, you will explore a few common patterns for adjusting an indexing policy and the resultant index.

After completing this module, you'll be able to:

- Customize an indexing policy for read-heavy workloads
- Customize an indexing policy for write-heavy workloads
