  questions:
  - content: "You've created a bulk operation in Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL that will insert hundreds of thousands of items into a container. You need to temporarily disable indexing and re-enable it after the bulk operation is complete. Prior to starting the bulk operation, which indexing mode should you configure in the indexing policy?"
    choices:
    - content: "None"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Setting the indexing mode to none will disable indexing. This setting can be changed back at a later point in time."
    - content: "Consistent"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The consistent indexing mode will still continue to index items."
    - content: "Automatic"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Automatic isn't a valid indexing mode option."
  - content: "You're authoring a new indexing policy for a container in Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL. You would like to define an included path that includes all possible properties from the root of any JSON document. Which path expression should you use?"
    choices:
    - content: "``/*``"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. The wildcard operator is used to match any elements below the referenced node."
    - content: "``/[]``"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The array operator is exclusively used to address multiple elements together."
    - content: "``/?``"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The scalar operator is used strictly for string or number values at the current node."
