  questions:
  - content: "The application created a bulk operation in Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL that inserts hundreds of thousands of items into a container. The indexing needs to be temporarily disabled and re-enable it after the bulk operation is complete. Before the app starts the bulk operation, which indexing mode should be configured in the indexing policy?"
    choices:
    - content: "None"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Setting the indexing mode to none disables indexing. This setting can be changed back at a later point in time."
    - content: "Consistent"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The consistent indexing mode still continues to index items."
    - content: "Automatic"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Automatic isn't a valid indexing mode option."
  - content: "The application team is authoring a new indexing policy for a container in Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL. The team would like to define an included path that includes all possible properties from the root of any JSON document. Which path expression should the team use?"
    choices:
    - content: "``/*``"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The wildcard operator is used to match any elements below the referenced node."
    - content: "``/[]``"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The array operator is exclusively used to address multiple elements together."
    - content: "``/?``"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The scalar operator is used strictly for string or number values at the current node."
