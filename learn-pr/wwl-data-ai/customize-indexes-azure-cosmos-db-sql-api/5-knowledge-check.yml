  questions:
  - content: "You are writing a C# application that interfaces with Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL and are now tasked with creating a custom indexing policy in code. Which class should you use to author your new indexing policy and customize the indexing mode, enable automatic updates, and set the include/exclude paths?"
    choices:
    - content: "IndexingPolicy"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. The **IndexingPolicy** class is used to define a custom indexing policy in code."
    - content: "ContainerProperties"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The **ContainerProperties** class is used to configure the properties of a new container."
    - content: "IndexingMode"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The **IndexingMode** enum contains potential values to configure the indexing mode of an indexing policy."
  - content: "The most used query in your Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL application is ``SELECT * FROM products p ORDER BY p.name ASC, p.price ASC``. You would like to define a composite index to make the query more efficient and consume fewer RU/s. Which composite index should you use to support this query?"
    choices:
    - content: "``(price ASC, name ASC)``"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The sequence of properties in the composite index must exactly match the ``ORDER BY`` clause."
    - content: "``(price DESC, name ASC)``"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The sequence of properties in the composite index must exactly match the ``ORDER BY`` clause."
    - content: "``(name ASC, price ASC)``"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. This composite index will support the SQL query."
