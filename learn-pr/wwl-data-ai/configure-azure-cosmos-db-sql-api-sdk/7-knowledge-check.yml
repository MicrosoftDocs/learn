  questions:
  - content: "Which of these code samples would create a client that could connect to the Azure Cosmos DB emulator using its default port?"
    choices:
    - content: "``new CosmosClient(\"https://documents.azure.com\", \"C2y6yDjf5/R+ob0N8A7Cgv30VRDJIWEHLM+4QDU5DE2nQ9nDuVTqobD4b8mGGyPMbIZnqyMsEcaGQy67XIw/Jw==\");``"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This code would try to connect to a cloud-based service, which isn't the emulator."
    - content: "``new CosmosClient(\"https://localhost:8081\", \"C2y6yDjf5/R+ob0N8A7Cgv30VRDJIWEHLM+4QDU5DE2nQ9nDuVTqobD4b8mGGyPMbIZnqyMsEcaGQy67XIw/Jw==\");``"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. This code would correctly connect to the emulator using the default port of 8081."
    - content: "``new CosmosClient(\"https://localhost\", \"C2y6yDjf5/R+ob0N8A7Cgv30VRDJIWEHLM+4QDU5DE2nQ9nDuVTqobD4b8mGGyPMbIZnqyMsEcaGQy67XIw/Jw==\");``"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This code would try to connect to the emulator using port 80, which is the incorrect port."
  - content: "Assuming that there's an Azure Cosmos DB container with 50 partitions, which of the following code correctly configures the **QueryRequestOptions** instance to optimize parallelism of requests from the SDK and client?"
    choices:
    - content: "``new QueryRequestOptions { MaxConcurrency = 50 };``"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. This code configures the concurrency to match the number of partitions."
    - content: "``new QueryRequestOptions { MaxItemCount = 50 };``"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This code configures Azure Cosmos DB to only return 50 results at a time."
    - content: "``new QueryRequestOptions { MaxBufferedItemCount = 50 };``"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This code configures the SDK to only buffer 50 items at a time locally."
  - content: "Which class should be inherited from to create a class that intercepts SDK-side HTTP requests and inject extra logic?"
    choices:
    - content: "RequestMessage"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. **RequestMessage** is an SDK class used to represent the actual request itself, not to handle extra logic."
    - content: "HttpRequest"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. **HttpRequest** is a framework-specific class to represent HTTP requests, and doesn't provide any extra functionality in the SDK."
    - content: "RequestHandler"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The **RequestHandler** abstract class defines an overridable method to inject logic in the HTTP request+response flow."
