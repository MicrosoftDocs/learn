In this module, you configured the SDK for common scenarios that may come up with a developer team. You specifically; tuned the parallelism options, handled connection issues, configured the SDK to use with the emulator, and built a custom logger.

Now that you have completed this module, you can:

- Use the Azure Cosmos DB emulator with the SDK
- Handle the most common connection errors with the SDK
- Configure the parallelism options in the SDK client
- Create a custom request handler to log HTTP request from the SDK
