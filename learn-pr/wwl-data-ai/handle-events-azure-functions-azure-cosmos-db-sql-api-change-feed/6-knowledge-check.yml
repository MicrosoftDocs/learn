    choices:

      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. An input binding won't start the execution of a function."
    - content: "Trigger binding"

    - content: "Output binding"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. An output binding will write new items to a container, not monitor for changes."
  - content: "You have an output binding configured for Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL named **items**. You would like to add multiple items to a container using this binding. Which function method parameter should you use to add more than one item to a container?"
    choices:
    - content: "``out Product items``"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. An out parameter with a type will only add a single item to the container."
    - content: "``IAsyncCollector<Product> items``"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The **IAsyncCollector** class contains the **AddAsync** method to add items to a container."
    - content: "``out IEnumerable<Product> items``"

      explanation: "Incorrect. The **IEnumerable** class doesn't contain the necessary methods to add items to a container."
  - content: "When configuring an Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL trigger, which of the following settings would be valid?"
    choices:
    - content: "Assign the **type** to `AzureCosmosDBTrigger`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The **type** will always be set to *`cosmosDBTrigger`."
    - content: "Set the **direction** to **in**."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. For a trigger, this will be set to in."
    - content: "Set the `leaseCollectionName` to the name of the container that will contain all the new leased documents"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The name of the container used to manage change feed leases."
