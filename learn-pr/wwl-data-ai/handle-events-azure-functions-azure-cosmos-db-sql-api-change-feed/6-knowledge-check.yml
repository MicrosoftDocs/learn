    - content: "Output binding"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. An output binding will write new items to a container, not monitor for changes."
  - content: "You have an output binding configured for Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL named **items**. You would like to add multiple items to a container using this binding. Which function method parameter should you use to add more than one item to a container?"
    choices:
    - content: "``out Product items``"

  - content: "When configuring an Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL trigger, which of the following settings would be valid?"
    choices:

      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The **type** will always be set to *`cosmosDBTrigger`."
    - content: "Set the **direction** to **in**."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. For a trigger, this will be set to in."
    - content: "Set the `leaseCollectionName` to the name of the container that will contain all the new leased documents"
