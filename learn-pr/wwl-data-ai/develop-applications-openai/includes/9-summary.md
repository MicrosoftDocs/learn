This module covered the basics of getting started with Azure OpenAI Service with a focus on using the Azure AI Foundry. 

You learned how to:
- Create an Azure OpenAI Service resource and understand types of Azure OpenAI base models.
- Use the Azure AI Foundry, Azure CLI, and REST API to deploy a base model. 
- Generate completions to prompts. 
- Test models in the Studio playground and begin to manage model parameters.

One way to learn more is by exploring the [Azure OpenAI Service documentation](/azure/cognitive-services/openai?azure-portal=true).
