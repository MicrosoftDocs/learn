  questions:
  - content: "You are creating a batch inferencing pipeline that you want to use to predict new values for a large volume of data files. You want the pipeline to run the scoring script on multiple nodes and collate the results. What kind of step should you include in the pipeline?"
    choices:
    - content: "PythonScriptStep"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That is incorrect. You should use a ParallelRunStep step to run the scoring script in parallel."
    - content: "ParallelRunStep"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That is correct. You should use a ParallelRunStep step to run the scoring script in parallel."
    - content: "AdlaStep"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That is incorrect. You should use a ParallelRunStep step to run the scoring script in parallel."
  - content: "You have configured the step in your batch inferencing pipeline with an output_action=\"append_row\" property. In which file should you look for the batch inferencing results?"
    choices:
    - content: "output.txt"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That is incorrect. Using the append_row output action causes the results from the ParallelRunStep step to be collated in a file named parallel_run_step.txt."
    - content: "stdoutlogs.txt"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That is incorrect. Using the append_row output action causes the results from the ParallelRunStep step to be collated in a file named parallel_run_step.txt."
    - content: "parallel_run_step.txt"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That is correct. Using the append_row output action causes the results from the ParallelRunStep step to be collated in a file named parallel_run_step.txt."
