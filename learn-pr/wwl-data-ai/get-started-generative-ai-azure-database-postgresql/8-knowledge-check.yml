quiz:
  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "What is Generative AI (GenAI)?"
    choices:
    - content: "A class of algorithms capable of learning from existing data and producing new content."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. GenAI refers to a class of Artificial Intelligence algorithms that learn from existing multimedia content and generate new content. It can be customized using techniques like prompts and fine-tuning."
    - content: "A type of database extension for PostgreSQL used for interacting with Azure AI Services."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This statement isn't accurate; GenAI isn't an extension for PostgreSQL."
    - content: "A security feature that prevents unauthorized access to the database."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. GenAI isn't a security feature; it focuses on content generation."
  - content: "What is the purpose of the azure_ai extension in Azure Database for PostgreSQL?"
    choices:
    - content: "To enhance database security using Azure AI Services."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While security is essential, the extension's primary purpose isn't related to enhanced security."
    - content: "To enable generative AI language models to be integrated directly within the database."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The azure_ai extension allows using generative AI language models and building generative AI applications within the database."
    - content: "To optimize query performance for complex workloads."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Query optimization isn't the focus of this extension."
  - content: "What are the key characteristics of generative AI language models?"
    choices:
    - content: "Immense scale in terms of the number of parameters used."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Generative AI language models have immense scale, containing hundreds of millions to trillions of parameters."
    - content: "Limited vocabulary and simple architecture."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Generative AI language models have a rich vocabulary and complex architectures."
    - content: "Primarily designed for image recognition."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Generative AI language models are primarily focused on natural language understanding and generation, not image recognition."
