Generative AI (GenAI) refers to AI models that learn from existing data and generate new content, such as text, code, or images, from natural language input. In this module, you see how the `azure_ai` extension for Azure Database for PostgreSQL lets you call Azure AI and Machine Learning services directly from SQL to build GenAI features into your database-backed applications. You use a rental property search scenario to explore how to generate embeddings, run semantic queries, and prepare your data platform for richer GenAI and RAG (retrieval-augmented generation) experiences.

Imagine you’re the lead AI developer for Margie’s Travel, whose web and mobile apps connect travelers with rental properties around the world. Your apps already run on Azure Database for PostgreSQL, and your team wants to add intelligent experiences such as natural language search for listings, personalized recommendations, and AI-generated descriptions. You need a way to integrate Azure AI services and Azure OpenAI with your existing PostgreSQL data so you can experiment quickly and ship new GenAI features using familiar SQL. Throughout this module, you use the Margie’s Travel rental property scenario to explore how the `azure_ai` extension bridges your database and Azure AI.

By the end of this module, you're able to:

- Describe the role of generative AI and generative language models in modern applications.
- Explain how the `azure_ai` extension integrates Azure AI and Azure Machine Learning with Azure Database for PostgreSQL.
- Identify when to use Azure AI services, Azure OpenAI Service, and Azure AI Language with `azure_ai` to build intelligent, data-centric applications.
- Install and verify the `azure_ai` extension in an Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server instance.
