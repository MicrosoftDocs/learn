  questions:
  - content: "Which method of the **Container** class is used to create a new change feed estimator?"
    choices:
    - content: "``GetChangeFeedProcessorBuilder<>``"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The processor builder is used to create the actual change feed processor, not the estimator."
    - content: "``GetChangeFeedEstimatorBuilder``"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. The ``GetChangeFeedEstimatorBuilder`` method constructs an estimator that will run side by side with a processor."
    - content: "``GetChangeFeedIterator<>``"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This method creates an iterator to manually consume a change feed."
  - content: "Which method of the **ChangeFeedProcessor** class should you invoke to start consuming changes from the change feed?"
    choices:
    - content: "``GetChangeFeedProcessorBuilder<>``"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This is a method of the **Container** class that creates the builder to eventually build a change feed processor."
    - content: "``StartAsync``"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. This method is a member of the **ChangeFeedProcessor** class and is invoked to start consuming changes from the change feed."
    - content: "``Build``"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This method is invoked at the end of building a change feed processor (or estimator) and isn't a method of the **ChangeFeedProcessor** class."
