Within the Microsoft Credential portfolio, Microsoft offers two main certification categories: Fundamentals and Advanced Role-Based (ARB). Fundamental certifications focus on skills within Microsoft's specific technology products, such as Azure, Azure AI, Azure Data Identity, Security and Compliance, and business applications.

ARB certifications focus on the skills needed for specific job roles that leverage Microsoft technology products.
