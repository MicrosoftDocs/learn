Suppose you work in the analytics department of a large airline company. You're part of a team that's analyzing the reasons for flight delays based on real-time data from flights around the world. Your job is to analyze the continuous flow of incoming data and stream it to Azure Data Lake storage. That data includes details such as airline, reason for delays, and departure time. You're using Azure Event Hubs to process your data.
