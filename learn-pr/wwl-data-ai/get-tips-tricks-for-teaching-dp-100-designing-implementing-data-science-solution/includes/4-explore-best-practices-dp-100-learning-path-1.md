DP-100: Learning path 1 Design a machine learning solution

Learning path 1 Overview

As you begin to teach this learning path, get familiar with what the students learn during the learning path. In this learning path student learn about designing a machine learning solution including an overview of the entire machine learning process, general concepts, how to design the various aspects of machine learning projects. Students will also learn about designing a data ingestion strategy, a machine learning model training solution, and designing a modern deployment solution.

This learning path consists of five focus areas:

- Identify your data source and format
- Design a data ingestion solution
- Identify machine learning tasks
- Choose a service to train a model
- Choose between compute options
- Decide whether to deploy your model to a real-time or batch endpoint

Learning Path 1 Tips and Tricks

- Be concise for each area. They'll be discussed more in later learning paths
- Leverage the mentioned links
- Use the interactive case study-based activity
- Keep the discussion high level

Learning Path 1 Demos (optional)

- Open and show a customer success story on Azure Machine Learning
- Open the Azure portal and point to data storage options
