All topics covered in the [DP-100: Designing and Implementing a Data Science Solution on Azure](/training/courses/dp-100t01)  course are related to applying data science and machine learning to implement and run machine learning workloads on Azure, designing and creating a suitable working environment for data science workloads; exploring data; training machine learning models; implementing pipelines; running jobs to prepare for production; and managing, deploying, and monitoring scalable machine learning solutions and map directly to [Exam DP-100: Designing and Implementing a Data Science Solution on Azure.](/training/courses/dp-100t01) Percentages indicate the relative weight of each area on the exam. The higher the percentage, the more questions you are likely to see in that area. For the most up-to-date breakdown, access the [DP-100 study guide](https://aka.ms/DP100-StudyGuide) from the [Exam DP-100: Designing and Implementing a Data Science Solution on Azure](/training/courses/dp-100t01) page.

Please note that as you review the DP-100: Designing and Implementing a Data Science Solution on Azure content there is a change in vernacular used to reference modules and units. Modules will be referred to as learning paths and within a learning path the units will be called modules. For example, in DP-100 there are 12 learning paths and in learning path 1 there are 3 modules. Due to timing of content creation, the video vernacular for DP-100 is outdated.

Become familiar with the objective domains which are a comprehensive set of specific and measurable knowledge, skills, and abilities that are the basis for the development of both this course and the certification exam:

- Learning Path 1: Design a machine learning solution
- Learning Path 2: Explore the Azure Machine Learning workspace
- Learning Path 3: Make data available in Azure Machine Learning
- Learning Path 4: Work with compute in Azure Machine Learning
- Learning Path 5: Use no-code machine learning with the Azure Machine Learning designer
- Learning Path 6: Find the best model with Automated Machine Learning
- Learning Path 7: Track model training in Jupyter notebooks with MLflow
- Learning Path 8: Train models with scripts in Azure Machine Learning
- Learning Path 9: Optimize model training in Azure Machine Learning
- Learning Path 10: Manage and review models in Azure Machine Learning
- Learning Path 11: Deploy and consume models with Azure Machine Learning
- Learning Path 12: Design an MLOps solution

Remember that each learning path points back to the core themes of applying data science and machine learning to implement and run machine learning workloads on Azure. Details for each learning path are included in the corresponding learning path best practice sections below.
