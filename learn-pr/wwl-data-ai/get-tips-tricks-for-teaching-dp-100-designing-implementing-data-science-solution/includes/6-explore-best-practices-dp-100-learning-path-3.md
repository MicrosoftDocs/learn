DP-100: Learning Path 3 Make data available in Azure Machine Learning

Learning Path 3 Overview

As you begin to teach this learning path, get familiar with what the students will learn during the learning path. In this learning path students will learn how to make data available in Azure Machine Learning by emphasizing the fact that data happens to be the fundamental element in any machine learning workload. Students will also learn about creating and managing the datastores and data assets, how to use them in the model training experiments, and manage them in Azure Machine Learning workspace.

This learning path consists of one module:
