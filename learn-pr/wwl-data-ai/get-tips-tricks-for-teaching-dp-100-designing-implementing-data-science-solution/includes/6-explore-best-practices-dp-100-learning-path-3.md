DP-100: Learning Path 3 Make data available in Azure Machine Learning

Learning Path 3 Overview

As you begin to teach this learning path, get familiar with what the students learn during the learning path. In this learning path students learn how to make data available in Azure Machine Learning by emphasizing the fact that data happens to be the fundamental element in any machine learning workload. Students will also learn about creating and managing the datastores and data assets, how to use them in the model training experiments, and manage them in Azure Machine Learning workspace.

This learning path consists of three focus areas:

- Work with Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs)
- Create and use datastores
- Create and use data assets

Learning Path 3 Tips and Tricks

- Begin this topic with learner engagement (create a question around storage)
- Incorporate whiteboarding or diagrams as needed
- Mention the three protocols supported: http(s), abfs(s), and azure(ml)
- Discuss the variety of data sources supported

Learning Path 3 Demos (optional)

- Show the built-in datastores (blob datastores and file datastores)
- Demo any one way of creating a data asset
- Show Azure Open datasets
