DP-100: Learning path 5 Find the best model with Automated Machine Learning

Learning path 5 Overview

As you begin to teach this learning path, get familiar with what the students will learn during the learning path. In this learning path students will learn about automated machine learning and how to use it to train, evaluate, and deploy machine learning models without writing any code.

This learning path consists of four focus areas:

- Explore Automate Machine Learning
- Find the best classification model with Automated Machine Learning
- Emphasize when to use AutoML 
- Make learners aware that AutoML supports supervised learning techniques

Learning path 5 Tips and Tricks

- Use a poll to ask if there are citizen data scientists in the learners group
- Emphasize the importance and efficiency of AutoML
- Discuss various supported tasks
- Review the best model in Azure Machine Learning studio

Learning path 5 Demos (optional)

- Configure and set an AutoML classification task with the Python SDK 
- Show the various configuration and featurization options
