DP-100: Learning Path 2 Explore the Azure Machine Learning workspace

Learning Path 2 Overview

As you begin to teach this learning path, get familiar with what the students will learn during the learning path. In this learning path students will learn how to provision an Azure Machine Learning workspace and they'll see how to manage their projects on Azure.

This learning path consists of two modules:

- Module 1 – Explore Azure Machine Learning workspace resources and assets
- Module 2 – Explore developer tools for workspace interaction

Learning Path 2 Tips and Tricks

- Engage with demonstrations for Azure Machine Learning workspace and assets
- Identify and explain different Azure Machine Learning assets (storage, compute, key vault, container)
- Discuss the citizen data scientist tools of AutoML and designer 
- Show Jupyter notebooks
- Invite learners to share what they prefer to use or plan to use for Machine Learning Projects (CLI, Python SDK, and Azure Resource Manager Templates)

Learning Path 2 Demos (optional)

- Demo the Azure Machine Learning workspace in Azure Portal
- Briefly show the AutoML and/or designer pipeline
- Demo one of these for Azure Machine Learning: CLI / SDK / Azure Resource Manager Templates
