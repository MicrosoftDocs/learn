Language Studio is included with the Azure Cognitive Service for Language. Language Studio lets you use UI tools to explore and build AI models focused in language into your solutions. 

These AI models have endpoints that can be used in search solutions to enrich indexes.

This module builds on [Create a custom skill for Azure Cognitive Search](/learn/modules/create-enrichment-pipeline-azure-cognitive-search) but uses a custom text classification model to enrich a search index.

Here you'll explore the features of Language Studio, see how to manually enrich an existing search index, and finally complete an exercise to create and enrich your own search index.

> [!NOTE]
> This module assumes you already know how to create and use an Azure Cognitive Search solution. If not, complete the [Create an Azure Cognitive Search solution](/learn/modules/create-azure-cognitive-search-solution/) module first.
