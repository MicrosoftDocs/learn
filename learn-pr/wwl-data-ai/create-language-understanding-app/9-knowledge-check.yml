  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "Your app must interpret a command such as \"turn on the light\" or \"switch the light on\". What do these phrases represent in a language model?"
    choices:
    - content: "Intents."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. An intent is a possible semantic meaning to be identified by the model."
    - content: "Utterances."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Utterances are example phrases that indicate a specific intent."
    - content: "Entities."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Entities are specific items to which an intent should be applied."
  - content: "Your app must interpret a command to book a flight to a specified city, such as \"Book a flight to Paris.\" How should you model the city element of the command?"
    choices:
    - content: "As an intent."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The city is an entity to which the intent (booking a flight) should be applied."
    - content: "As an utterance."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The city is an entity to which the intent (booking a flight) should be applied."
    - content: "As an entity."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. The city is an entity to which the intent (booking a flight) should be applied."
  - content: "Your language model has multiple intents with similar utterances and many possible entity values. How can you minimize the number of utterances required to train the model?"
    choices:
    - content: "Use Regular Expression entities."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. When a language model has similar utterances with many possible entity values, patterns can reduce the number of utterances required to train an effective model."
    - content: "Use Patterns and Pattern.any() entities."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. When a language model has similar utterances with many possible entity values, patterns can reduce the number of utterances required to train an effective model."
    - content: "Use List entities."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. When a language model has similar utterances with many possible entity values, patterns can reduce the number of utterances required to train an effective model."
