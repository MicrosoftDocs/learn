You can use the power of machine learning to enrich a search index. To do this, you'll use a model trained in Azure AI Machine Learning studio and call it from a machine learning custom skillset.

In this exercise, you'll create an Azure AI Machine Learning Studio model, then train, deploy, and test an endpoint using the model. Then you'll create an Azure AI Search service, create sample data, and enrich an index using the Azure AI Machine Learning studio endpoint.

If you're completing this exercise on your own computer, launch the exercise and follow the instructions.
