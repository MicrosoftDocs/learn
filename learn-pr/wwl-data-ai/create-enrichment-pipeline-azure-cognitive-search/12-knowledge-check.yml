  questions:
  - content: "You want to include a sentiment score for each document in an index. What should you do?"
    choices:
    - content: "Create a custom skill that uses an Azure Machine Learning model to predict the sentiment for a document"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. There is no need to create a custom skill in this scenario."
    - content: "Create a custom skill that calls the Azure AI Language service to predict the sentiment of each document."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. There is no need to create a custom skill in this scenario."
    - content: "Add the built-in Sentiment skill to the skillset used by the indexer."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The built-in sentiment skill can be used to accomplish the goal in this scenario."
  - content: "You have implemented a custom skill as an Azure function. You want to include the custom skill in your Azure Cognitive Search indexing process. What should you do?"
    choices:
    - content: "Add a WebApiSkill to a skillset, referencing the Azure function's URI"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. To integrate an Azure function custom skill into an indexing process, you must define a skillset containing a WebApiSkill with the URI for the function."
    - content: "Create a JSON document with the input schema for your function, and save it in the folder where the documents to be indexed are stored."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Creating a JSON document with the function schema does not include the function in the indexing pipeline."
    - content: "Submit each document to the function, and store the output in a separate data source. Then use the Merge skill to add the results to the index."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The merge skill merges document fields within a single enrichment pipeline. It does not merge data from multiple data sources."
