Historically, the **manufacturing** industry was a leader in implementation of new technologies for automation. Today, the latest wave of AI, including generative AI, is expanding ways to boost productivity and optimization in your factory at a breathtaking pace. New scenarios are now viable, while there are more efficient ways to develop old ones. This module covers these AI use cases for leaders in the manufacturing sector to make better informed decisions when investing in innovation.

Decision-makers often find it challenging to identify the most suitable resources and tools to implement AI use cases in their organizations. For this purpose, this module discusses how specific **Microsoft AI** products and services enable manufacturing scenarios, for you to better understand which option better fits your company’s needs and your workforce’s skills. You can learn more about Microsoft AI products in the [“Leverage AI tools and resources for your business”](/training/modules/leverage-ai-tools) module.

AI in manufacturing isn't only about increasing efficiency and productivity, but also about ensuring ethical and sustainable practices. Accordingly, Microsoft follows **responsible AI** practices for the development and deployment of AI solutions. This approach ensures that solutions are fair, reliable, safe, private, secure, inclusive, transparent, and accountable. Microsoft products follow these principles and empower manufacturers to innovate with confidence and trust. You can take a deeper look at this framework on our [responsible AI website](https://www.microsoft.com/ai/responsible-ai).
