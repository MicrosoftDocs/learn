AI is a powerful tool that can transform the manufacturing industry. It can help optimize production processes, improve quality control, enhance safety, and enable innovation. AI can also augment human capabilities and create new opportunities for workers. There are many **use cases for AI in manufacturing**, and this module covered many of them.

If you want to be efficient in implementing these use cases, **Microsoft AI** delivers powerful products and services to make them true. Azure OpenAI Service enables you to build copilot assistants based on generative AI. You can connect all your data and AI projects with Microsoft Fabric and Azure Machine Learning. Instead of building AI solutions from scratch, Azure AI Services offers ready-to-use AI models.

Now that you have reviewed this module, you should:

* Identify AI use cases in manufacturing.
* Examine available AI tools and resources for manufacturing scenarios.
* Discover insights from manufacturing-specific AI success stories.
