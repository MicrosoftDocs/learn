The popularity of generative AI is disrupting customer expectations. Many manufacturers feel the market pressure to incorporate this technology into their products. Mercedes-Benz sets an example to companies that want to satisfy this demand.

## The organization

**Mercedes-Benz** was founded in 1926 by the merger between two of the oldest automotive manufacturers in the world: Daimler and Benz. Now, they’re a global leader in the production of high-end passenger cars and premium vans, trucks, and buses.

The company enjoys a reputation for its innovative design, engineering excellence, and safety standards. The company has a rich history of creating iconic vehicles that have shaped the automotive industry and culture.

## The challenge

Mercedes-Benz understands their customers expect the best from their vehicles. Their cars must embody a luxurious driving experience. For this reason, they incorporated years ago a complex infotainment system in their vehicles, the **Mercedes-Benz User Experience (MBUX)**.

This service includes the **“Hey Mercedes” voice assistant** to enable drivers to use voice commands for several functions, such as controlling the navigation system, the radio, or the air conditioning.

The feature was well received. However, the spectacular progress of generative AI and LLMs leaves room for improvement: the feature could perform even better thanks to these technologies. Mercedes-Benz decided to incorporate generative AI into the voice assistant to keep offering an **exclusive customer experience**.

## The solution

Mercedes-Benz uses Azure OpenAI Service to integrate ChatGPT into the “Hey Mercedes” feature. The resulting version adds some enhanced capabilities to the infotainment service.

* **Talk naturally to the assistant**: Drivers can interact with the system in a more dynamic, intuitive way beyond mere voice commands.
* **Ask questions freely**: The assistant isn’t limited to a set of simple questions. You can ask for a destination, a recipe, or anything else more elaborate.
* **Ask follow-up questions**: ChatGPT uses context when delivering answers. So, the new “Hey Mercedes” service enables a more complex, multi-turn conversation. For example, you could first ask about a good restaurant in the area, then for the best route to get to it, and later for specific details of the road, without having to repeat the information to the assistant.
* **Integrate with third-party services**: Many companies develop plugins for ChatGPT that enable further functionalities, like booking a restaurant or a movie. The system allows drivers to access these features.

## The results

The new “Hey Mercedes” assistant offers Mercedes-Benz’ customers more connection and intelligence in their cars. It helps reinforce the company’s brand and efforts to deliver a **top-quality driving experience**.

Meanwhile, the service is backed by the **security** standards of the Azure environment. Finally, the expanded capabilities of the assistant take a further step into ensuring drivers keep their hands on the wheel and their eyes on the road.
