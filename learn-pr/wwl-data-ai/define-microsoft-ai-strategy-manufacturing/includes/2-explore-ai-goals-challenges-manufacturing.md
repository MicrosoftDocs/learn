Manufacturing processes involve complex and physical tasks that require precision, coordination, and safety. Moreover, manufacturing systems often face dynamic and uncertain environments that demand adaptability and resilience. To address these issues, AI can enable greater integration, less friction, and simplification of processes across the manufacturing value chain. Following and developing this premise, this unit explores the goals and challenges of AI in manufacturing.

## Goals

When manufacturing companies implement AI solutions, they expect to solve these business problems.

* **Balance the human and technological aspects of production**: Most factories rely on employees and robots working together. An aging workforce and the subsequent loss of institutional knowledge are disturbing this balance, as 46 percent of frontline workers say worker shortages are making it difficult to do their job.<sup>1</sup> AI can find an equipoise by enhancing the skills and capabilities of workers, while also automating and streamlining repetitive or hazardous tasks.
* **Promote worker safety**: AI solutions enable companies to prevent accidents and monitor health conditions. By using AI, manufacturers can create a safer environment for their employees.
* **Automate and simplify**: The manufacturing industry expects AI automation to simplify tasks, reduce errors, and increase efficiency.
* **Analyze data for value creation**: AI can help collect and analyze data from various industrial sources, such as sensors, machines, customers, and suppliers. The purpose is to create value and optimize decision making.
* **Ensure flow and integration**: The workflows at factories are hectic and must be perfectly synchronized to optimize productivity. AI can help with this task by coordinating processes at each stage of the manufacturing cycle, from design to delivery.
* **Minimize energy costs**: AI enables manufacturers to monitor and optimize energy consumption. This use case allows factories to reduce their carbon footprint and save money.
* **Design multi-shoring sourcing strategies**: Manufacturers need to diversify their supply chain by working with several suppliers. This task involves considering the trade-offs between cost, quality, speed, and risk. AI solutions can help you deal with this information to make the best decisions.
* **Comply with environmental regulations**: As environmental regulations get increasingly strict, manufacturers can use AI solutions to avoid fines, enhance their reputation, and contribute to sustainability.

## Challenge

A first set of challenges for AI solutions in manufacturing involves difficulties in **data curation and management**.

* **Niche customers or data types**: Traditional AI models work by finding patterns in large amounts of data. So, it struggles to deal with niche customers or data types without enough data or standardization. In these situations, it might be more effective to reuse pretrained large language models (LLMs), such as those included in Azure OpenAI Service.
* **Unique file types and physical documents**: Manufacturers usually work with a higher proportion of unique file types such as .cad files, or physical documents such as signed contracts. AI systems don’t directly ingest these documents, so you must transform them.
* **Restrictive policies**: Sometimes, getting access to the information and tools you need isn’t straightforward. You might need to navigate complicated data protection policies and access requirements. Besides, workers’ councils and legislations might limit the use of AI in certain contexts.
* **Internal confidential information**: Other times, your own organization requires you to handle certain information with extra care. For example, manufacturing pricing information or design documents are highly sensitive, and you must prevent them from being leaked or misused by unauthorized parties.
* **Inadequate data infrastructure**: AI solutions often get blocked because they rely on complex and cumbersome knowledge repositories. 22 percent of manufacturers fail to scale their AI solution because they don’t have the required tools to process and analyze data.<sup>2</sup>
* **Inability to get actionable insights**: Finally, most manufacturers struggle to get what they need after implementing Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) tools. Only 17 percent of manufacturing leaders claimed to be successful in this task.<sup>3</sup> Usually, this issue is due to companies lacking technical and organizational requirements for these tools to be fully operational.

However, other challenges can arise from the manufacturers’ **relations with customers**.

* **Overdependence on small, traditional customers**: Many small, family-owned, independent companies don’t have an IT department and are unsophisticated in their approach to technology. Business-to-business (B2B) manufacturing companies relying too much on these customers might have trouble trying to get valuable data from them.
* **Inflation**: It’s crushing economic margins so much that it can be challenging to find the resources to implement AI systems or convince customers to pay the required investment.
* **Rising customer expectations for service and products**: The media has lately created hype around generative AI and similar technologies. It’s true that they’re powerful and can make a difference for your business. However, clients often have unrealistic expectations of what an AI-powered solution can deliver. A pedagogical approach is sometimes required to orient customers towards more realistic AI scenarios.

Next, let’s explore the most common AI-powered manufacturing use cases for your company to achieve these goals.
