Now it's time for you to explore Microsoft Copilot for yourself.

> [!NOTE]
> There are two variations of the exercise: one for learners who have access to Microsoft 365 Copilot, and an alternative for learners who don't. **Launch and complete one or the other to explore Microsoft Copilot.**

#### Option 1: Explore Microsoft Copilot in Microsoft Edge

If you don't have access to Microsoft 365 Copilot, launch this version to explore Microsoft Copilot in Microsoft Edge. 

This exercise requires a free Microsoft account (for example an *outlook.com*, *live.com*, or *hotmail.com* account), and the Microsoft Edge web browser.

1. If you don't already have Microsoft Edge installed, download and install it for free from [https://www.microsoft.com/edge/download](https://www.microsoft.com/edge/download).
1. If you don't already have a Microsoft account, sign up for one at [https://signup.live.com](https://signup.live.com).
1. If you haven't already, sign into Microsoft Edge using your Microsoft account.

> [!TIP] 
> If you did not sign into Edge after creating your account, use the user account icon (&#128100;) on the Edge toolbar to sign in using a *personal* account.
