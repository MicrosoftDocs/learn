In this exercise, you create an Azure Managed Redis resource and complete the code for a vector storage application. The application loads sample vector data, stores new vectors with metadata, retrieves vectors by key, and performs similarity searches to find related products. You implement core vector operations including storing vectors with metadata, retrieving stored vectors, calculating vector similarity using cosine similarity, and searching for similar vectors.

Tasks performed in this exercise:

- Download the project starter files
- Create an Azure Managed Redis resource
- Add code to complete business logic
- Run the apps to load, store, and search vector data

This exercise takes approximately **40** minutes to complete.
