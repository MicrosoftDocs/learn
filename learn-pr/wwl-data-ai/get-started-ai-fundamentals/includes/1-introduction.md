Welcome!

You're presumably here because you want to learn more about artificial intelligence (AI). Maybe you've heard about AI in the media and want to know more; or maybe you're going to be adopting AI at work or in school, and want to know more about what to expect.

This training module is designed to provide a high-level overview of some core capabilities of artificial intelligence (AI) and give you an *intuition* of how they work. It's not a deeply technical module, and we won't be writing any code or getting into the mathematical details of machine learning models. Instead, we'll focus on understanding the kinds of things that AI can do, and the basic principles on which it is based.

So, let's go! Move on to the next unit and we'll start our exploration of AI.
