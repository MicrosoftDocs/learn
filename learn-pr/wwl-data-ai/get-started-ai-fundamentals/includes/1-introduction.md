## What is AI?

Simply put, AI is software that imitates human behaviors and capabilities. Key workloads include:

- **Machine learning** - This is often the foundation for an AI system, and is the way we "teach" a computer model to make predictions and draw conclusions from data.
- **Computer vision** - Capabilities within AI to interpret the world visually through cameras, video, and images.
- **Natural language processing** - Capabilities within AI for a computer to interpret written or spoken language, and respond in kind.
- **Document intelligence** - Capabilities within AI that deal with managing, processing, and using high volumes of data found in forms and documents. 
- **Knowledge mining** - Capabilities within AI to extract information from large volumes of often unstructured data to create a searchable knowledge store. 
- **Generative AI** - Capabilities within AI that create original content in a variety of formats including natural language, image, code, and more.
