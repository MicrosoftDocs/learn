## What is AI?

Simply put, AI is the creation of software that imitates human behaviors and capabilities. Key workloads include:

- **Machine learning** - This is often the foundation for an AI system, and is the way we "teach" a computer model to make predictions and draw conclusions from data.
- **Anomaly detection** - The capability to automatically detect errors or unusual activity in a system.
- **Computer vision** - The capability of software to interpret the world visually through cameras, video, and images.
- **Natural language processing** - The capability for a computer to interpret written or spoken language, and respond in kind.
- **Knowledge mining** - The capability to extract information from large volumes of often unstructured data to create a searchable knowledge store.
