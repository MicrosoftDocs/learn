Natural language processing (NLP) is the area of AI that deals with creating software that understands written and spoken language.

NLP enables you to create software that can:

- Analyze and interpret text in documents, email messages, and other sources.
- Interpret spoken language, and synthesize speech responses.
- Automatically translate spoken or written phrases between languages.
- Interpret commands and determine appropriate actions.

For example, *Starship Commander* is a virtual reality (VR) game from Human Interact that takes place in a science fiction world. The game uses natural language processing to enable players to control the narrative and interact with in-game characters and starship systems.

## Natural language processing in Microsoft Azure

You can use Microsoft's **Azure AI Language** to build natural language processing solutions. Some features of Azure AI Language include understanding and analyzing text, training conversational language models that can understand spoken or text-based commands, and building intelligent applications. 

Microsoft's **Azure AI Speech** is another service that can be used to build natural language processing solutions. Azure AI Speech features include speech recognition and synthesis, real-time translations, conversation transcriptions, and more.

You can explore Azure AI Language features in the **Azure Language Studio** and Azure AI Speech features in the **Azure Speech Studio**. The service features are available for use and testing in the studios and other programming languages.
