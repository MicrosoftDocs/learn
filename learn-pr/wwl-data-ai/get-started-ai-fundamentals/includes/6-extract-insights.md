Key points to understand about using AI to extract data and insights include:

- The basis for most document analysis solutions is a computer vision technology called *optical character recognition* (OCR).
- While an OCR model can identify the location of text in an image, more advanced models can also *interpret* individual values in the document - and so extract specific fields.
- While most data extraction models have historically focused on extracting fields from text-based forms, more advanced models that can extract information from audio recording, images, and videos are becoming more readily available.

## Data and insight extraction scenarios

Common uses of AI to extract data and insights include:

- Automated processing of forms and other documents in a business process - for example, processing an expense claim.
- Large-scale digitization of data from paper forms. For example, scanning and archiving census records.
- Indexing documents for search.
- Identifying key points and follow-up actions from meeting transcripts or recordings.
