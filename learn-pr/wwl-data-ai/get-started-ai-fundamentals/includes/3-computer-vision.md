Key points to understand about computer vision include:

- Computer vision is accomplished by using large numbers of images to train a model.
- *Image classification* is a form of computer vision in which a model is trained with images that are labeled with the main subject of the image (in other words, what it's an image *of*) so that it can analyze unlabeled images and predict the most appropriate label - identifying the subject of the image.
- *Object detection* is a form of computer vision in which the model is trained to identify the location of specific objects in an image.
- There are more advanced forms of computer vision - for example, *semantic segmentation* is an advanced form of object detection where, rather than indicate an object's location by drawing a box around it, the model can identify the individual pixels in the image that belong to a particular object.
- You can combine computer vision and language models to create a *multi-modal* model that combines computer vision and generative AI capabilities.

## Computer vision scenarios

Common uses of computer vision include:

- Auto-captioning or tag-generation for photographs.
- Visual search.
- Monitoring stock levels or identifying items for checkout in retail scenarios.
- Security video monitoring.
- Authentication through facial recognition.
- Robotics and self-driving vehicles.
