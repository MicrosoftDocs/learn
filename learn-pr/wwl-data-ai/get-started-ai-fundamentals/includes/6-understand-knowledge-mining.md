Knowledge mining is the term used to describe solutions that involve extracting information from large volumes of often unstructured data to create a searchable knowledge store. 

## Knowledge mining in Microsoft Azure

One of these knowledge mining solutions is **Azure Cognitive Search**, a private, enterprise, search solution that has tools for building indexes. The indexes can then be used for internal only use, or to enable searchable content on public facing internet assets. 

Azure Cognitive Search can utilize the built-in AI capabilities of Azure AI services such as image processing, content extraction, and natural language processing to perform knowledge mining of documents. The product's AI capabilities makes it possible to index previously unsearchable documents and to extract and surface insights from large amounts of data quickly.
