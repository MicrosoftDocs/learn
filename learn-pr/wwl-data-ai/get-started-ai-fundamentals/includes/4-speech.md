Key points to understand about speech include:

- *Speech recognition* is the ability of AI to "hear" and interpret speech. Usually this capability takes the form of *speech-to-text* (where the audio signal for the speech is transcribed into text).
- *Speech synthesis* is the ability of AI to vocalize words as spoken language. Usually this capability takes the form of *text-to-speech* in which information in text format is converted into an audible signal.
- AI speech technology is evolving rapidly to handle challenges like ignoring background noise, detecting interruptions, and generating increasingly expressive and human-like voices.

## AI speech scenarios

Common uses of AI speech technologies include:

- Personal AI assistants in phones, computers, or household devices with which you interact by talking.
- Automated transcription of calls or meetings.
- Automating audio descriptions of video or text.
- Automated speech translation between languages.
