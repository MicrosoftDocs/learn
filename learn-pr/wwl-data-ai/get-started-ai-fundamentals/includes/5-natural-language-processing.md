Key points to understand about natural language processing (NLP) include:

- NLP capabilities are based on models that are trained to do particular types of text analysis.
- While many natural language processing scenarios are handled by generative AI models today, there are many common text analytics use cases where simpler NLP language models can be more cost-effective.
- Common NLP tasks include:
    - *Entity extraction* - identifying mentions of entities like people, places, organizations in a document
    - *Text classification* - assigning document to a specific category.
    - *Sentiment analysis* - determining whether a body of text is positive, negative, or neutral and inferring opinions.
    - *Language detection* - identifying the language in which text is written.

> [!NOTE]
> In this module, we've used the term *natural language processing* (NLP) to describe AI capabilities derive meaning from "ordinary" human language. You might also see this area of AI referred to as *natural language understanding* (NLU).

## Natural language processing scenarios

Common uses of NLP technologies include:

- Analyzing document or transcripts of calls and meetings to determine key subjects and identify specific mentions of people, places, organizations, products, or other entities.
- Analyzing social media posts, product reviews, or articles to evaluate sentiment and opinion.
- Implementing chatbots that can answer frequently asked questions or orchestrate predictable conversational dialogs that don't require the complexity of generative AI.
