Key points to understand about natural language processing (NLP) include:

- NLP has a long history, from the early days of applying *frequency analysis* techniques to find frequently occurring words in a body (corpus) of text (and consequently infer the major subjects discussed in it) to *vector-based* models that use numerical representations of words and other text *tokens* (like punctuation or parts of words) to define semantic relationships between them.
- While a lot of natural language processing scenarios are handled by generative AI models today, there are many common text analytics use cases where simpler NLP language models can be more cost-effective.
- Common NLP tasks include *entity extraction* (identifying mentions of entities like people, places, organizations in a document), *text classification* (assigning document to a specific category) - including *sentiment analysis* (determining whether a body of text is positive, negative, or neutral), and language detection (identifying the language in which text is written).

> [!NOTE]
> In this module, we've used the term *natural language processing* (NLP) to describe AI capabilities that involve deriving meaning from "ordinary" human language" (usually in text format). You may also see this area of AI referred to as *natural language understanding* (NLU).

## Natural language processing scenarios

Common uses of NLP technologies include:

- Analyzing document or transcripts of calls and meetings to determine key topics and identify specific mentions of people, places, organizations, products, or other entities.
- Analyzing social media posts, product reviews, or articles to evaluate sentiment and opinion.
- Implementing chatbots that can answer frequently asked questions or orchestrate predictable conversational dialogs that don't require the complexity of generative AI.
