Artificial Intelligence is a powerful tool that can be used to greatly benefit the world. However, like any tool, it must be used responsibly.

The following table shows some of the potential challenges and risks facing an AI application developer.

| Challenge or Risk | Example |
| ----------------- | ------- |
| Bias can affect results | A loan-approval model discriminates by gender due to bias in the data with which it was trained |
| Errors may cause harm | An autonomous vehicle experiences a system failure and causes a collision |
| Data could be exposed | A medical diagnostic bot is trained using sensitive patient data, which is stored insecurely |
| Solutions may not work for everyone | A home automation assistant provides no audio output for visually impaired users |
| Users must trust a complex system | An AI-based financial tool makes investment recommendations -  what are they based on? |
| Who's liable for AI-driven decisions? | An innocent person is convicted of a crime based on evidence from facial recognition – who's responsible? |
