  - content: "You are designing an AI application that uses computer vision to detect cracks in car windshields, and warns drivers when a windshield should be repaired or replaced. When tested in good lighting conditions, the application successfully detects 99% of dangerously damaged glass. Which of the following statements should you include in the application's user interface?"
    choices:
