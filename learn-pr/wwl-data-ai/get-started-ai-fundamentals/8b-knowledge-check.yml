  questions:
  - content: "You want to create a model to predict sales of ice cream based on historic data that includes daily ice cream sales totals and weather measurements. Which Azure service should you use?"
    choices:
    - content: "Azure Machine Learning"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That is correct. Azure Machine Learning enables you to train a predictive model from the existing data."
    - content: "Azure AI Bot Service"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That is incorrect. The Azure AI Bot Service provides a platform for conversational AI."
    - content: "Azure AI Language"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That is incorrect. The Language Service is used for understanding and analyzing text, and creating intelligent applications."
  - content: "You work for a wildlife sanctuary and are considering using AI to identify bird species from images. Which AI service should you use to prototype your idea?"
    choices:
    - content: "Azure AI Vision"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Azure AI Vision allows you to add images to the existing model to improve the image identifier model. This is a good choice for identifying the small differences between bird species."
    - content: "Azure AI Search"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Azure AI Search includes data extraction and indexing capabilities for knowledge mining. Another Azure AI service should be used to identify individual bird species."
