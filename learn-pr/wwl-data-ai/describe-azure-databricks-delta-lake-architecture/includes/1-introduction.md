Imagine that you work in the IT department of a large retail store. Your organization uses Azure Data Lake to store all its online shopping data. However, as the volume of data increases, updating and querying information is becoming more and more time consuming. Your responsibility is to investigate the problem and find a solution.

In addition, your batch processing needs to be augmented with stream processing to gain insights on user clickstream data from online shoppers. As a result, your solution also needs to handle the emerging stream processing requirements. You have investigated using a Lambda architecture, which is a big data processing architecture that combines both batch- and real-time processing methods. However, it is difficult to combine processing of batch and real-time data using a traditional Lambda architecture.

You need a solution that matches Data Lake in scalability but is also reliable and fast. You also need your solution that effectively combines batch and real-time data processing.

Delta Lake can solve your problem. It's a unified data-management system that combines the best capabilities of Data Lake, data warehousing, and a streaming ingestion system.

## Learning objectives
