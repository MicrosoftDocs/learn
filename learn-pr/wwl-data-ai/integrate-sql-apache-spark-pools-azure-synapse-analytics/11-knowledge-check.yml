  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "When could SQL Auth be used for transferring Data between a dedicated SQL Pool and a serverless Apache Spark Pool using the Azure Synapse Apache Spark Pool to Synapse SQL connector?"
    choices:
    - content: "Always, anytime you want to transfer data between the SQL and Spark Pool."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "InCorrect. Currently, the Azure Synapse Apache Spark Pool to Synapse SQL connector does not support a token-based authentication to a dedicated SQL pool that is outside of the workspace of Synapse Analytics. In order to establish and transfer data to a dedicated SQL pool that is outside of the workspace without Azure AD, you would have to use SQL Auth."
    - content: "Never, it is not necessary to use SQL Auth when transferring data between a SQL or Spark Pool."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Currently, the Azure Synapse Apache Spark Pool to Synapse SQL connector does not support a token-based authentication to a dedicated SQL pool that is outside of the workspace of Synapse Analytics. In order to establish and transfer data to a dedicated SQL pool that is outside of the workspace without Azure AD, you would have to use SQL Auth."
    - content: "When you need a token-based authentication to a dedicated SQL outside of the Synapse Analytics workspace."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Currently, the Azure Synapse Apache Spark Pool to Synapse SQL connector does not support a token-based authentication to a dedicated SQL pool that is outside of the workspace of Synapse Analytics. In order to establish and transfer data to a dedicated SQL pool that is outside of the workspace without Azure AD, you would have to use SQL Auth."
  - content: "When is it unnecessary to use import statements for transferring data between a dedicated SQL and Spark pool?"
    choices:
    - content: "Use the integrated notebook experience from Azure Synapse Studio."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Import statements are not needed since they are pre-loaded in case you use the Azure Synapse Studio integrated notebook experience."
    - content: "Use the PySpark connector."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Import statements are not needed since they are pre-loaded in case you use the Azure Synapse Studio integrated notebook experience."
    - content: "Use token-based authentication."
      isCorrect: false
