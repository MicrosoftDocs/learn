  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "In what language can the Azure Synapse Apache Spark to Synapse SQL connector be used?"
    choices:
    - content: "Python."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The connector does not work in Python, it has been made available in Scala."
    - content: "SQL."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The connector currently does not work in SQL, it has been made available in Scala."
    - content: "Scala."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The connector uses Scala to integrate Apache Spark pools with dedicated SQL pools in Azure Synapse Analytics."
  - content: "When is it unnecessary to use import statements for transferring data between a dedicated SQL and Apache Spark pool?"
    choices:
    - content: "Use the integrated notebook experience from Azure Synapse Studio."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Import statements are not needed since they are pre-loaded in case you use the Azure Synapse Studio integrated notebook experience."
    - content: "Use the PySpark connector."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Import statements are not needed since they are pre-loaded in case you use the Azure Synapse Studio integrated notebook experience. Use PySpark with the connector, to transfer data to or from a dedicated SQL pool or database outside the workspace."
    - content: "Use token-based authentication."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Currently the Azure Synapse Apache Spark to Synapse SQL connector doesn't support token-based authentication to a dedicated SQL pool that is outside of the workspace. You'll need to use SQL Authentication."
