Azure AI Document Intelligence uses Azure AI Services to analyze the content of scanned forms and convert them into data. It can recognize text values in both common forms and forms that are unique to your business.

In this module, we'll consider this scenario: You work for a company that conducts polls for private companies and political parties. Participants submit their responses as paper forms or as online PDFs. You currently spend a lot of time and money entering these responses into databases. You want to assess Azure AI Document Intelligence to find out if you can use it to streamline this process.

In this module, you'll learn about the architecture of Azure AI Document Intelligence and how to design a solution that can ingest data from forms into a data store.

## Learning objectives:

At the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Describe the components of an Azure AI Document Intelligence solution.
- Create and connect to Azure AI Document Intelligence resources in Azure.
- Choose whether to use a prebuilt, custom, or composed model.
