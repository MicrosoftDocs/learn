  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "You want to create an Azure AI Document Intelligence model where the documents are in one of three formats: wills, probate declarations, and affidavits. Each has their own specific layout. What type of model should you use that will understand the format of the three document categories?"
    choices:
    - content: "A Read model."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A Read model obtains text and key-value pairs from the legal documents but won't categorize them."
    - content: "A Layout model."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A Layout model obtains structure information, select marks, and other information from the legal forms, but won't categorize them"
    - content: "A Composed model."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. A Composed model consists of multiple custom models. Each submitted form is categorized as one of the custom form types and analyzed using the corresponding custom model."
  - content: "You have developed a custom model that analyzes health assessment forms returned by patients to a medical practice. You've observed too much inaccuracy in the values that the model extracts for each field. What should you do to address this problem?"
    choices:
    - content: "Retrain the model with a larger number of example forms."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The larger the number of example forms you use to train a model, the more accurate it will be and the higher the confidence levels will be."
    - content: "Change from a custom model to the general document model."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The general document model won't help to improve field value extraction for specific document types."
    - content: "Change from the free tier to the standard tier."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The tier you use for your Azure AI Document Intelligence resource doesn't affect the accuracy of field value extraction."
  - content: "You want to call your Azure AI Document Intelligence solution from a mobile app by using an API. Which of the following programming languages is natively supported as an Azure AI Document Intelligence SDK?"
    choices:
    - content: "Python"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Microsoft publishes a Python API you can use to call Azure AI Document Intelligence services."
    - content: "Go"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. There's no Azure AI Document Intelligence API for Go, but you can submit requests through the RESTful web service."
    - content: "R"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. There's no Azure AI Document Intelligence API for R, but you can submit requests through the RESTful web service."
  - content: "You're building a solution that analyzes sales invoices. You expect to receive up to 10 concurrent requests at busy times and you want your solution to be as simple as possible. What kind of resource should you create?"
    choices:
    - content: "A Free tier Azure AI Document Intelligence resource."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The Free tier supports one request at a time."
    - content: "A Standard tier Azure AI Document Intelligence resource."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The Standard tier supports up to 15 concurrent requests and you don't need other Azure AI Services."
    - content: "An Azure AI Services multi-service resource."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. You can't add Azure AI Document Intelligence to an Azure AI Services multi-service resource."
  - content: "Which of the following values is required to connect to an Azure AI Document Intelligence service?"
    choices:
    - content: "The name of your Azure subscription."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The name of the Azure subscription isn't required to connect to Azure AI Document Intelligence."
    - content: "The endpoint and API key for the Azure resource."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. You must supply the endpoint and an access key to authenticate when you use an Azure AI Document Intelligence service to analyze forms."
    - content: "The name of the Azure region where your Azure AI Document Intelligence service runs."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. You don't need to specify an Azure region to connect to Azure AI Document Intelligence."
  - content: "Which of the following is an Azure AI Document Intelligence prebuilt model?"
    choices:
    - content: "Employment record"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. There's no employment record prebuilt model in Azure AI Document Intelligence although you can analyze scanned employment records and extract text, key/values pairs, and other information"
    - content: "Resume"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. There's no resume prebuilt model in Azure AI Document Intelligence although you can analyze scanned resumes and extract text, key/values pairs, and other information."
    - content: "Receipt"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The receipt model can identify commonly used fields and their values in scanned or photographed receipt documents."
