quiz:
  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "You want to create an Azure AI Document Intelligence model where the documents are in one of three formats: wills, probate declarations, and affidavits. Each has their own specific layout. What type of model should you use that will understand the format of the three document categories?"
    choices:
    - content: "A Read model."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A Read model obtains text and key-value pairs from the legal documents but won't categorize them."
    - content: "A Layout model."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A Layout model obtains structure information, select marks, and other information from the legal forms, but won't categorize them"
    - content: "A Composed model."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. A Composed model consists of multiple custom models. Each submitted form is categorized as one of the custom form types and analyzed using the corresponding custom model."
  - content: "You have developed a custom model that analyzes health assessment forms returned by patients to a medical practice. You've observed too much inaccuracy in the values that the model extracts for each field. What should you do to address this problem?"
    choices:
    - content: "Retrain the model with a larger number of example forms."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The larger the number of example forms you use to train a model, the more accurate it will be and the higher the confidence levels will be."
    - content: "Change from a custom model to the general document model."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The general document model won't help to improve field value extraction for specific document types."
    - content: "Change from the free tier to the standard tier."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The tier you use for your Azure AI Document Intelligence resource doesn't affect the accuracy of field value extraction."
  - content: "You want to call your Azure AI Document Intelligence solution from a mobile app by using an API. Which of the following programming languages is natively supported as an Azure AI Document Intelligence SDK?"
    choices:
    - content: "Python"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Microsoft publishes a Python API you can use to call Azure AI Document Intelligence services."
    - content: "Go"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. There's no Azure AI Document Intelligence API for Go, but you can submit requests through the RESTful web service."
    - content: "R"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. There's no Azure AI Document Intelligence API for R, but you can submit requests through the RESTful web service."
  - content: "Which of the following is an Azure AI Document Intelligence prebuilt model?"
    choices:
    - content: "Employment record"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. There's no employment record prebuilt model in Azure AI Document Intelligence although you can analyze scanned employment records and extract text, key/values pairs, and other information"
    - content: "Resume"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. There's no resume prebuilt model in Azure AI Document Intelligence although you can analyze scanned resumes and extract text, key/values pairs, and other information."
    - content: "Receipt"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The receipt model can identify commonly used fields and their values in scanned or photographed receipt documents."
