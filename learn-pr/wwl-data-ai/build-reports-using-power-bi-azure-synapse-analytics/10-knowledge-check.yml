  questions:
  - content: "What data source connection method loads all of the data into the Power BI cache, and runs queries against the ingested data?"
    choices:
    - content: "DirectQuery."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. DirectQuery helps connecting directly to data in the original source repository and queries are sent to the underlying data source to retrieve the necessary data."
    - content: "Import Connection."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. You can use Get Data in Power BI Desktop to connect to a data source like SQL Server for import."
    - content: "Hybrid Connection"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. There is no such connection method for Power BI."
  - content: "What can be considered a benefit of materialized views?"
    choices:
    - content: "A different data distribution compared to the base tables."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The data in a materialized view can be distributed differently from the base tables."
    - content: "Decreased query performance for complex queries with JOINs and aggregate functions, but increased performance for simple queries."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The more complex the query, the higher the potential for execution-time saving."
    - content: "Instant query response times for repetitive query patterns."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. For predictable and repetitive query patterns, result-set caching is the feature that can provide instant query response times."
  - content: "What is a limitation of result-set caching?"
    choices:
    - content: "The maximum size of the result set cache is 1 TB per database."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. When the result set cache approaches the maximum size, cache eviction will start."
    - content: "Users cant manually empty the result set cache."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Users can turn OFF the result set cache feature or run `DBCC DROPRESULTSETCACHE` while connected to the database to empty the entire result set cache."
    - content: "Pausing the database will clean the cache."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Pausing a database won't empty cached result set."
