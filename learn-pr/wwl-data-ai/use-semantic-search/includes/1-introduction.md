Suppose that you work for a company that is developing an app for local tourists. You have huge amounts of information about local tourist sites, but when users search for information sometimes they don't find the most relevant articles at the top of their search results. To improve the usability of your app, you're investigating how to return more relevant results to users by using Azure AI Search.

In this module, you'll learn how to improve search results and return more relevant results using semantic ranking in Azure AI Search.

After completing this module, you'll be able to:

- Describe semantic ranking
- Set up semantic ranking
- Perform semantic ranking on an index
