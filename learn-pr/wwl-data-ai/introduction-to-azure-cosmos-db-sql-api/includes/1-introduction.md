Today's apps deliver innovation in all facets of life. For a business to remain competitive, companies must build apps and products that work with real-time data, are resilient, and flexible.

Modern apps thrive on real-time data from different sources and shaped in different forms. An apps' usefulness is often in their ability to move and use data.

Developers require flexibility in their platforms so they can be responsive to business changes. Developers also require their entire application ecosystem to flexibly handle changes in the velocity, volume, or shape of their data. This flexibility enables developers to develop new features more rapidly than they ever have before.

## Scenario

Suppose you work as the lead developer at a retail company. Your team is building your online storefront. The new storefront will be designed to be accessible across various devices including mobile. The team expects a spike in demand when the storefront is published and various "grand opening" sales begin.

As the lead developer, you have been tasked with identifying a database platform. The database platforms you consider should be able to service the data your team will generate and collect over time. The selected database should also be able to handle a large variety of data, at high volumes and velocity. Your database solution needs to scale quickly and with little friction in order to handle this demand that is both growing and variable.

## Azure Cosmos DB

Azure Cosmos DB is a fast NoSQL database service for modern app development at any scale.
