  questions:
  - content: "Which API is considered the \"native API\" for Azure Cosmos DB?"
    choices:
    - content: "MongoDB API"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. While the MongoDB API implements the wire protocol for MongoDB, it is not the native API for Azure Cosmos DB."
    - content: "Cassandra API"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. While the Cassandra API implements the much of the native Apache Cassandra wire protocol, it is not the native API for Azure Cosmos DB."
    - content: "SQL API"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. The SQL API is the native API for Azure Cosmos DB. All other APIs map to the SQL API in their implementations."
  - content: "Which property is required to be specified when creating a new Azure Cosmos DB SQL API container?"
    choices:
    - content: "Partition key path"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. All containers in an Azure Cosmos DB SQL API database must have a partition key path defined."
    - content: "Time-to-live"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. You can create a container without a time-to-live value. The container will not expire items automatically."
    - content: "Indexing policy"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. You can create a container without specifying an indexing policy. Azure Cosmos DB will automatically index every property of every item."
  - content: "Your team has an existing Azure Cosmos DB account, database, and container. A new team member would like to configure Azure Cosmos DB for a different team with unique needs for regional replication and default consistency levels. Which new resource should that member of the team create?"
    choices:
    - content: "Container"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. If your team member creates a new container, the default consistency level and global replication settings will remain the same between both teams."
    - content: "Account"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. In order to have different behavior for replication and default consistency, your team member must create a new account."
    - content: "Database"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. If your team member creates a new database, the default consistency level and global replication settings will remain the same between both teams."
