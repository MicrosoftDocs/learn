  questions:
  - content: "The database has a container of products with JSON documents that contain a string property named **name**. The JSON documents also all contain a property named **tags** that's an array of string values. The team is tasked with authoring a SQL query that creates a cross-product of the document names and tags. Which SQL query should be used?"
    choices:
    - content: "``SELECT p.name, t.tags[0] FROM products p``"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This query returns the name from the document and only the first string tag value. This query doesn't create a cross-product."
    - content: "``SELECT p.name, t.tags FROM products p``"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This query only selects the existing name value and array of tags. This query doesn't create a cross-product."
    - content: "``SELECT p.name, t FROM products p JOIN t IN p.tags``"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. This query creates a cross-product of name and tag values."
  - content: "Which method of the **Microsoft.Azure.Cosmos.Container** class takes in a SQL query as a string parameter and returns an iterator that can be used to iterate over the query results as deserialized C# objects?"
    choices:
    - content: "``GetItemQueryStreamIterator<>``"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This method keeps the results as Streams to minimize the deserialization overhead."
    - content: "``GetItemQueryIterator<>``"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. This method uses a SQL string to construct the query and then deserialize the results into C# objects."
    - content: "``GetItemLinqQueryable<>``"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This method uses the LINQ query syntax rather than a SQL string to construct the query."
