It's not uncommon for JSON documents to include child documents and arrays. These more complex documents require SQL queries with more complex expressions than ones that are available in the typical SQL language used with typical relational databases. In this module, you learn how to author complex queries using cross-products and correlated subqueries.

After completing this module, you'll be able to:

- Implement a correlated subquery
- Create a cross-product query
