Relational databases usually contain multiple tables that are linked by common *key* fields. This *normalized* design minimizes duplication of data, but means that you'll often need to write queries to retrieve related data from two or more tables. 

In this module, you'll learn how to:
- Understand join concepts and syntax
- Write queries that use inner joins
- Write queries that use outer joins
- Write queries that use cross joins
- Write queries that use self-joins
