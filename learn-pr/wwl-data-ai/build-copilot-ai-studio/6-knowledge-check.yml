quiz:
  questions:
  - content: "What does groundedness refer to in the context of generative AI?"
    choices:
    - content: "The use of a locally deployed language model."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. RGroundedness doesn't refer to the location where the model is deployed."
    - content: "Using data to contextualize prompts and ensure relevant responses."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. Groundedness involves using a data source to *ground* prompts and ensure accurate, relevant responses."
    - content: "Using the lowest possible number of tokens in a prompt."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Groundedness doesn't minimize the number of tokens in a prompt."
  - content: "What pattern can you use to ground prompts?"
    choices:
    - content: "Metadata Optimized Prompt (MOP)."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. There's no MOP pattern for grounding prompts."
    - content: "Data Understanding Support Text (DUST)."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. There's no DUST pattern for grounding prompts."
    - content: "Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The RAG pattern is used to add grounding data to prompts."
  - content: "How can you use the RAG pattern in a client app that uses the Azure OpenAI SDK?"
    choices:
    - content: "Add text files containing the grounding data to the app folder."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. You shouldn't include grounding data as text files in the app folder."
    - content: "You don't need to do anything. Azure AI Foundry automatically grounds all prompts using Bing Search."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Azure AI Foundry doesn't automatically ground all prompts using Bing Search."
    - content: "Add index connection details to the OpenAI ChatClient configuration."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Adding index connection information to the client enables grounding of prompts."
