quiz:
  questions:
  - content: "What does groundedness refer to in the context of generative AI?"
    choices:
    - content: "The use of a locally deployed language model."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. RGroundedness doesn't refer to the location where the model is deployed."
    - content: "Using data to contextualize prompts and ensure relevant responses."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. Groundedness involves using a data source to *ground* prompts and ensure accurate, relevant responses."
    - content: "Using the lowest possible number of tokens in a prompt."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Groundedness does not minimize the number of tokens in a prompt."
  - content: "What pattern can you use to ground prompts?"
    choices:
    - content: "Metadata Optimized Prompt (MOP)."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. There is no MOP pattern for grounding prompts."
    - content: "Data Understanding Support Text (DUST)."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. There is no DUST pattern for grounding prompts."
    - content: "Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The RAG pattern is used to add grounding data to prompts."
  - content: "Which tool enables you to retrieve grounding data in a prompt flow?"
    choices:
    - content: "Query tool."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. There is no Query tool in Promot Flow."
    - content: "Content Safety tool."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The Content Safety tool does not retrieve grounding data."
    - content: "Index Lookup tool."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. You can use the Index lookup tool to retrieve grounding data from an index in Prompt Flow."
