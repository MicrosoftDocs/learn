  questions:
  - content: "What does Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) refer to in the context of a language model application?"
    choices:
    - content: "RAG helps you fine-tune a language model."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. RAG doesn't fine-tune a language model."
    - content: "RAG helps you to integrate a language model in a chat-based application."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. RAG's purpose isn't to integrate a language model."
    - content: "RAG helps you ground your language model."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. RAG allows you to retrieve context that helps ground your language model."
  - content: "Which search method is most likely to yield the most accurate results when integrating it with a copilot?"
    choices:
    - content: "Keyword search."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Keyword search relies solely on predefined terms or phrases, potentially missing relevant information that doesn't match the exact keywords used."
    - content: "Vector search."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Vector search uses mathematical representations of documents, which can capture semantic relationships and similarities between documents, but it can still miss context-specific information."
    - content: "Hybrid search."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Hybrid search combines the strengths of both keyword and vector search methods, allowing for a more comprehensive and accurate retrieval of relevant information by using both keyword matching and semantic similarity."
  - content: "When integrating RAG and a language model in a chat flow to build a copilot, what is the purpose of using prompt variants?"
    choices:
    - content: "To modify the user's query with historical data."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Modifying the user's query with historical data is achieved through the Large Language Model (LLM) node, not through prompt variants."
    - content: "To generate prompt context by retrieving relevant information from the data source."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Generating prompt context is done by parsing the output of the Index Lookup tool, not through prompt variants."
    - content: "To provide multiple system messages in the prompt."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Prompt variants allow for the inclusion of different system messages in the prompt, exploring which content provides the most groundedness."
