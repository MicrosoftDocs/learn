Language models are growing in popularity as they create impressive coherent answers to a userâ€™s questions. Especially when a user interacts with a language model through chat, it provides an intuitive way to get the information they need.

One prevalent challenge when implementing language models through chat is the so-called **groundedness**, which refers to whether a response is rooted, connected, or anchored in reality or a specific context. In other words, groundedness refers to whether the response of a language model is based on factual information.

In this module, you explore how to create your own chat-based language model application that is grounded, by building a copilot with your own data.
