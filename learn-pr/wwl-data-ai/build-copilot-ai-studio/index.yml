  title: Build a RAG-based copilot solution with your own data using Azure AI Studio
  description: Copilots can work alongside you to provide suggestions, generate content, or help you make decisions. Copilots use language models as a form of generative artificial intelligence (AI) and will answer your questions using the data they were trained on. To ensure a copilot retrieves information from a specific source, you can add your own data when building a copilot with the Azure AI Studio.

abstract: |
  By the end of this module, you'll be able to:
    - Identify the need to ground your language model with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)
    - Index your data with Azure AI Search to make it searchable for language models
    - Build a copilot using RAG on your own data in the Azure AI Studio
prerequisites: |
  Before starting this module, you should be familiar with fundamental AI concepts and services in Azure. Consider completing the [Get started with artificial intelligence](/training/paths/get-started-with-artificial-intelligence-on-azure) learning path first.
