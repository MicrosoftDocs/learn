  By the end of this module, you'll be able to:
    - Identify the need to ground your language model with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)
    - Index your data with Azure AI Search to make it searchable for language models
    - Build an agent using RAG on your own data in the Azure AI Foundry portal
prerequisites: |
  Before starting this module, you should be familiar with fundamental AI concepts and services in Azure.
