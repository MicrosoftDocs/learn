An Azure AI hub can host one or more *projects*. Each project encapsulates the tools and assets used to create a specific AI solution. For example, you might create a project to enable data scientists and developers to collaborate on building a custom copilot for a business application or process.

## What can I do with a project?

All AI development in Azure AI Studio is performed within a project. You can create a new project on the **Build** page in Azure AI Studio, and then use it to:

- Deploy large language models to support a chatbot or copilot.
- Test models in the chat playground.
- Add your own data to augment prompts.
- Use *prompt flow* to define flows that combine models, prompts, and custom code.
- Evaluate model responses to prompts.
- Manage indexes and datasets for custom data.
- Define content filters to mitigate potentially harmful responses.
- Use Visual Studio Code in your browser to create custom code.
- Deploy solutions as web apps and containerized services.
