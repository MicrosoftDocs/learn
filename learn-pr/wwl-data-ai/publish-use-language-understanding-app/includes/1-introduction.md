The Language Understanding service enables you to define and train language models that predict a user's *intent* from natural language input. To use this model in an application, you need to publish the Language Understanding app for your model and consume it from a client application or bot.

In this module, you will learn how to publish and use language understanding apps.

After completing this module, you’ll be able to:

- Set Language Understanding app publishing configuration options.
- Describe Language Understanding prediction results.
- Deploy the Language Understanding Service as a container.
