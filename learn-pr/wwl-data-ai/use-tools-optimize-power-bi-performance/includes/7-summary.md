You've been introduced to three tools that you can use to  troubleshoot and improve data models.

To optimize a slow report, you can run the Performance analyzer to measure how each of the report elements performs when users interact with them. From there, you can dig into DAX query performance in DAX Studio, where you can view, sort, and filter performance data. You can also troubleshoot single measures or queries and/or evaluate the overall performance of your data model. To design data models proactively, you can use the Best Practice Analyzer rules in Tabular Editor to implement data modeling best practices as you go.
