  questions:
  - content: "You want to create a model to predict the cost of heating an office building based on its size in square feet and the number of employees working there. What kind of machine learning problem is this?"
    choices:
    - content: "Regression"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Regression models predict numeric values."
    - content: "Classification"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Classification models predict the class to which an observed case belongs."
    - content: "Clustering"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Clustering models group similar items together."
  - content: "You need to evaluate a classification model. Which metric can you use? ​​"
    choices:
    - content: "Mean squared error (MSE)"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. MSE is used to evaluate regression models."
    - content: "Precision"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Precision is a useful metric for evaluating classification models."
    - content: "Silhouette"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Silhouette is used to evaluate clustering models."
  - content: "In deep learning, what is the purpose of a loss function?"
    choices:
    - content: "To remove data for which no known label values are provided"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A loss function does not remove data."
    - content: "To evaluate the aggregate difference between predicted and actual label values"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. A loss function determines the overall variance, or loss, between predicted and actual label values."
    - content: "To calculate the cost of training a neural network rather than a statistical model"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A loss function does not calculate cost."
  - content: "What does automated machine learning in Azure Machine Learning enable you to do?"
    choices:
    - content: "Automatically deploy new versions of a model as they're trained"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Automated machine learning does not automatically deploy models."
    - content: "Automatically provision Azure Machine Learning workspaces for new data scientists in an organization"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Automated machine learning does not automate workspace provisioning."
    - content: "Automatically run multiple training jobs using different algorithms and parameters to find the best model"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Automated machine learning runs multiple training jobs, varying algorithms and parameters, to find the best model for your data."
