  questions:
  - content: "You want to create a model to predict the cost of heating an office building based on its size in square feet and the number of employees working there. What kind of machine learning problem is this?"
    choices:
    - content: "Regression"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Regression models predict numeric values."
    - content: "Classification"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Classification models predict the class to which an observed case belongs."
    - content: "Clustering"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Clustering models group similar items together."
  - content: "You need to evaluate a classification model. Which metric can you use? ​​"
    choices:
    - content: "Mean squared error (MSE)"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. MSE is used to evaluate regression models."
    - content: "Precision"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Precision is a useful metric for evaluating classification models."
    - content: "Silhouette"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Silhouette is used to evaluate clustering models."
  - content: "In deep learning, what is the purpose of a loss function?"
    choices:
    - content: "To remove data for which no known label values are provided"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A loss function does not remove data."
    - content: "To evaluate the aggregate difference between predicted and actual label values"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. A loss function determines the overall variance, or loss, between predicted and actual label values."
    - content: "To calculate the cost of training a neural network rather than a statistical model"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A loss function does not calculate cost."
