  questions:
  - content: "You want to create a model to predict the cost of heating an office building based on its size in square feet and the number of employees working there. What kind of machine learning problem is this?"
    choices:
    - content: "Regression"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Regression models predict numeric values."
    - content: "Classification"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Classification models predict the class to which an observed case belongs."
    - content: "Clustering"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Clustering models group similar items together."
  - content: "You need to evaluate a classification model. Which metric can you use? ​​"
    choices:
    - content: "Mean squared error (MSE)"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. MSE is used to evaluate regression models."
    - content: "Precision"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Precision is a useful metric for evaluating classification models."
    - content: "Silhouette"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Silhouette is used to evaluate clustering models."
  - content: "In deep learning, what is *loss*?"
    choices:
    - content: "Data deleted from the training set"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Loss is not a measure of deleted data."
    - content: "The difference between predicted and actual label values"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Loss measures the overall variance, or error, between predicted and actual label values."
    - content: "The financial cost of training a model"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Loss is not a financial metric for model training cost."
