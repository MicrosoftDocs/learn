Machine learning is the foundation on which artificial intelligence is built. In this module, you've learned about some of the core principles and concepts on which machine learning is based, and about the different kinds of model you can train and evaluate.

The module also introduced Azure Machine Learning; a cloud platform for end-to-end machine learning operations, and gave you the opportunity to use automated machine learning in Azure Machine Learning for yourself.
