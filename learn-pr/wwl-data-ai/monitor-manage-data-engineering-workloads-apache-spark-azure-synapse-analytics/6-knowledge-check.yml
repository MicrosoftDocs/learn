  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "What is one of the possible ways to optimize an Apache Spark Job?"
    choices:
    - content: "Remove all nodes."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Removing all nodes would mean there is no compute power to process the Apache Spark jobs."
    - content: "Remove the Apache Spark Pool."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Removing the Apache Spark pool removes the capability to process Apache Spark jobs."
    - content: "Use bucketing."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Bucketed tables are optimized because it is a metadata operation about how the data is bucketed and sorted."
  - content: "What can cause a slower performance on join or shuffle jobs?"
    choices:
    - content: "Data skew."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Due to asymmetry in your job data."
    - content: "Enablement of autoscaling"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. When you enable autoscale, you can set a minimum and maximum number of nodes in order to control the scale that you'd like, such that you have flexibility in the number of nodes. It does not relate to performance issues on join or shuffle jobs."
    - content: "Bucketing."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A way to look into slower performance with joins or shuffle jobs is to look into bucketing. The introduction of a bucket column and pre-aggregate in buckets first might help the performance."
