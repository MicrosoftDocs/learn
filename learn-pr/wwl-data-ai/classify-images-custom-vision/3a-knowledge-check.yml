  questions:
  - content: "You plan to use Azure AI Custom Vision to train an image classification model. You want to create a resource that can only be used for model training, and not for prediction. Which kind of resource should you create in your Azure subscription?"
    choices:
    - content: "Custom Vision"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct: When you create a Custom Vision resource, you can specify whether it's to be used for training, prediction, or both."
    - content: "Azure AI services"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect: An Azure AI services resource must be used by the Custom Vision service for both training and prediction."
    - content: "Computer Vision"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect: A Computer Vision resource doesn't support the training of a custom image classification model."
  - content: "You train an image classification model that achieves less than satisfactory evaluation metrics. How might you improve it?"
    choices:
    - content: "Reduce the size of the images used to train the model."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect: Changing the size of the images is unlikely to improve performance significantly, and reducing them may even lose some resolution and make the model worse."
    - content: "Add a new label for \"unknown\" classes."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect: Adding an \"unknown\" label won't improve the accuracy of predictions for the classes you want to identify."
    - content: "Add more images to the training set."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct: Generally, adding more images to the project and retraining the model is likely to improve performance."
  - content: "You have published an image classification model. What information must you provide to developers who want to use it?"
    choices:
    - content: "Only the project ID."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect: The project ID on its own isn't enough information to use the published model"
    - content: "The project ID, the model name, and the key and endpoint for the prediction resource"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct: To use a published model, you need the project ID, the model name, and the key and endpoint for the prediction resource."
    - content: "The project ID, iteration number, and the key and endpoint for the training resource."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect: You need the model name rather than the iteration number; and the key and endpoint must be for the prediction resource, not the training resource."
