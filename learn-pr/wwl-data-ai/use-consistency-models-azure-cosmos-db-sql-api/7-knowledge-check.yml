quiz:
  questions:
  - content: "In the .NET SDK for Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL, which C# class is used to configure session tokens and consistency levels on a per-request basis?"
    choices:
    - content: "``CosmosClientOptions``"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The **CosmosClientOptions** class configures the overall client used in the SDK in multiple operations."
    - content: "``Container``"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The **Container** class contains methods to perform operations on a container, but not a way to configure per-request options."
    - content: "``ItemRequestOptions``"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. The **ItemRequestOptions** class includes multiple properties to configure per-request options."
  - content: "Of the Azure Cosmos DB consistency levels listed, which consistency level has the strongest guarantees for consistency?"
    choices:
    - content: "Bounded staleness"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. The bounded staleness level has strong guarantees with a small threshold allowed for latency."
    - content: "Session"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The session level has weaker consistency guarantees than Bounded staleness outside of the user session."
    - content: "Consistent prefix"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The consistent prefix level has relatively weak consistency and only guarantees that writes will appear in the correct order."
