  questions:
  - content: "You're using Azure Machine Learning designer to create a training pipeline for a binary classification model. You've added a dataset containing features and labels, a Two-Class Decision Forest module, and a Train Model module. You plan to use Score Model and Evaluate Model modules to test the trained model with a subset of the dataset that wasn't used for training. What's another module should you add?"
    choices:
    - content: "Join Data"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Use a Split Data module to randomly split a dataset into test and validation subsets."
    - content: "Split Data"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Use a Split Data module to randomly split a dataset into training and validation subsets."
    - content: "Select Columns in Dataset"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Use a Split Data module to randomly split a dataset into test and validation subsets."
  - content: "You use an Azure Machine Learning designer pipeline to train and test a binary classification model. You review the model's performance metrics in an Evaluate Model module, and note that it has an AUC score of 0.3. What can you conclude about the model?"
    choices:
    - content: "The model can explain 30% of the variance between true and predicted labels."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. An AUC of 0.5 is what you'd expect with random prediction of a binary model."
    - content: "The model predicts accurately for 70% of test cases."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. An AUC of 0.5 is what you'd expect with random prediction of a binary model."
    - content: "The model performs worse than random guessing."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. An AUC of 0.5 is what you'd expect with random prediction of a binary model."
  - content: "You use Azure Machine Learning designer to create a training pipeline for a classification model. What must you do before deploying the model as a service?"
    choices:
    - content: "Create an inference pipeline from the training pipeline"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. You must create an inference pipeline to deploy as a service."
    - content: "Add an Evaluate Model module to the training pipeline"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. You must create an inference pipeline to deploy as a service."
    - content: "Clone the training pipeline with a different name"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. You must create an inference pipeline to deploy as a service."
