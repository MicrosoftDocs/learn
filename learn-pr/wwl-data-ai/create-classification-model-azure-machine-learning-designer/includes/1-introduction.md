Classification is an example of a *supervised* machine learning technique in which you train a model using data that includes both the features and known values for the label, so that the model learns to *fit* the feature combinations to the label. Then, after training has been completed, you can use the trained model to predict labels for new items for which the label is unknown.

You can use Microsoft Azure Machine Learning designer to create classification models by using a drag and drop visual interface, without needing to write any code.

In this module, you'll learn how to:

- Identify classification machine learning scenarios.
- Use Azure Machine Learning designer to train a classification model.
- Use a classification model for inferencing.
- Deploy and test a classification model.        

To complete this module, you'll need a Microsoft Azure subscription. If you don't already have one, you can sign up for a free trial at [https://azure.microsoft.com](https://azure.microsoft.com?azure-portal=true).
