How do companies keep up as industries evolve? The answer is innovation. Even when you “do everything right” with existing business models, you risk losing competitiveness if you don’t embrace disruptive change. The capacity to pivot and foster innovation is essential to long‑term success—leading firms win market share, attract top talent, and create the products and services customers want next.

Today, innovation means staying current with AI. Breakthroughs in prebuilt models and generative AI are making new use cases possible—and faster to implement—than ever before. In this context, automating two or three processes isn’t enough. To stay relevant, organizations need to incorporate AI across the company, empowering every role and process to create value.

This module guides you through a practical, four‑step framework to move beyond pilots and deliver measurable business impact: educate and inspire leaders, assess your AI readiness, map your AI journey, and start building the agentic future. You’ll learn how to align strategy and governance, stand up an operating model that scales safely, and enable business users and subject matter experts to apply AI where it matters most. By the end, you’ll have a clear path from use case to production, with outcomes tied to KPIs and risk managed by design.
