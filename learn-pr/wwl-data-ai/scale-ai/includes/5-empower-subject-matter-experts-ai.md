Human expertise drives business value—creativity, judgment, and deep domain knowledge are things no machine can replicate. At Microsoft, we believe AI should amplify these capabilities, acting as a copilot that helps experts achieve more, not replace them.

Subject matter experts—such as researchers, engineers, financial analysts, and operations specialists—are often closest to the problems AI can solve. With the right tools, they can apply their expertise more effectively without waiting on data science teams.

## Use AI tools to amplify expertise

Modern AI tools make it possible for subject matter experts to work with AI directly, even without technical backgrounds. From SaaS solutions to low-code platforms, these tools help experts:

- Analyze large datasets and uncover insights faster
- Automate repetitive tasks and workflows
- Build custom AI-powered apps without writing code

For example:

- **Researchers** can use AI to summarize scientific literature and test hypotheses faster.
- **Financial analysts** can apply AI models to forecast trends and detect anomalies in real time.
- **Operations managers** can automate scheduling and resource allocation using AI-driven insights.

## Create AI solutions without code

Prebuilt models like GPT are now integrated into everyday tools—Microsoft 365, Dynamics 365, and Bing—so SMEs can start using AI immediately. For more advanced needs, platforms like Microsoft Power Platform and Azure AI Services enable SMEs to create apps, automate processes, and even integrate AI models without writing code.

> [!NOTE]
> Nearly a third of business users have tried to incorporate prebuilt generative AI models such as GPT in their work routines.

For more complex solutions, business users may want to create their own AI models or integrate a model into an app themselves. With no-code tools and platforms such as those provided by Microsoft Power Platform and Azure AI Services, now business users can add AI capabilities to their apps and automate their workflow regardless of their technical expertise.

To explore these capabilities in more depth, see the module [Leverage AI tools and resources for your business](../../leverage-ai-tools?azure-portal=true).

Empowering subject matter experts with AI isn’t just about convenience—it’s a strategic advantage. When SMEs can apply AI directly, organizations accelerate innovation, reduce dependency on technical teams, and unlock faster time-to-value. This approach turns expertise into impact, enabling your business to adapt quickly, seize new opportunities, and stay ahead in a competitive market.
