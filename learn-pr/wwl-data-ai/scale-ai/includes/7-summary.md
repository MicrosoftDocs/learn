You learned a practical, four‑step approach to turn AI pilots into repeatable business value: educate and inspire leaders, assess your AI readiness, map your AI journey, and start building the agentic future. You saw how to align strategy, governance, and operating models—Center of Excellence, guardrails, and data/platform landing zones—to scale safely and measure impact. You also explored how to empower business users and subject matter experts with AI—using prebuilt models and low‑code tools to unlock insights, automate tasks, and speed time‑to‑value. With this foundation, you can prioritize high‑impact use cases, manage risk by design, and create a clear path from use case to production with KPIs that demonstrate results.
