      explanation: "That's incorrect. The number of text values in a dataset can be counted."
    - content: "Count distinct"

      explanation: "That's incorrect. Count distinct can be used to count the number of distinct text values."

  - content: "To uncover the revenue of the New York store in your dataset, what approach would you use?"
    choices:
    - content: "Group the dataset by the Store field, and summarize the Revenue field."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. When you group on the Store field, the summary aggregation can then be applied."
    - content: "Count the number of rows where the Store value is equal to New York."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The aggregation needs to be applied to the Revenue field to return the revenue value."
    - content: "Delete all rows where the store isn't equal to New York and then summarize the Revenue field."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. You don't need to delete the data, you can apply a grouping, and then summarize the data."
  - content: "Which of the following columns in a dataset would be an appropriate use of a color scale indicator?"
    choices:
    - content: "Temperature"
      isCorrect: true

    - content: "LastName"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The LastName column contains string values that wouldn't be suitable for a color scale."
