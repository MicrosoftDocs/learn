Learning Path 4 Tips and Tricks

- Ask students if they can think of examples where document intelligence could make processes more efficient
- Clarify that Azure AI Document Intelligence is the current name for what was previously known as Form Recognizer
- Prepare the knowledge mining solution before the start of class. Students aren't expected to replicate the process of creating a Cognitive Search Index in the exam. This demo’s purpose, like the others, is to give a sense of the capabilities of the service
