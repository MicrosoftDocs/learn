  questions:
  - content: "A data scientist wants to train a model as a command job. Which three things should be referred to in the YAML file?"
    choices:
    - content: "The training script, the dataset, the compute."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That is incorrect. It isn't necessary to refer to the dataset in the job YAML file."
    - content: "The training script, the dataset, the environment."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That is incorrect. It isn't necessary to refer to the dataset in the job YAML file."
    - content: "The training script, the environment, the compute."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That is correct. To submit a job, you need to state what to run (training script), how to run it (environment), and where to run it (compute)."
  - content: "To tune hyperparameters with a sweep job, which compute can be used to train multiple models in parallel?"
    choices:
    - content: "A compute cluster."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That is correct. If a compute cluster can scale up to more than one node, you can train multiple models in parallel."
    - content: "A compute instance."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That is incorrect. It's not possible to train multiple models in parallel on a compute instance."
    - content: "An inference cluster."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That is incorrect. An inference cluster is used for model deployments."
