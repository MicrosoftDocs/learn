Computer vision is a field of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables machines to interpret and understand visual information from the world—such as images, videos, and live camera feeds. Computer vision capabilities support the automation of time-intensive tasks and enable possibilities that did not exist before. 

Consider some of these applications of computer vision:  

- *Manufacturing – Defect Detection*: AI vision systems inspect products on assembly lines in real time. They detect surface defects, misalignments, or missing components using object detection and image segmentation, reducing waste and improving quality control.

- *Healthcare – Medical Imaging Analysis*: Computer vision helps radiologists analyze X-rays, MRIs, and CT scans. AI models can highlight anomalies like tumors or fractures, assist in early diagnosis, and reduce human error.

- *Retail – Shelf Monitoring*: Retailers use AI vision to monitor store shelves. Cameras detect when products are out of stock or misplaced, enabling real-time inventory updates and improving customer experience.

- *Transportation – Autonomous Vehicles*: Self-driving cars rely on computer vision to recognize road signs, lane markings, pedestrians, and other vehicles. This enables safe navigation and decision-making in dynamic environments.

AI vision systems can be created using a range of Azure AI services. In this module we explore **Microsoft Azure AI Vision**, a cloud service that developers can use to create a wide range of computer vision solutions.
