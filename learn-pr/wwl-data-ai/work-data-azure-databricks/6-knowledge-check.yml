quiz:
  questions:
  - content: "Bob has to ingest data in Azure Databricks, coming from multiple data sources. He'll then run some ETLs to move the data into the data lake. Which of his data sources can be mounted under DBFS?"
    choices:
    - content: "FTP"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. FTP or File Transfer Protocol isn't a data source that can be mounted under DBFS."
    - content: "Azure Data Lake Store"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Azure Databricks allows using several data sources: Azure Blob Storage, Azure Data Lake, Cassandra, JDBC, Kafka, Redis, Elasticsearch, files uploaded and mounted via DBFS, as well as data integrations with various other products and databases."
    - content: "SMB"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. SMB or Server Message Block isn't a data source that can be mounted under DBFS."
  - content: "Dataframe `df` needs to be visualized so that the results can be presented to the business users. Which function should be used to plot the data as a bar chart or other type of graph?"
    choices:
    - content: "`df.show()`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The `show` function allows you to print the rows in a dataframe but doesn't give you extra visualization options."
    - content: "`df.describe()`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The `describe` function will return the summary statistics for the columns in our data such as the count, mean, and standard deviation. It doesn't visualize the data."
    - content: "`df.display()`"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. The `display` function will allow you to visualize the data as a table or as a graph of your choosing."
  - content: "Logan is preparing a dataset, which will be used to train a model. It seems like each record appears twice in the table `df`. She wants to delete half of the rows to make sure each observation is only included once. Which function should she use?"
    choices:
    - content: "`df.fillna(2)`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This operation will replace nulls with the value `2`."
    - content: "`df.dropna`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This operation will drop the rows containing null values."
    - content: "`df.dropDuplicates`"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. This operation will drop the duplicate rows."
