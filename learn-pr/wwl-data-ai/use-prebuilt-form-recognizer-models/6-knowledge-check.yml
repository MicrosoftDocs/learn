  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "You have a large set of documents with varying structures that contain customer name and address information. You want to extract entities for each customer. Which prebuilt model should you use?"
    choices:
    - content: "Read model."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The read model can extract text and identify languages but doesn't support entity extraction."
    - content: "General document model."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The general document model is the only one that supports entity extraction."
    - content: "ID document model."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The ID document model extracts information from US drivers' licenses and international passports and doesn't support entities."
  - content: "You are using the prebuilt layout model to analyze a document with many checkboxes. You want to find out whether each box is checked or empty. What object should you use in the returned JSON code?"
    choices:
    - content: "Selection marks."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Selection marks record checkboxes and radio buttons and include whether they're selected or not."
    - content: "Bounding boxes."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Bounding boxes record the size and position of an element in the analyzed document."
    - content: "Confidence indicators."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Confidence indicators show how reliable an extracted value is."
  - content: "You submit a Word document to the Azure AI Document Intelligence general document model for analysis but you receive an error. The file is A4 size, contains 1 MB of data, and is not password-protected. How should you resolve the error?"
    choices:
    - content: "Change from the free tier to the standard tier."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The free tier supports documents up to 4 MB in size. This change would not resolve the error."
    - content: "Submit the document one page at a time."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. It's possible but not necessary to submit multipage documents one page at a time. This change would not resolve the error."
    - content: "Convert the document to PDF format."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Word documents are not supported by Azure AI Document Intelligence but PDF documents are supported. Azure AI Document Intelligence is designed to analyze scanned and photographed paper documents, not documents that are already in a digital format so you should consider using another technology to extract the data in Word documents."
