In this module, you explored how Microsoft Foundry supports the full lifecycle of building generative AI and agentic solutions. You learned how language models serve as the foundation for AI applications, and how Foundry provides the tools and governance needed to use these models effectively and responsibly.

You began by examining the Foundry model catalog, a centralized environment for discovering and comparing foundation models from Microsoft, partners, and open-source communities. You then learned how to deploy models to make them available as stable, scalable API endpoints. 

The module also introduced lightweight client applications, which offer a simple way to connect to deployed models using the Foundry SDK. You learned how a minimal Python script can authenticate to a Foundry project, send prompts to a model, and retrieve responses.

You then moved beyond raw models and learned how to build agents in Foundry. Agents package a model together with instructions, tools, and optional knowledge sources to produce workflow-oriented, repeatable behavior. The module showed how to configure and test agents in the playground, then publish them as Azure resources with stable endpoints. You now have the foundation needed to begin building scalable, secure AI applications powered by modern generative and agentic technologies.
