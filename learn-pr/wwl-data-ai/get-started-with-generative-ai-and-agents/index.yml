summary: "Learn how to use generative AI models and agents with Microsoft Foundry."
abstract: |
  By the end of this module, you'll be able to:
  - Describe how an agent encapsulates model behavior using system instructions and tools
  - Identify the right model for a task using the Foundry model catalog
  - Deploy a model in the Foundry portal and replicate Playground settings in code
  - Create and test an agent in the Foundry portal
  - Use an agent in the Playground to validate prompts and behavior
  - Call an agent from code using the Foundry Project API
prerequisites: A basic understanding of machine learning and generative AI concepts.
