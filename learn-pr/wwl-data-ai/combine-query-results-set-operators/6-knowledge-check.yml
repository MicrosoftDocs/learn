  questions:
  - content: "When combining the output of two sets, how does UNION and UNION all treat NULL values?"
    choices:
    - content: "Rows that contain NULL values aren't returned because NULL values can't be compared."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. UNION and UNION ALL will return rows that contain NULL values."
    - content: "NULLs represent unknown values and can't be compared. UNION and UNION ALL will return an error if sets contain NULLs."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. UNION and UNION ALL won't return an error if the result sets being compared include NULLs."
    - content: "A NULL in one set is treated as being equal to a NULL in another set."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. NULLs are compared and treated as duplicates if they appear in both sets."
  - content: "There are employee and customer query result sets, both of which containID(int) and country/region(nvarchar(20)) columns. Someone wants to return a list of countries/regions that appear in both result sets. Which set operator should they use?"
    choices:
    - content: "EXCEPT"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The EXCEPT set operator returns rows that are in one result set, but not the other."
    - content: "INTERSECT"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. The INTERSECT set operator returns rows that are in both result sets."
    - content: "OUTER APPLY"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. OUTER APPLY is a table operator returns rows from two result sets."
  - content: "What type of result does the APPLY operator return?"
    choices:
    - content: "Table-valued"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. APPLY returns a table-valued result rather than a scalar or multi-valued result."
    - content: "Scalar"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Scalar functions return one single value."
    - content: "Aggregate"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Aggregates return single values similar to SUM() or COUNT()."
