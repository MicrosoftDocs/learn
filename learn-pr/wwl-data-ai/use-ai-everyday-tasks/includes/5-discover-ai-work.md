[Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat](https://m365.cloud.microsoft/chat) is a shared chat experience within Microsoft 365 Copilot, and is available at no additional cost with eligible Microsoft 365 and Office 365 licenses. With a Microsoft 365 Copilot license, Copilot Chat becomes more powerful by connecting to your work data across Microsoft 365 applications like Teams, Word, Outlook, PowerPoint, and Excel. This helps connect your questions with business information and apps, bringing out important details from the company's data.

Some common examples include:

- **Outlook**: Summarize the content of a large email thread.
- **PowerPoint**: Turn a text-heavy slide into concise bullet points for greater clarity.
- **Word**: Rewrite a paragraph in a different tone or style.
- **Teams**: Summarize meetings and chat threads.
