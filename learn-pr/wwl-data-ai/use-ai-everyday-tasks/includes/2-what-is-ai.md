AI can simplify everyday tasks and enhance productivity. This unit introduces the basics of AI, including how generative AI creates new content, and how tools like Microsoft Copilot can enhance productivity. You also explore the importance of using AI responsibly to ensure fairness, transparency, and trust.

## What is AI, and how does it work?

Generative AI focuses on creating new, unique content, based on the input you provide. This input is called **prompting**, which just means asking AI for specific things. Generative AI can even produce creative content, such as writing poems, composing melodies, or designing graphics, based on the patterns and styles it learned from existing data. 

People usually interact with generative AI built into a chat application. One example of such an application is [Microsoft Copilot](https://copilot.microsoft.com?azure-portal=true), an AI-powered productivity tool designed to enhance your work experience by providing real-time intelligence and assistance. In other words, it's a smart tool that helps you work better by giving you quick answers and help when you need it.

> Generative AI uses **large language models (LLMs)**, which are AI systems trained on massive amounts of text, to understand and generate human-like language. They are like a very intelligent autocomplete. LLMs are a type of AI model that uses **natural language processing (NLP)** techniques to work.

## Responsible AI

AI should treat everyone fairly, protect privacy, and operate transparently. This helps build trust and ensures that AI systems are used in ways that respect individuals' rights and interests. In this short video, learn about some of the challenges and solutions related to AI accuracy.

As AI becomes more integrated into our daily lives, it's important to use it responsibly. Here are some ways you can help keep your AI-generated content fair, trustworthy, and beneficial to society:

- **Provide clear and specific prompts**. Avoid sensitive topics and always review and validate outputs for accuracy and relevance.
- **Watch for common biases**:
    - **Gender bias**. AI systems can perpetuate gender stereotypes if trained on biased data. For example, a hiring algorithm might favor male candidates over female candidates due to historical data biases.
    - **Racial bias**. AI systems can exhibit racial bias, leading to discriminatory outcomes. For instance, facial recognition systems might have higher error rates for people of color compared to white individuals.
    - **Socioeconomic bias**. AI systems can favor individuals from higher socioeconomic backgrounds. A credit scoring algorithm, for example, might disproportionately favor applicants from wealthier neighborhoods.

Now that you have an idea of what generative AI is, how it can enhance our productivity and creativity, and the ethical considerations of using it, let's explore how to interact with AI through prompting.
