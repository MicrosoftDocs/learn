quiz:
  questions:
  - content: "What are some benefits of using Azure OpenAI to generate code?"
    choices:
    - content: "Increase in efficiency and productivity"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Azure OpenAI can make you more efficient and productive by generating code for you."
    - content: "Increase in bugs and readability"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Azure OpenAI can make you more efficient and productive by generating code for you."
    - content: "Increase in time spent coding"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Azure OpenAI can make you more efficient and productive by generating code for you."
  - content: "What is the purpose of providing more context to the Azure OpenAI model when completing partial code?"
    choices:
    - content: "Providing more context makes the model less accurate."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Providing more context makes the model more accurate."
    - content: "Providing more context doesn't affect the accuracy of the model."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Providing more context makes the model more accurate."
    - content: "The more context provided to the model, the more accurate the response likely is."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The more context provided to the model, the more accurate the response likely is."
  - content: "What is an example of how Azure OpenAI models can change coding language?"
    choices:
    - content: "Azure OpenAI models can only translate code from one language to another if the code is written in C#."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Azure OpenAI models can translate code from one language to another regardless of the original language."
    - content: "If you have code in one language, but need it in another, Azure OpenAI can translate that for you in several languages."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Azure OpenAI models can translate code from one language to another regardless of the original language."
    - content: "Azure OpenAI models can only translate code from Python to C# or Java."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Azure OpenAI models can translate code from one language to another regardless of the original language."
