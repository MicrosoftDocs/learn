Azure Databricks provides a notebook-oriented Apache Spark as-a-service workspace environment. It is the most feature-rich hosted service available to run Spark workloads in Azure. Apache Spark is a unified analytics engine for large-scale data processing and machine learning.

Suppose you work with Big Data as a data engineer or a data scientist, and you must process data that you can describe as having one or more of the following characteristics:

1. High volume - You must process an extremely large volume of data and need to scale out your compute accordingly
1. High velocity - You require streaming and real-time processing capabilities
1. Variety - Your data types are varied, from structured relational data sets and financial transactions to unstructured data such as chat and SMS messages, IoT devices, images, logs, MRIs, etc.

> These characteristics are oftentimes called the "3 Vs of Big Data".

When it comes to working with Big Data in a unified way, whether you process it real time as it arrives or in batches, Apache Spark provides a fast and capable engine that also supports data science processes, like machine learning and advanced analytics.
