title: Build Generative AI applications with Azure Cosmos DB
summary: Build advanced Generative AI application with Python and Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL.
abstract: |
  After completing this module, you'll be able to:
  - Build a Generative AI application capable of interacting with private data using Python and Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL.
  - Efficiently retrieve and store vectors in Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL.
  - Perform similarity searches using Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL.
  - Integrate data and AI models using LangChain orchestration to create intelligent and adaptable Generative AI application.
prerequisites: |
  Before starting this module, you should have a basic understanding of Python development, Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL, working with AI models, and understand the concepts associated with retrieval augmented generated (RAG) patterns.
