The Text Analytics API can detect a wide range of languages, variants, dialects, and some regional/cultural languages. Language detection is useful for content stores that collect arbitrary text, where language is unknown. You can parse the results of this analysis to determine which language is used in the input document. Use language detection in scenarios where language in some input, is not known ahead of time.  A good example is a chat bot that is deployed for use around the world.  Detecting the language used by the person interacting with the chat bot, allows you to configure the appropriate language for a response.
