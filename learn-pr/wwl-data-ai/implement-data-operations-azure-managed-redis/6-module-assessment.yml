quiz:
  questions:
  - content: "What is the default TLS connection port for Azure Managed Redis?"
    choices:
    - content: "10000"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Azure Managed Redis uses port 10000 as the default connection port for TLS connections."
    - content: "6379"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Port 6379 is the default non-TLS port for Azure Cache for Redis instances."
    - content: "6380"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Port 6380 is used by Azure Cache for Redis instances, not Azure Managed Redis."
  - content: "Which Redis command should you avoid using in production environments for iterating over keys?"
    choices:
    - content: "KEYS"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "The KEYS command should be avoided in production because it blocks the server while scanning all keys. Use SCAN instead for non-blocking iteration."
    - content: "SCAN"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "SCAN is the recommended command for iterating over keys in production as it's non-blocking."
    - content: "EXISTS"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "EXISTS is safe to use in production for checking if specific keys exist."
  - content: "Which redis-py method sets a key with an expiration time in a single atomic operation?"
    choices:
    - content: "`setex()`"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "The `setex()` method sets a value and expiration time in a single atomic operation, making it efficient and reliable."
    - content: "`expire()`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The `expire()` method only adds expiration to an existing key; it doesn't set the key value itself."
    - content: "`set()`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The `set()` method only stores a key-value pair without expiration. You'd need a separate `expire()` call, which isn't atomic."
  - content: "What does a TTL value of -1 indicate when checking key expiration in Redis?"
    choices:
    - content: "Key exists but has no expiration set"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "A TTL value of -1 means the key exists in Redis but has no expiration time set, so it persists indefinitely."
    - content: "Key doesn't exist"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "A TTL value of -2 indicates that the key doesn't exist, not -1."
    - content: "Key expired 1 second ago"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Negative TTL values have special meanings in Redis; they don't represent time in the past."
