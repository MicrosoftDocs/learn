In this exercise, you create an Azure Managed Redis resource and build a Python console application that performs common data operations using the **redis-py** library. You work with Redis hash data structures to store and retrieve key-value pairs, manage key expiration with Time-To-Live (TTL) settings, and delete keys from the cache. 

Tasks performed in this exercise:

- Download the project starter files
- Create an Azure Managed Redis resource
- Add code to the starter files to complete the console app
- Run the console app to perform data operations

This exercise takes approximately **30** minutes to complete.
