In this module, you learned about Azure Managed Redis capabilities and caching strategies, including data caching, content caching, and session storage patterns. You also explored client libraries and development best practices, including how to choose the right library based on clustering policies and handle blocked commands. Additionally, you learned how to implement data operations using the redis-py Python library, including basic operations, expiration management, and cache invalidation patterns. Finally, you built a Python application that performs data operations with Azure Managed Redis, applying connection management and error handling techniques.
