DP-900: Learning Path 3 Explore fundamentals of nonrelational data in Azure

As you're preparing to teach this learning path, get familiar with what the students learn during the learning path. In this learning path, students explore the characteristics of nonrelational data. Students also learn about the different types of nonrelational data and nonrelational database management systems. 

This learning path consists of two lessons: 

- Lesson 1 – Explore Azure storage for nonrelational data 

- Lesson 2 – Explore fundamentals of Azure Cosmos database

This learning path consists of four focus areas: 

- Focus on the fundamental concepts of Azure Storage, this is the foundation for more advanced topics 

- Explore the critical role of Azure Data Lake Storage in managing extensive data volumes in the cloud 

- Create a hierarchical file system, and upload large datasets, emphasizing cloud convenience and scalability 

- Highlight the global distribution capabilities of Cosmos database (DB), explaining how data replication across Azure regions enables low-latency access for global users 

Learning Path 3 Tips and Tricks 

- Encourage hands-on learning with Data Lake Storage and Cosmos DB 

- Relate concepts to real scenarios for practical understanding 

- Encourage students to explore Cosmos DB's multiple APIs for language flexibility
