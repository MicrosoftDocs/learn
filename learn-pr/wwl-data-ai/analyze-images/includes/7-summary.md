In this module, you learned how to provision an Azure Vision resource and use it from a client application to analyze images.

You can use Azure Vision's image analysis capabilities in scenarios that require information extraction or inference from images. A common use case is digital asset management (DAM), in which you need to tag, catalog, and index image-based data.

To learn more about image analysis with the Azure Vision service, see the [Azure Vision documentation](/azure/ai-services/computer-vision/overview-image-analysis?azure-portal=true).
