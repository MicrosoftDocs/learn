Computer Vision is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) in which software interprets visual input, often from images or video feeds. In Microsoft Azure, you can use the **Azure AI Vision** service to implement multiple computer vision scenarios, including:

- Image analysis
- Optical character recognition (OCR)
- Face detection and analysis
- Video analysis

In this module, we'll focus on *image analysis*, and explore how to build applications that use the Azure AI Vision service to analyze and extract and infer insights from images.

As shown in this conceptual diagram, the Azure AI Vision service provides services that you can use to analyze images and:

1. Generate a *caption* for an image based on its contents.
2. Suggest appropriate *tags* to associate with an image.
3. Detect and locate common *objects* in an image.
4. Detect and locate *people* in an image.
