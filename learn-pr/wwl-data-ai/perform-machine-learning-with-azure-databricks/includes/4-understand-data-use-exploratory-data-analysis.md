In your Azure Databricks workspace, open the **ml** folder that you imported within your user folder.

Open the **3. Exploratory Analysis** notebook. Make sure you attach your cluster to the notebook before following the instructions and running the cells within.

Within the notebook, you will:

- Identify the main objectives of exploratory analysis
- Calculate statistical moments to determine the center and spread of data
- Create plots of data including histograms and scatterplots
- Calculate correlations between variables
- Explore more advanced plots to visualize the relation between variables

After you've completed the notebook, return to this screen, and continue to the next step.
