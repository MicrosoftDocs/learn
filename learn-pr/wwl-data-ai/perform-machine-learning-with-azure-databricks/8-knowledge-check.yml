  questions:
  - content: "What method is used in Python cells to display the results as a formatted table or chart visualization?"
    choices:
    - content: "display(df)"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "This is the correct syntax for rendering the output of the cell as a formatted table or chart."
    - content: "df.display()"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This syntax is invalid."
    - content: "print(df)"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The print method will display the dataframe as a text only table, but not a formatted table."
  - content: "What method is used to calculate the correlation between two columns in a dataframe (df)?"
    choices:
    - content: "correlation(df, 'col1', 'col2')"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This syntax is invalid."
    - content: "df.corr('col1', 'col2')"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This syntax is invalid."
    - content: "df.stat.corr('col1', 'col2')"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "This is the correct syntax for calculating correlation between two columns in a dataframe."
  - content: "Which of these best describes the purpose of training data?"
    choices:
    - content: "A subset of the data used to \"test\" what the algorithm has learned."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This is not the purpose of training data."
    - content: "The dataset used in its entirety to \"teach\" the algorithm."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Only a subset of the complete dataset should be used for training data."
    - content: "A subset of the data used to \"teach\" the algorithm. This is the data that the algorithm will learn from."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "This is the best description."
  - content: "Mean Squared Error (MSE) is a common evaluation metric in regression tasks. Select the option that apply for MSE?"
    choices:
    - content: "MSE can be any real number."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "MSE, by definition, is assured to be always positive."
    - content: "Lower the MSE, the better the model is performing."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Lower MSE indicates lower overall error in model predictions."
    - content: "Higher the MSE, the better the model is performing."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Higher MSE indicates higher overall error in model predictions."
