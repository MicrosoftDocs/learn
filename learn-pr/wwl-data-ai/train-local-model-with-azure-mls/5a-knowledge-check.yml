  questions:
  - content: "You want to use a script-based experiment to train a PyTorch model, setting the batch size and learning rate hyperparameters to specified values each time the experiment runs. What should you do?"
    choices:
    - content: "Create multiple script files â€“ one for each batch size and learning rate combination you want to use."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. To use different values each time, define arguments in the script and pass them using the arguments parameter of the ScriptRunConfig."
    - content: "Set the batch_size and learning_rate properties of the ScriptRunConfig before running the experiment."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. To use different values each time, define arguments in the script and pass them using the arguments parameter of the ScriptRunConfig."
    - content: "Add arguments for batch size and learning rate to the script, and set them in the arguments property of the ScriptRunConfig."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. To use different values each time, define arguments in the script and pass them using the arguments parameter of the ScriptRunConfig."
  - content: "You have run an experiment to train a model. You want the model to be stored in the workspace, and available to other experiments and published services. What should you do?"
    choices:
    - content: "Register the model in the workspace."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. To store a model in the workspace, register it."
    - content: "Save the model as a file in a Compute Instance."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. To store a model in the workspace, register it."
    - content: "Save the experiment script as a notebook."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. To store a model in the workspace, register it."
