Cosmos DB NoSQL in Fabric is designed to support operational workloads that require fast, scalable, and secure access to data. In this unit, you explore how Cosmos DB NoSQL in Fabric can be used in various real-world scenarios to support application development and data-driven solutions. Let's review a few examples of how Cosmos DB NoSQL in Fabric can be used to build operational workloads.

## Scenario: AI-Powered knowledge assistant

A product team wants to build a knowledge assistant that can help employees find relevant information from internal documentation. They store product manuals, support articles, and chat transcripts as JSON documents in Cosmos DB NoSQL in Fabric. The team would then add vector indexing, allowing the assistant to retrieve semantically similar documents based on a userâ€™s query. The vector indexes enable the assistant to return relevant content quickly and accurately. The team benefits from fast iteration and deployment, and mirrored data in OneLake supports usage analytics and content optimization.

## Scenario: Customer profile store

A financial services provider builds a customer profile store using Cosmos DB NoSQL in Fabric. Each profile includes transaction history, preferences, and risk scores. The application queries this data to personalize offers and detect unusual activity. The database supports flexible document structures and fast access to customer data. Mirrored data is used to analyze customer behavior and improve service delivery.

These examples are just a few of the many ways Cosmos DB NoSQL in Fabric can be used to build operational workloads. The service's flexibility, performance, and integration with other Fabric services make it a powerful tool for developers and data engineers.
