In this module, you learned about Cosmos DB NoSQL in Fabric, a fully managed NoSQL database based on Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL. This database enables the easy construction of operational databases directly in Fabric and supports the NoSQL API. You also learned about its authentication methods, which include Microsoft Entra authentication, managed identity, and service principal. In this module, you created a Cosmos DB NoSQL database in Fabric, added data to a container, queried the data using Data Explorer, and reviewed the connection information for SDK access.

The main takeaways from this module include the robust security, access control, and monitoring features of Cosmos DB NoSQL in Fabric. It uses Microsoft Entra as the primary authentication method and applies consistent access controls and network security settings across all workspaces. The database encrypts data at rest and features zone-redundancy for high availability and disaster recovery. Additionally, the module highlighted the versatility of Cosmos DB NoSQL in Fabric, detailing its integration with various services across the platform for data movement, analysis, and application development.
