The technological research and consulting firm Gartner defines four common types of analytical technique that organizations commonly use:

- **Descriptive analytics**, which answers the question “What is happening in my business?”. The data to answer this question is typically answered through the creation of a data warehouse in which historical data is persisted in relational tables for multidimensional modeling and reporting.
- **Diagnostic analytics**, which deals with answering the question “Why is it happening?”. This may involve exploring information that already exists in a data warehouse, but typically involves a wider search of your data estate to find more data to support this type of analysis.
- **Predictive analytics**, which enables you to answer the question “What is likely to happen in the future based on previous trends and patterns?”
- **Prescriptive analytics**, which enables autonomous decision making based on real-time or near real-time analysis of data, using predictive analytics.
