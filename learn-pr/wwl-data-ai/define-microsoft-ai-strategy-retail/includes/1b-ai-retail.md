Retailers face growing pressure to deliver personalized customer experiences, optimize supply chains, and manage costs—all while responding to rapidly changing consumer behaviors and market conditions. Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming this landscape by enabling smarter decisions, faster innovation, and more connected shopping journeys.

Microsoft AI, powered by the Microsoft Cloud for Retail, brings together advanced analytics, generative AI, and secure cloud services to address these challenges. Across merchandising, operations, and customer engagement, AI helps organizations:

These capabilities are built on a foundation of trust, compliance, and interoperability—critical for retailers operating across diverse markets and regulations. By embedding AI into existing workflows, leaders can accelerate innovation without disrupting operations.
