The current AI revolution is transforming the behavior and expectations of businesses, markets, and customers. The retail sector has a lot at stake in this context. Experts estimate generative AI on its own will increase revenue 400-600 billion USD a year for **retail and consumer goods** companies.<sup>1</sup> The total business value of all AI technologies will likely be even higher. This module discusses how your retail organization can benefit from this context and adopt profitable retail use cases. It explains common scenarios where AI can generate business value in the sector.

The next step for adopting AI is to find the tools that best fit your organization’s needs. This module discusses the available options in the **Microsoft AI** catalog. It specifies which products enable each of the use cases and which expertise is required to manage them. Most Microsoft everyday apps incorporate AI features for business users to benefit from this technology without prior technical expertise. For example, you can use generative AI embedded in Microsoft 365 products, and other Microsoft products allow developers to build tailored solutions. For instance, you can work directly with the generative AI models in Azure OpenAI Services. You can discover more details about Microsoft AI products and services in the [“Leverage AI tools and resources for your business”](/training/modules/leverage-ai-tools) module.

Every AI implementation must consider **responsible AI** and practices. Microsoft AI follows very **[high ethical standards](https://www.microsoft.com/ai/responsible-ai)**. According to these principles, AI solutions must comply with fairness, reliability, privacy, security, inclusivity, transparency, and accountability guidelines.
