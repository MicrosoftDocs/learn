Custom models in Azure AI Vision allow you to train an AI model to classify images or detect objects in images.

*Image classification* is a common computer vision problem that requires software to analyze an image in order to categorize (or *classify*) it. In this module, you'll learn how the **Azure AI Vision** service enables you to build your own custom vision models for image classification.

*Object detection* is another common computer vision problem that requires software to identify the location of specific classes of object in an image. Creating an object detection project follows the same pattern as an image classification project, from creation through labeling and training. This module covers concepts and considerations for object detection, however the exercise focuses on classification.
