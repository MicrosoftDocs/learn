As generative AI models become more powerful and ubiquitous, their use has grown beyond simple "chat" applications to power intelligent *agents* that can operate autonomously to automate tasks. Increasingly, organizations are using generative AI models to build agents that orchestrate business processes and coordinate workloads in ways that were previously unimaginable.

This module discusses some of the core concepts related to AI agents, and introduces some of the technologies that developers can use to build agentic solutions on Microsoft Azure.
