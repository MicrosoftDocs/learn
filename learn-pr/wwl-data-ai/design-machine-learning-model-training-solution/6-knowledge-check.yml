quiz:
  questions:
  - content: "Which compute would you recommend to train the model?"
    choices:
    - content: "Spark cluster"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Since the data scientists aren't familiar with Spark, it's not the preferred solution right now."
    - content: "CPU"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. CPU compute is the best option for training the model. There can be a need for GPU or Spark when model training takes too long, but for now it's best to start with CPUs."
    - content: "GPU"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. There's no indication yet that GPUs are needed to train the model, and using GPUs over CPUs now, only incurs unnecessary extra costs."
  - content: "What type of predictions does the mobile application need to generate?"
    choices:
    - content: "Real-time predictions"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. There's a need for immediate predictions for individual patients."
    - content: "Batch predictions"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Batch predictions would take too long. We need immediate predictions."
    - content: "Local predictions"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. There's a need for immediate predictions for individual patients so we need real-time predictions."
