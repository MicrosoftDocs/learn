The Speech-to-Text aspect of the Speech service transcribes audio streams into text. Your application can display this text to the user or act upon it as command input. You can use this service either with an SDK client library (for supported platforms and languages) or a representational state transfer (REST) API. 

With the Speech Service, you can:

- Extend the reach of your applications across mobile, desktop, and web to provide speech-to-text transcription.
- Easily translate to and from multiple, supported languages through the open REST interface of the Speech SDK. This API is a cloud-based automatic speech-translation service (also known as machine translation).
- Perform Text-to-Speech operations that can accept text input and then output a spoken version of that text, using synthesized speech.
- Perform entity recognition through integration with Language Understanding (LUIS)
