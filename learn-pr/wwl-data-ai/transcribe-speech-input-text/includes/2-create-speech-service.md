Before you can use the Azure AI Speech service, you need to create a Azure AI Speech resource in your Azure subscription. You can use either a dedicated **Speech** resource or a multi-service **Azure AI Services** resource.

After creating your Azure resource, you will need the following information to use it from a client application through one of the supported SDKs:

- The *location* in which the resource is deployed (for example, *eastus*)
- One of the *keys* assigned to your resource.

You can view of these values on the **Keys and Endpoint** page for your resource in the Azure portal.
