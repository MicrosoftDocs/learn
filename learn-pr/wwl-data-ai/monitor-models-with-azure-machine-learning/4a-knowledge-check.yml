      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That is correct. To enable telemetry analysis though Application Insights, you must enable Application Insights for the service."
    - content: "Move the AKS cluster to the same region as the Azure Machine Learning workspace."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That is incorrect. To enable telemetry analysis though Application Insights, you must enable Application Insights for the service."
  - content: "You want to include custom information in the telemetry for your inferencing service, and analyze it using Application Insights. What must you do in your service's entry script?"
    choices:
    - content: "Use the Run.log method to log the custom metrics."
