SQL windowing operations allow you to define a subset of rows from a result set and apply functions against those rows. Window functions allow you to perform operations such as assign a rank order to a row or divide a result set into different parts. Once you understand how window functions work, you can use them in place of constructs such as self-joins or temporary tables.

After completing this module, you’ll be able to:

- Describe window functions. 
- Use the OVER clause.
- Use RANK, AGGREGATE, and OFFSET functions.
