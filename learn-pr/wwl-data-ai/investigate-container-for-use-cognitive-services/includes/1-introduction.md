Containers enable you to host Azure Azure AI Services either on-premises or on Azure. For example, if your application uses sensitive data in an on-premises SQL Server to call an Azure AI service, you can deploy Azure AI Services in containers on the same network. Now your data can stay on your local network and not be passed to the cloud. Deploying Azure AI Services in a container on-premises will also decrease the latency between the service and your local data, which can improve performance.

In this module, you'll learn how to:

- Understand containers.
- Provision and use an Azure AI Services container.
