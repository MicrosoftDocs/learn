  questions:
  - content: "What is one of the primary benefits of using custom tools in Azure AI Agent Service?"  
    choices:  
    - content: "They eliminate the need for any coding knowledge."  
      isCorrect: false  
      explanation: "Incorrect. While custom tools simplify many processes, some level of coding knowledge may still be required for advanced configurations."  
    - content: "They enhance productivity by automating repetitive tasks."  
      isCorrect: true  
      explanation: "Correct. Custom tools in Azure AI services can automate repetitive tasks, saving time and resources, which enhance productivity."  
    - content: "They provide free access to all Azure AI services."  
      isCorrect: false
