In this module, we covered the benefits of integrating custom tools into Azure AI Agent Service to boost productivity and provide tailored business solutions. By providing custom tools to our agent, we can optimize processes to meet specific needs, resulting in better responses from your agent.

The techniques learned in this module enable businesses to generate marketing materials, improve communications, and analyze market trends more effectively, all through custom tools. The integration of various tool options in the AI Agent Service, from Azure Functions to OpenAPI specifications, allows for the creation of intelligent, event-driven applications that use well-established patterns already used in many businesses.
