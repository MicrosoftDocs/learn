Azure AI Agent Service offers a seamless way to build an agent without needing extensive AI or machine learning expertise. By using tools, you can provide your agent with functionality to execute actions on your behalf.

The AI Agent Service provides built-in tools for gathering knowledge and generating code, which provide your agent with some powerful functionality. However, sometimes your agent needs to be able to complete specific tasks or actions that an AI model would struggle to handle on its own. To accomplish these actions, you can provide your agent a *custom tool* based on your own code or a third-party service or API.

Imagine you're working in the retail industry, and your company is struggling with managing customer inquiries efficiently. The customer support team is overwhelmed with repetitive questions, leading to delays in response times and decreased customer satisfaction. By using Azure AI Agent Service with custom tools, you can create a custom FAQ agent that handles common inquiries. This agent can be provided with a set of custom tools to look up customer orders, freeing up your support team to focus on more complex issues.

In this module, you'll learn how to utilize custom tools in Azure AI Agent Service to enhance productivity, improve accuracy, and create tailored solutions for specific needs.
