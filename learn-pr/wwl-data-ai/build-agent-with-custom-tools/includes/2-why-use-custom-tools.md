Azure AI Agent Service offers a powerful platform for integrating custom tools to enhance productivity and provide tailored solutions for specific business needs. By using these custom tools, businesses can achieve greater efficiency and effectiveness in their operations.

## Why use custom tools?

Custom tools in Azure AI services can significantly enhance productivity by automating repetitive tasks and streamlining workflows that are specific to your use case. These tools improve accuracy by providing precise and consistent outputs, reducing the likelihood of human error. Additionally, custom tools offer tailored solutions that address specific business needs, enabling organizations to optimize their processes and achieve better outcomes.

- **Enhanced productivity**: Automate repetitive tasks and streamline workflows.
- **Improved accuracy**: Provide precise and consistent outputs, reducing human error.
- **Tailored solutions**: Address specific business needs and optimize processes.

Adding tools makes custom functionality available for the agent to use, depending on how it decides to respond to the user prompt. For example, consider how a custom tool to retrieve weather data from an external meteorological service could be used by an agent.

The diagram shows the process of an agent choosing to use the custom tool:

1. A user asks an agent about the weather conditions in a ski resort.
2. The agent determines that it has access to a tool that can use an API to get meteorological information, and calls it.
3. The tool returns the weather report, and the agent informs the user.

## Common scenarios for custom tools in agents

Custom tools within the Azure AI Agent Service enable users to extend the capabilities of AI agents, tailoring them to meet specific business needs. Some example use cases that illustrate the versatility and impact of custom tools include:

### Customer support automation

- **Scenario**: A retail company integrates a custom tool that connects the Azure AI Agent to their customer relationship management (CRM) system.
- **Functionality**: The AI agent can retrieve customer order histories, process refunds, and provide real-time updates on shipping statuses.
- **Outcome**: Faster resolution of customer queries, reduced workload for support teams, and improved customer satisfaction.

### Inventory management

- **Scenario**: A manufacturing company develops a custom tool to link the AI agent with their inventory management system.
- **Functionality**: The AI agent can check stock levels, predict restocking needs using historical data, and place orders with suppliers automatically.
- **Outcome**: Streamlined inventory processes and optimized supply chain operations.

### Healthcare appointment scheduling

- **Scenario**: A healthcare provider integrates a custom scheduling tool with the AI agent.
- **Functionality**: The AI agent can access patient records, suggest available appointment slots, and send reminders to patients.
- **Outcome**: Reduced administrative burden, improved patient experience, and better resource utilization.

### IT Helpdesk support

- **Scenario**: An IT department develops a custom tool to integrate the AI agent with their ticketing and knowledge base systems.
- **Functionality**: The AI agent can troubleshoot common technical issues, escalate complex problems, and track ticket statuses.
- **Outcome**: Faster issue resolution, reduced downtime, and improved employee productivity.

### E-learning and training

- **Scenario**: An educational institution creates a custom tool to connect the AI agent with their learning management system (LMS).
- **Functionality**: The AI agent can recommend courses, track student progress, and answer questions about course content.
- **Outcome**: Enhanced learning experiences, increased student engagement, and streamlined administrative tasks.

These examples demonstrate how custom tools within the Azure AI Agent Service can be used across industries to address unique challenges, drive efficiency, and deliver value.
