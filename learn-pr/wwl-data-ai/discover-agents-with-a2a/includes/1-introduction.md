AI agents are powerful on their own, but many real-world tasks require collaboration across multiple agents. Coordinating these interactions manually can be complex, especially when agents are remote or distributed.

The Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol addresses this challenge by providing a standardized framework for agent discovery, communication, and coordinated task execution. By implementing A2A, you can easily manage connections to remote agents, delegate requests to the appropriate agent, and enables seamless communication between agents in a standardized, secure way.

For example, imagine a technical writer who wants to create compelling blog content. One agent generates compelling article hadlines, while another creates detailed outlines. Using A2A, a routing agent coordinates the workflow: it sends the user's request to the title agent, passes the generated title to the outline agent, and returns the final outline to the userâ€”all automatically.

In this module, you will learn how to implement the A2A protocol with Azure AI Agents, configure a routing agent, register remote agents, and build a coordinated workflow that allows multiple agents to collaborate effectively.
