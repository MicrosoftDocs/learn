In this module, you learned how to connect Python clients to Azure AI Agents using the Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol.

By running an A2A server and connecting your client, you explored how agents are discovered and communicated with dynamically using the Agent Card. You learned about executors, which handle agent requests, and how messages—both streaming and non-streaming—flow between clients and agents. Understanding these concepts allows you to build flexible, discoverable agent networks that can delegate tasks and respond to requests across distributed environments.
