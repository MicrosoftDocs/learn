  questions:
  - content: "What is the primary purpose of implementing version control in Azure Databricks?"
    choices:
    - content: "To increase the processing speed of data pipelines."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While efficient code management can indirectly improve performance, the primary purpose of version control is not to increase processing speed."
    - content: "To enhance the visual appeal of the Databricks interface."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The implementation of version control does not directly affect the visual appeal of the Databricks interface."
    - content: "To manage code changes, collaborate with team members, and maintain the integrity of data pipelines and machine learning models."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Implementing version control allows for effective code management, collaboration, and maintenance of data pipelines and machine learning models."
  - content: "What is the purpose of unit testing in Azure Databricks?"
    choices:
    - content: "To validate individual components or functions of the codebase in isolation."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Unit testing focuses on validating individual components or functions of the codebase in isolation."
    - content: "To verify the interactions between different modules and services."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This is the purpose of integration testing, not unit testing."
    - content: "To simulate data ingestion, transformation, and storage."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This is an example of a process that might be tested, not the purpose of unit testing."
  - content: "What is the role of init scripts in configuration management in Azure Databricks?"
    choices:
    - content: "Init scripts are used to manage user access and permissions in Azure Databricks."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Init scripts do not manage user access or permissions. They are used for installing necessary libraries, configuring system settings, or setting environment variables."
    - content: "Init scripts are used to integrate Azure Databricks with version control systems like Git."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Init scripts do not handle integration with version control systems. They are used for installing necessary libraries, configuring system settings, or setting environment variables."
    - content: "Init scripts are used for installing necessary libraries, configuring system settings, or setting environment variables."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Init scripts run on each node of the cluster before the Spark driver or worker starts, ensuring consistent cluster configurations and reducing runtime errors due to misconfigurations."
