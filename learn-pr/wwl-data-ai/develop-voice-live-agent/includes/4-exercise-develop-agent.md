In this exercise, you complete a Flask-based Python web app based that enables real-time voice interactions with an agent. You add the code to initialize the session, and handle session events. You use a deployment script that: deploys the AI model; creates an image of the app in Azure Container Registry (ACR) using ACR tasks; and then creates an Azure App Service instance that pulls the image. To test the app, you need an audio device with microphone and speaker capabilities.

While this exercise is based on Python, you can develop similar applications other language-specific SDKs; including:

- [Azure VoiceLive client library for .NET](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Azure.AI.VoiceLive/)

Tasks performed in this exercise:

- Download the base files for the app
- Add code to complete the web app
- Review the overall code base
- Update and run the deployment script
- View and test the application

This exercise takes approximately **30** minutes to complete.
