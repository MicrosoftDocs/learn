  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "Which of these statements accurately defines AI information extraction?"
    choices:
    - content: "Using SQL code to query a database."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. SQL is used for querying databases, not for AI information extraction."
    - content: "Copying files from cloud storage to local disks."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. File transfer isn't AI information extraction."
    - content: "Analyzing unstructured content to identify and extract relevant fields and values."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. AI information extraction involves analyzing unstructured content to identify and extract relevant fields and values."
  - content: "How is OCR used in the information extraction process?"
    choices:
    - content: "Online Content Retrieval (OCR) is used to copy cloud data to a local device for processing."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. OCR stands for Optical Character Recognition, not Online Content Retrieval."
    - content: "Optical character recognition (OCR) is used to convert images of text into machine-readable text data."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. OCR converts images of text into machine-readable text data, enabling further processing."
    - content: "Open Conversion Routine (OCR) is a method for converting JSON data into images."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. OCR stands for Optical Character Recognition, not Open Conversion Routine."
  - content: "How does generative AI enhance the data extraction process?"
    choices:
    - content: "By using semantic language models to accurately match extracted values to data fields."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Generative AI uses semantic language models to understand context and accurately match extracted values to data fields."
    - content: "By manually coding extraction rules for each document type."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Generative AI reduces the need for manual coding by using semantic language models."
    - content: "By generating new documents from scratch."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. In the context of information extraction, generative AI is used to improve field matching, not new document creation."
