Today's organizations deal with all kinds of content such as documents, video, audio, images, and text. A common task in these organizations includes identifying and storing key information from the content into databases.

Consider some of these use cases: 
- A manufacturer has images of each of its products. The images need to be analyzed for defects and anomalies.  
- A business works with a high volume of invoices, contracts, and reports with charts. Key data and summaries from the documents need to be extracted and logged. 
- Many hours of customer calls are recorded for quality purposes. The audio needs to be transcribed, summarized, and analyzed for sentiment.  
- A streaming catalog contains a large volume of video. Important moments in each video need to be tagged with metadata based on their content.

Manually processing such content can be slow and potentially error-prone. **AI-powered information extraction** encompasses capabilities that extract meaning from content. In this module, you explore core concepts related to information extraction.
