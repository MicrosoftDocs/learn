In this module you learned how modern organizations can process content using AI-powered information extraction. Extracting key information from this content and storing it in structured formats (like databases) is essential but often time-consuming and error-prone. AI-powered information extraction uses machine learning to automate the identification and structuring of data. Generative AI further allows users to define custom fields (like “summary”) and generate values from unstructured content such as emails or videos. All of this extracted data can be used to improve the searchable content in a search index.
