    choices:
    - content: "Endpoint and Name"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "False. The endpoint is not unique and name is used to specify how to title the video."
    - content: "Account ID and API Key"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "True. The Account ID and API Key combination is unique to a Video Indexer subscription."
    - content: "Location and Partition"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "False. The location is either ‘trial’ or an Azure region so it is not unique to a subscription."

    choices:
    - content: "Shots"

      explanation: "True. Each scene is split into one or more shots."
    - content: "Tags"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "False. Tags are one of the insights extracted; not one of the levels in which videos are segmented."
    - content: "Sentiments"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "False. Sentiments are one of the insights extracted; not one of the levels in which videos are segmented."
  - content: "What results will be returned from a search request? (Choose one.):"
    choices:
    - content: "The search will return links to the start of videos only."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "False. The search results may start at timestamp 00:00 if match is for the whole video; but that is not all that is included."
    - content: "The search will return one item per video based on title and description."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "False. The search includes title and description; but searches on additional information and may include more than one match per video."
    - content: "The search will return exact moments in the video based on insights."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "True. The search results will include exact start times where an insight exists, possibly multiple matches for the same video if multiple segments are matched."
