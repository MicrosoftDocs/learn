quiz:
  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "Which intelligent query processing feature allows for faster calculations of a large number of rows?"
    choices:
    - content: "Batch mode on row store"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Batch mode is most effective in aggregation queries."
    - content: "Approximate count distinct"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Approximate count distinct only does counts, and not other calculations."
    - content: "Interleaved execution"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Interleaved execution leads to better row estimates, but does not itself speed calculations."
  - content: "Which component of resource governor allows you to configure limits on system resources?"
    choices:
    - content: "Workload groups"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Workload groups or just an organization role, and do not get assigned resources."
    - content: "Classifier functions"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Classifier functions assign connections to workload groups."
    - content: "Resource pools"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Resource pools are where resources are assigned in resource governor."
  - content: "Which database setting affects the way the query optimizer generates execution plans?"
    choices:
    - content: "Recovery model"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The recovery model only effects the ability to restore a database to a point in time, and not query plans."
    - content: "Optimize for ad hoc workloads"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This option affects the way execution plans are cached, but not the plan itself."
    - content: "Compatibility level"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. This setting affects the way the plan is created based on a number of engine factors."
