  questions:
  - content: "You have trained a model using a dataset containing data that was collected last year. As this year progresses, you will collect new data. You want to track any changing data trends that might affect the performance of the model. What should you do?"
    choices:
    - content: "Collect the new data in a new version of the existing training dataset, and profile both datasets."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That is incorrect. To track changing data trends, create a data drift monitor that uses the training data as a baseline and the new data as a target."
    - content: "Collect the new data in a separate dataset and create a Data Drift Monitor with the training dataset as a baseline and the new dataset as a target."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That is correct. To track changing data trends, create a data drift monitor that uses the training data as a baseline and the new data as a target."
    - content: "Replace the training dataset with a new dataset that contains both the original training data and the new data."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That is incorrect. To track changing data trends, create a data drift monitor that uses the training data as a baseline and the new data as a target."
  - content: "You are creating a data drift monitor. You want to automatically notify the data science team if a significant change in data distribution is detected. What must you do?"
    choices:
    - content: "Define an AlertConfiguration and set a drift_threshold value."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That is correct. To notify operators about data drift, create an AlertConfiguration with the email address to be notified, and a drift threshold that defines the level of change that triggers a notification."
    - content: "Set the latency of the data drift monitor to allow time for data scientists to review the new data."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That is incorrect. To notify operators about data drift, create an AlertConfiguration with the email address to be notified, and a drift threshold that defines the level of change that triggers a notification."
    - content: "Register the training dataset with the model, including the email address of the data science team as a tag."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That is incorrect. To notify operators about data drift, create an AlertConfiguration with the email address to be notified, and a drift threshold that defines the level of change that triggers a notification."
