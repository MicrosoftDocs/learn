As AI agents become more capable, the range of tools and services they can access also grows. However, registering new tools, managing, updating, and integrating them can quickly become complex and time-consuming. Dynamic tool discovery helps solve this problem by enabling agents to find and use tools automatically at runtime.

## What is dynamic tool discovery?

Dynamic tool discovery is a mechanism that allows an AI agent to discover available external tools without needing hardcoded knowledge of each one. Instead of manually adding or updating every tool your agent can use, the agent queries a centralized Model Context Protocol (MCP) server. This server acts as a live catalog, exposing tools that the agent can understand and call.

This approach means:

- Tools can be added, updated, or removed centrally without modifying the agent code.
- Agents can always use the latest version of a tool, improving accuracy and reliability.
- The complexity of managing tools shifts away from the agent and into a dedicated service.

## How does MCP enable dynamic tool discovery?

An MCP server hosts a set of functions that are exposed as tools using the `@mcp.tool` decorator. Tools are a primitive type in the MCP that enables servers to expose executable functionality to clients. A client can connect to the server and fetch these tools dynamically. The client then generates function wrappers that are added to the Azure AI Agent's tool definitions. This setup creates a flexible pipeline:

- The MCP server hosts available tools.
- The MCP client dynamically discovers the tools.
- The Azure AI Agent uses the available tools to respond to user requests.

## Why use dynamic tool discovery with MCP?

This approach provides several benefits:

- Scalability: Easily add new tools or update existing ones without redeploying agents.
- Modularity: Agents can remain simple, focusing on delegation rather than managing tool details.
- Maintainability: Centralized tool management reduces duplication and errors.
- Flexibility: Supports diverse tool types and complex workflows by aggregating capabilities.

Dynamic tool discovery is especially useful in environments where tools evolve rapidly or where many teams manage different APIs and services. Using tools allows AI agents to adapt to changing capabilities in real time, interact with external systems securely, and perform actions that go beyond language generation.
