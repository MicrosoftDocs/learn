  questions:
  - content: "What role does the MCP server play in the MCP agent tool integration?"
    choices:
    - content: "Runs the AI agent and processes user prompts directly."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The server hosts tools; the agent processes prompts."
    - content: "Manages network connections between multiple agents."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The server focuses on tool hosting, not agent networking."
    - content: "Hosts tool definitions and makes them available for discovery by the client."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The MCP server acts as a central registry for tool definitions."
  - content: "How does an MCP client retrieve available tools from the MCP server?"
    choices:
    - content: "By calling `session.list_tools()` to get the current tool catalog."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The client uses `list_tools()` to discover tools dynamically."
    - content: "By reading a static JSON file from the server directory."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Tools are discovered dynamically, not via static files."
    - content: "By subscribing to server events via a WebSocket connection."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The client uses direct calls, not event subscriptions, to list tools."
  - content: "Why should MCP tools be wrapped in async functions on the client-side?"
  choices:
    - content: "To allow the agent to wait for user input."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The tools do not prevent the agent from receiving user input."
     - content: "To enable asynchronous invocation so the agent can call tools without blocking."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Async functions let the agent invoke tools efficiently."
    - content: "To convert the functions into REST API endpoints automatically."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Wrapping tools in async functions does not generate REST endpoints."
