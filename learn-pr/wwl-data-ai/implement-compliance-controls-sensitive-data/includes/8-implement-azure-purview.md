Microsoft Purview is a unified data governance service that helps you manage and govern your on-premises, multicloud, and software-as-a-service (SaaS) data. Create a holistic, up-to-date map of your data landscape with automated data discovery, sensitive data classification, and end-to-end data lineage. Enable data curators to manage and secure your data estate. Empower data consumers to find valuable, trustworthy data.

## How it works

Microsoft Purview automates data discovery by providing data scanning and classification as a service for assets across your data estate. Metadata and descriptions of discovered data assets are integrated into a holistic map of your data estate. Atop this map, there are purpose-built apps that create environments for data discovery, access management, and insights about your data landscape.

## Requirements

Before you get started with Microsoft Purview, ensure the following requirements are met:

- Access to Microsoft Azure with a development or production subscription.
- Ability to create Azure resources including Microsoft Purview.
- Access to data sources such as Azure Data Lake Storage or Azure SQL in test, development, or production environments.
    - For Data Lake Storage, the required role to scan is **Reader**.
    - For Azure SQL, the identity must be able to query tables for sampling of classifications.
- Access to Microsoft Defender for Cloud or ability to collaborate with Defender for Cloud Admin for data labeling.
- An active Microsoft Purview account.
- You need to be a **Data Source Administrator** and **Data Reader** to register a source and manage it in the Microsoft Purview governance portal.

## Security considerations

Let's review some important security capabilities when scanning a SQL Database using Microsoft Purview.

### Firewall settings

If your database server has a firewall enabled, you need to update the firewall to allow access in one of two ways:

- **Allow Azure connections through the firewall –** A straightforward option to route traffic through Azure networking, without needing to manage virtual machines.

- **Install a self-hosted integration runtime –** Install a self-hosted integration runtime on a machine in your network and give it access through the firewall. If you have a private virtual network set up within Azure, or have any other closed network set up, using a self-hosted integration runtime on a machine within that network will allow you to fully manage traffic flow and utilize your existing network.

- **Use a managed virtual network –** You can use the Azure integration runtime in a closed network by setting up a managed virtual network using your Microsoft Purview account to connect to Azure SQL.

### Authentication

To scan your data source, you need to configure an authentication method in the Azure SQL Database. The following authentication options are supported when preparing for a scan:

- **System-assigned managed identity (recommended) –** This is an identity associated directly with your Microsoft Purview account that allows you to authenticate directly with other Azure resources without needing to manage a go-between user or credential set. The system-assigned managed identity is created when your Microsoft Purview resource is created, is managed by Azure, and uses your Microsoft Purview account's name. The system-assigned managed identity can't currently be used with a self-hosted integration runtime for Azure SQL.

- **User-assigned managed identity (preview) –** Similar to system-assigned managed identity, a user-assigned managed identity is a credential resource that allows Microsoft Purview to authenticate against Microsoft Entra ID. The user-assigned managed by users in Azure, rather than by Azure itself, which gives you more control over security. The user-assigned managed identity can't currently be used with a self-hosted integration runtime for Azure SQL. For more information, see our guide for user-assigned managed identities.

- **Service Principal –** A service principal is an application that can be assigned permissions like any other group or user, without being associated directly with a person. Their authentication has an expiration date, and so can be useful for temporary projects.

- **SQL Authentication –** Connect to the SQL database with a username and password.

>[!NOTE]
>If you're using a self-hosted integration runtime to connect to your resource, system-assigned and user-assigned managed identities won't work. You need to use service principal authentication or SQL authentication.

## Data lineage

Generally, data lineage represents the journey the data takes from its origin to where it moves across the data estate over time. Among its many uses are troubleshooting, tracing the root cause in data pipelines, and debugging.

Microsoft Purview Data Catalog connects with other data storage, processing, and analytics platforms to collect lineage information. As a result, the Catalog contains a generic, scenario-specific lineage experience.

Microsoft Purview supports data lineage from Azure SQL Database. At the time of setting up a scan, you can enable lineage extraction toggle button to extract lineage information.

### Prerequisites for setting up scan with Lineage extraction

1. Follow steps under authentication for a scan using Managed Identity section to authorize Microsoft Purview scan your Azure SQL Database.

1. Sign in to Azure SQL Database with Microsoft Entra account and assign proper permission (for example: **db_owner**) to Purview Managed identity. Use below example SQL syntax to create user and grant permission by replacing *purview-account* with your account name.

    ```sql
    CREATE user <purview-account> FROM EXTERNAL PROVIDER
    GO
    EXEC sp_addrolemember 'db_owner', <purview-account> 
    GO
    ```

1. Run below command on your Azure SQL Database to create a master key.

    ```sql
    CREATE MASTER KEY
    GO
    ```

### Create scan with lineage extraction toggle turned on

1. Enable lineage extraction toggle in the scan screen.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > [![Screenshot that shows the screen to create a new scan with lineage extraction.](../media/dp-3300-module-33-lab-69.png)](../media/dp-3300-module-33-lab-69.png#lightbox)

1. Select your method of authentication by following steps in the scan section.

1. Once the scan is successfully set up from previous step, a new scan type called Lineage extraction runs incremental scans every 6 hours to extract lineage from Azure SQL Database. Lineage is extracted based on the actual stored procedure runs in the Azure SQL Database.

### Search Azure SQL Database assets and view runtime lineage

You can browse the data catalog or search the data catalog to view asset details for Azure SQL Database following the steps below:

1.	Go to asset -> lineage tab, you can see the asset lineage when applicable. Refer to the supported capabilities section on the supported Azure SQL Database lineage scenarios. For more information about lineage in general, see data lineage and lineage user guide

2.	Go to stored procedure asset -> Properties -> Related assets to see the latest run details of stored procedures

    :::image type="content" source="../media/dp-3300-module-33-lab-72.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the screen with stored procedure properties containing runs.":::

3.	Select the stored procedure hyperlink next to Runs to see Azure SQL Stored Procedure Run Overview. Go to properties tab to see enhanced run time information from stored procedure. For example: executedTime, rowcount, Client Connection, and so on
