    choices:
    - content: "In the extended properties for each object"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This was the case in older versions of SQL Server, but not in SQL Server 2019."

      explanation: "That's correct. This is the correct view."
    - content: "In the sys.all_columns catalog view"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This view does contain classification."
  - content: "Which server-level action group audits queries and stored procedures executed against an Azure SQL Database?"
    choices:
    - content: "BATCH_STARTED_GROUP"
      isCorrect: false

    - content: "BATCH_COMPLETED_GROUP"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. BATCH_COMPLETED_GROUP is raised whenever any batch text, stored procedure, or transaction management operation completes executing."
    - content: "SENSITIVE_BATCH_COMPLETED_GROUP"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. SENSITIVE_BATCH_COMPLETED_GROUP is raised whenever any batch text, stored procedure, or transaction management operation completes executing on sensitive data classified labels."
  - content: "Which block predicate prevents users from updating rows to values that violate its row-level security predicate?"
    choices:
    - content: "AFTER INSERT"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. AFTER INSERT prevents users from inserting rows with values that violate the predicate."
    - content: "BEFORE UPDATE"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. BEFORE UPDATE prevents users from updating rows that currently violate the predicate."
    - content: "AFTER UPDATE"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. AFTER UPDATE prevents users from updating rows to values that violate the predicate."
  - content: "Which of the following features can be used to automate data discovery through the provision of data scanning and classification as a service?"
    choices:
    - content: "Database auditing"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Database auditing tracks database events and writes them to an audit log in your Azure Storage account, Log Analytics workspace or Event Hubs."
    - content: "Dynamic data masking"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Dynamic data masking works by obfuscating data in order to limit its exposure."
    - content: "Azure Purview"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Azure Purview automates data discovery by providing data scanning and classification as a service for assets across your data estate."
