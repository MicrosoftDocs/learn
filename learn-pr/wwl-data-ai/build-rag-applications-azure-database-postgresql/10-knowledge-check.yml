  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: What does GraphRAG add to a standard RAG pipeline?
    choices:
    - content: A replacement for vector search that removes embeddings
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. GraphRAG complements vectors; it doesn't remove them.
    - content: A knowledge graph so retrieval can follow relationships before ranking with embeddings
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. Graph structure guides what to retrieve.
    - content: A new fine-tuned model trained on policies
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. GraphRAG changes retrieval, not model training.
  - content: When results are combined from vector and keyword searches, what simple method helps merge rankings?
    choices:
    - content: L2 normalization of all vectors
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. That's a vector scaling step, not a rank merger.
    - content: Cross join of both result sets
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. A cross join doesn't merge rankings meaningfully.
    - content: Reciprocal Rank Fusion
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. It blends lists without heavy tuning.
  - content: What SQL statement is useful to check timing and confirm a vector index is used?
    choices:
    - content: DESCRIBE TABLE on the target relation
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. That only shows schema details.
    - content: EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS) followed by the query
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. It shows the plan and actual work done.
    - content: VACUUM ANALYZE on the database
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. It updates stats but doesn't display a plan.
