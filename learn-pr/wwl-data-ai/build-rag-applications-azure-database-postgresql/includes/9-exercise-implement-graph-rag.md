GraphRAG combines text similarity with graph-based connections to improve retrieval accuracy in RAG applications. In this exercise, you implement a GraphRAG pipeline using *Azure Database for PostgreSQL* with the *Apache AGE* extension and *pgvector* for vector similarity search. You extract a lightweight knowledge graph from your data and use it to enhance retrieval for complex queries.
