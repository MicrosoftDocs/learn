Azure Synapse serverless SQL pool can be used for data transformations. In this module, you learned how to write CETAS (CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE AS SELECT) statements to perform the transformation and materialize the results to a data lake in a desired file format. Further, you created stored procedure to encapsulate the transformation logic and Synapse Pipeline that will operationalize the transformation.

In this module, you have learned how to:

- Transform data with Azure Synapse serverless SQL pools using CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE AS SELECT statement
- Operationalize data transformation with Azure Synapse serverless SQL pools using stored procedures
- Use Azure Synapse serverless SQL pool stored procedures from Synapse Pipelines
