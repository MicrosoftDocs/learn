title: Design a data partitioning strategy
summary: Identify strategies for managing relationships between data entities, such as customers and sales data. Improve data-model performance and scaling by pre-aggregating and denormalizing your data. Use change-feed to maintain your data's referential integrity.
abstract: |
  At the completing this module we will learn:
  *   Manage relationships between data entities by using advanced modeling and partitioning strategies.
  *   Maintain the referential integrity of your data by using change feed.
  *   Implement pre-aggregating and denormalizing data strategies to improve data-model performance and scaling.
  *   Optimizing storage and compute by mixing entity types in a single container
prerequisites: |
  - Familiarity with Azure Cosmos DB concepts such as databases, containers, documents, and throughput (request units per second [RU/s]).
  - Familiarity with navigating Azure Cosmos DB resources and data by using Data Explorer in the Azure portal, running queries, and viewing query stats in results.
  - Familiarity with basic modeling and partitioning strategies, such as embedding or referencing data in entities.
  - Familiarity with Azure Cosmos DB .NET SDK v3.
  - Familiarity with Azure Cosmos DB change feed.
