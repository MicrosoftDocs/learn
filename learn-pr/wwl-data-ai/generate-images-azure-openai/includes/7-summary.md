This module described the DALL-E image generation model, and how you can use it in the Azure OpenAI service to generate images based on natural language prompts. You can explore DALL-E using the playground in Azure OpenAI Studio, and you can use the REST API to build applications that use DALL-E to generate new images.

> [!TIP]
> To learn more about using DALL-E in the Azure OpenAI service, see [Quickstart: Get started generating images using Azure OpenAI Service](/azure/cognitive-services/openai/dall-e-quickstart) in the Azure openAI service documentation.
