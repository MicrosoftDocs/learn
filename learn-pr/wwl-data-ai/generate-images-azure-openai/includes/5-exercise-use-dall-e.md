Now it's your chance to use generative AI to create images. In this exercise, you'll provision an Azure AI Foundry project and deploy a DALL-E model. Then, you'll explore image generation in the Azure AI Foundry portal. Finally, you'll use the Python or .NET SDK to consume the DALL-E model from a custom application.
