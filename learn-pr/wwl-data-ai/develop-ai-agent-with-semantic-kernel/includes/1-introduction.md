AI agents are transforming how applications interact with users and automate tasks. Unlike traditional programs, AI agents use generative AI to interpret data, make decisions, and complete tasks with minimal human intervention. These agents use large language models to streamline complex workflows, making them ideal for automating business processes. 

Developers can build AI agents using different tools, including the Semantic Kernel SDK. This open-source SDK simplifies the integration of AI models into applications. The Semantic Kernel Agent Framework supports different types of agents, including `ChatCompletionAgent`, `OpenAIAssistantAgent`, and `AzureAIAgent`. This module focuses on the `AzureAIAgent`, a type of agent that streamlines the features and functionalities of Azure AI Agent Service. 

Azure AI Agent Service is a fully managed service that enables developers to securely build, deploy, and scale high-quality extensible AI agents. Using the Azure AI Agent Service, developers don't need to manage the underlying compute or storage resources. Using the Semantic Kernel Agent Framework allows developers to quickly build agents on the Azure AI Agent Service, with support for natural language processing and access to built-in tools in just a few lines of code.

While Azure AI Agent Service provides a powerful foundation for building AI agents, Semantic Kernel offers additional flexibility and scalability. If you've already started developing agents with Semantic Kernel, you can seamlessly integrate Azure AI Agent capabilities, such as built-in tools and project deployment, without rewriting your code. Also, if your solution requires multiple types of agents, using Semantic Kernel ensures consistency across your implementation. Finally, if you're planning to develop multi-agent solutions, Semantic Kernel's GroupChat feature allows you to orchestrate collaborative agents efficientlyâ€”a topic covered in more detail in a later module.

Suppose you need to develop an AI agent that automatically formats and emails expense reports for employees. Your AI agent can extract data from submitted expense reports, format them correctly, and send them to the appropriate recipients. To do this, you can use the Semantic Kernel Agent Framework. The plugins and functions feature allows your AI agent to interact with APIs, retrieve necessary data, and complete tasks.

In this module, you learn about the core features of the Semantic Kernel SDK and the Agent Framework. You also learn how to create your own AI agents and extend their capabilities with plugin functions.

After completing this module, you're now able to:

- Use Semantic Kernel to connect to an Azure AI Foundry project.
- Create Azure AI Agent Service agents using the Semantic Kernel SDK.
- Integrate plugin functions with your AI agent.
