  questions:
  - content: "What is the main purpose of the AzureAIAgent class in Semantic Kernel?"
    choices:  
      - content: "To provide a low-level interface for directly managing AI models"  
        isCorrect: false  
        explanation: "Incorrect. The AzureAIAgent class is built on top of Azure AI Agent Service and streamlines its features rather than providing a low-level interface."  
      - content: "To simplify the use of Azure AI Agent Service by abstracting complex operations"  
        isCorrect: true  
        explanation: "Correct. The AzureAIAgent class is designed to streamline the usage of Azure AI Agent Service, reducing the complexity of setting up and managing AI agents."  
      - content: "To replace the need for prompt templates in AI workflows"  
        isCorrect: false  
        explanation: "Incorrect. AzureAIAgent enhances agent interactions but doesn't replace prompt templates, which are useful for defining structured AI behavior."  
  - content: "Which component in the Agent Framework manages conversation state and stores messages?"  
    choices:  
      - content: "Agent threads"  
        isCorrect: true  
        explanation: "Correct. Agent threads store conversations and maintain conversation state across multiple interactions."  
      - content: "Agent chat"  
        isCorrect: false  
        explanation: "Incorrect. Agent chat provides the structure for multi-agent interactions but doesn't store messages."  
      - content: "AI service connectors"  
        isCorrect: false  
        explanation: "Incorrect. AI service connectors allow AI models to interact with external services but don't handle conversation state."  
  - content: "Which step is necessary to enable an AzureAIAgent to use a plugin?"  
    choices:  
      - content: "Modify the AI model's architecture to integrate the plugin"  
        isCorrect: false  
        explanation: "Incorrect. Plugins work through function calling and don't require modifications to the AI model itself."  
      - content: "Configure the plugin in Azure Portal before using it in Semantic Kernel"  
        isCorrect: false  
        explanation: "Incorrect. Plugins are defined and added programmatically in the codebase, not configured in the Azure Portal."  
      - content: "Define a class with methods annotated using the `kernel_function` decorator"  
        isCorrect: true  
        explanation: "Correct. The first step in using a plugin is defining a class and annotating its methods with the `kernel_function` decorator so the AI knows how to use them."
