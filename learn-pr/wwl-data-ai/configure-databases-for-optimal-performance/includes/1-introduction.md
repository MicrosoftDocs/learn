In recent versions of SQL Server, Microsoft has moved more configuration options to the database level, giving you more granularity in how your databases behave. Along with those options, they have introduced intelligent query processing features that allow the query optimizer to make better choices.

Even when your database is in the cloud, ongoing performance-related maintenance tasks are critical to the overall success of your applications. Whether it's a SQL Server instance in an Azure Virtual Machine or Azure SQL Database, you need to ensure your statistics are current, and your indexes are well organized.
