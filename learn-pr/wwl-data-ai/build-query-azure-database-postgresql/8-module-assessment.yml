  questions:
  - content: "This is a question"
    choices:
    - content: "TEXT"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "TEXT stores plain character data and doesn't support structured data operations like indexing nested fields or querying by key."
    - content: "JSONB"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "JSONB stores JSON data in a binary format that supports indexing and efficient querying. It's ideal when data structure varies between records and you need to query or filter based on nested values."
    - content: "VARCHAR(MAX)"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "PostgreSQL doesn't have a VARCHAR(MAX) type. VARCHAR requires a specific length limit and stores plain character data without structured data support."
