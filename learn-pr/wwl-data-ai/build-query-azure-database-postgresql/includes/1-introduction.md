AI applications and data-driven services require reliable, scalable database solutions to store and retrieve information efficiently. This module guides you through building applications with Azure Database for PostgreSQL to enable persistent data storage, complex querying, and seamless application integration for your AI solutions.

Imagine you're a developer building an AI agent that assists users with research tasks. Your agent needs to maintain conversation history across sessions, track multi-step task progress, and store structured data that informs its decision-making. The client expects the system to handle thousands of concurrent users, maintain sub-second query response times for context retrieval, and support complex queries across conversation histories.

You chose PostgreSQL for its rich feature set, including JSON support for flexible schemas, robust transactional guarantees, and an extensive extension ecosystem. However, managing database infrastructure, ensuring high availability, handling backups, and scaling to meet demand requires significant operational overhead. The client also requires enterprise-grade security with Microsoft Entra integration for identity management.

Azure Database for PostgreSQL provides a fully managed PostgreSQL experience that eliminates infrastructure management while delivering the control and flexibility developers need. The service handles patching, backups, and high availability automatically, letting you focus on building your application logic rather than maintaining database infrastructure.

After completing this module, you'll be able to:

- Explain the architecture and key features of Azure Database for PostgreSQL
- Establish secure connections to PostgreSQL using Microsoft Entra authentication and TLS
- Create and manage database schemas including tables, indexes, and constraints
- Write efficient SQL queries for common data operations
- Integrate Azure Database for PostgreSQL into applications using Python
