quiz:
  questions:
  - content: "What is the role of the main agent in a connected agent system?"
    choices:
    - content: "To directly perform all tasks using tools"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The main agent delegates tasks rather than performing them directly."
    - content: "To coordinate user input and route tasks to the appropriate connected agents"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The main agent handles intent recognition and delegates work to connected agents."
    - content: "To monitor agent performance and generate logs"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Logging isn't the role of the main agent."
  - content: "How do you connect an agent to a main agent using the Azure AI Projects client library?"
    choices:
    - content: "Add the agent as a `ConnectedAgentTool` to the main agent's tool definition."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. You register the agent as a tool and include it when configuring the main agent."
    - content: "Use the `link_agents()` method to bind the sub-agent to the main agent."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. There isn't such a method; connected agents are registered as tools."
    - content: "Set the main agent's parent_id to the sub-agent's agent ID."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Agent relationships aren't configured through ID inheritance."
  - content: "How does the main agent decide which connected agent to use?"
    choices:
    - content: "It uses prompt instructions and natural language understanding."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The main agent uses natural language prompts to determine task routing."
    - content: "It follows a fixed code-based decision tree."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. No hardcoded routing logic is needed."
    - content: "It randomly selects from available connected agents."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Task routing is based on the user's intent and the prompt design."
