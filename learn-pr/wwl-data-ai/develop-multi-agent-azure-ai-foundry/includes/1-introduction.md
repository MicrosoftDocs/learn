Azure AI Foundry Agent Service can help you develop sophisticated, multi-agent systems that can break down complex tasks into smaller, specialized roles. Using connected agents, you can design intelligent solutions where a primary agent delegates work to sub-agents without the need for custom orchestration logic or hardcoded routing. This modular approach boosts efficiency and maintainability across a wide range of scenarios.

Imagine you're on an engineering team that receives a constant flow of support tickets including bugs, feature requests, and infrastructure issues. Manually reviewing and sorting each one takes time and slows down your teamâ€™s ability to respond quickly. With a multi-agent approach, you can build a triage assistant that assigns different tasks to specialized agents. The sub-agents might perform tasks such as classifying ticket type, setting priority, and suggesting the right team for the work. With a multi-agent approach, these specialized agents can work together to streamline the ticketing process.

In this module, you'll learn how to use connected agents in Azure AI Foundry. You'll also practice building an intelligent ticket triage system using a collaborative mutli-agent solution.
