In this exercise, you'll update a predeveloped data model to enforce security. Specifically, salespeople at the Adventure Works company should only be able to see sales data related to their assigned sales region. You learn how to:

- Create static roles
- Create dynamic roles
- Validate roles
- Map security principals to semantic model roles

When you finish the exercise, end the lab to close the VM. Don't forget to come back and complete the knowledge check to earn points for completing this module!
