Computer vision is a core area of artificial intelligence (AI), focused on understanding the information contained within visual data sources, such as images and videos. This branch of AI aims to emulate human visual perception by using advanced algorithms to recognize the content and context of optical inputs.

**Azure Computer Vision** equips developers with a unified service for accessing multiple state-of-the-art computer vision capabilities. Updated to take advantage of significant improvements offered by Microsoft's Florence foundation model, Vision Services greatly enhances image analysis functionality and provides groundbreaking customization capabilities.

Using the updated Image Analysis 4.0 service, developers can use the Azure Computer Vision APIs to quickly and easily integrate powerful image analysis functionality into applications. These features including creating image captions and human-readable descriptions, extracting and reading text, detecting faces, and searching visual inputs using natural language queries.

Vision Studio provides developers with a low-code, UI-based tool for trying out the capabilities of Image Analysis 4.0. Application developers using Vision Studio can create and train custom image classification and object detection models, incorporating powerful vision capabilities into applications without needing machine learning experience.

In this module you'll explore the improved computer vision capabilities of Microsoft's Florence foundation model, and use Image Analysis to analyze images and create a custom object detection model.
