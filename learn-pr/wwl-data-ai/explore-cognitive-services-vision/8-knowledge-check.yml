  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "Which Image Analysis 4.0 feature generates an English sentence describing image contents, plus descriptions for other objects and regions within the image?"
    choices:
    - content: "Caption"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Caption generates a single, human-readable English sentence describing the image but doesn't create tags for individual objects and regions within the image."
    - content: "Dense Captions"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Dense Captions generates a single, human-readable English sentence describing the image and also creates tags for individual objects and regions within the image."
    - content: "Tags"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The Tags feature creates a list of labels or tags for the image and other features detected within it."
  - content: "Object detection models are used to do what?"
    choices:
    - content: "Classify images based on their primary subject matter."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Image classification models are used to classify or categorize pictures based on their primary subject matter."
    - content: "Identify and categorize individual entities and their location within an image."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Object detection models in computer vision identify and categorize individual entities or objects within an image."
    - content: "Create a list of labels for an image."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Tagging models create a list of labels or tags for an image and other features identified within it."
  - content: "When using Vision Studio, what is the easiest way to generate a COCO annotation for a custom object detection model in Image Analysis 4.0?"
    choices:
    - content: "Use the Azure Machine Learning data-labeling workflow."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. In Image Analysis 4.0, the data-labeling workflow in Azure Machine Learning generates the COCO file for training data. Azure Machine Learning allows you to manually label your images and generate a COCO file that can be imported into Vision Studio."
    - content: "Use the Vision Studio COCO file generator utility after manually labeling images in the Dataset."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Vision Studio doesn't contain a COCO file generator utility."
    - content: "Import a COCO file created manually in Visual Studio Code."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. COCO files are JSON files that can be created manually using tools like Visual Studio Code. However, using Visual Studio Code to create a COCO file isn't the easiest way to generate the file."
