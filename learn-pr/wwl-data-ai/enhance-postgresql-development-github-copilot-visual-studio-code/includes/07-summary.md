This module focused on developing PostgreSQL solutions in Visual Studio Code by using the PostgreSQL extension together with GitHub Copilot. You explored how the PostgreSQL extension adds core database capabilities to the editor, including database connections, object exploration, query execution, and results review. You also saw how GitHub Copilot uses the context of a connected PostgreSQL database to assist with writing and refining SQL queries.

By working entirely within Visual Studio Code, database tasks such as exploring schemas, generating SQL queries, and validating results can be performed without switching tools. This integrated approach helps reduce friction when inspecting database structures, troubleshooting query behavior, or confirming data changes. GitHub Copilot provides a practical starting point for writing and adjusting SQL through natural-language prompts, while the PostgreSQL extension ensures queries reflect the actual structure of the database.

After completing this module, you can:

- Use the PostgreSQL extension for Visual Studio Code to connect to PostgreSQL databases, explore database objects, and execute SQL queries.
- Use GitHub Copilot Chat to generate SQL queries based on natural-language prompts and the connected database schema.
- Modify and refine Copilot-generated SQL queries to address specific query requirements.
- Execute SQL queries and review results in Visual Studio Code to validate behavior and troubleshoot issues.
