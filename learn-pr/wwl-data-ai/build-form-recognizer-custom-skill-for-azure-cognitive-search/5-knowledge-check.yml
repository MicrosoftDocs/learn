    choices:
    - content: "formUrl."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The formUrl value is the link to a document to analyze."
    - content: "recordId."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The recordId value in the output is matched to the recordId of a form in the input."
    - content: "formSasToken."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The formSasToken value is used to authenticate with an Azure Storage account when the form is stored there."
  - content: "You're troubleshooting your Cognitive Search indexing process. You have a single custom skill that calls Form Recognizer but requests are never received by your skill. Which of the following stages of the indexing process might be causing the problem?"
    choices:
    - content: "Push to index."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The push to index stage happens after the skillset is complete."
    - content: "Output field mapping."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The output field mapping stage happens after the skillset is complete."
    - content: "Document cracking."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Since the document cracking stage happens before the skillset execution, it might prevent requests from reaching your custom skill."
