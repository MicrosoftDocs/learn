    choices:
    - content: "Push to index."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The push to index stage happens after the skillset is complete."

      explanation: "Incorrect. The output field mapping stage happens after the skillset is complete."
    - content: "Document cracking."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Since the document cracking stage happens before the skillset execution, it might prevent requests from reaching your custom skill."
