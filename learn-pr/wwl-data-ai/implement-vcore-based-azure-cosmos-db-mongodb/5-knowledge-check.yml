quiz:
  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "What feature of vCore-based Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB simplifies the building of AI-driven applications?"
    choices:
    - content: "Flexible shard key implementation"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While shard keys are important for scaling, they do not simplify the building of AI-driven applications."
    - content: "Integrated Vector Search feature"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The Vector Search feature simplifies data indexing and querying using data embeddings for AI within the database."
    - content: "Integrated Azure Monitor"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Azure Monitor aids in performance monitoring and troubleshooting, not directly in building AI-driven applications."
  - content: "Which method can you use to create a vCore-based Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB cluster?"
    choices:
    - content: "Direct database insertion without a cluster"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Direct database insertion is not a method for creating a cluster."
    - content: "Using the Azure portal"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The Azure portal provides straightforward prompts to create your cluster."
    - content: "Manual configuration of each database node of the cluster"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Manual node configuration is not required for creating a vCore-based cluster."
  - content: "Why is native support for storing and searching vector embeddings important in vCore-based Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB?"
    choices:
    - content: "It enables efficient AI features like similarity search"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Vector embeddings are crucial for AI applications, enabling features like similarity searches."
    - content: "It reduces the cost of storage significantly"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While cost-efficient, the main importance isn't cost reduction."
    - content: "To automate AI model training directly within the database"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While vector embeddings enhance AI capabilities, they do not automate AI model training within the database."
