  questions:
  - content: "An Azure Cosmos DB container's throughput was manually provisioned. Incoming requests exceeded the provisioned request units per second (RU/s). What happens next?"
    choices:
    - content: "Azure Cosmos DB rate-limits subsequent requests."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Manually provisioned throughput rate-limits requests, with a response indicating that a wait should be attempted before retrying."
    - content: "Azure Cosmos DB scales RU/s up to a service maximum of 50,000 RU/s."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The container's throughput was manually provisioned where RU/s don't change and remain static."
    - content: "Azure Cosmos DB scales RU/s up to a maximum RU/s that were previously configured."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The container's throughput was manually provisioned where RU/s always remain static and not scale up or down."
  - content: "The web development team is building a proof of concept. During this development, the team successfully estimated the throughput needs of the application within a 5% margin of error and doesn't expect any significant variances over time. When the app runs in production, the team expects the workload to be extraordinarily stable. What type of throughput option should be considered?"
    choices:
    - content: "Autoscale"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Autoscale throughput is better suited for unpredictable traffic."
    - content: "Serverless"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Serverless can better handle workloads that have wildly varying traffic and low average-to-peak traffic ratios."
    - content: "Standard"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Standard throughput is suited for workloads with steady traffic."
