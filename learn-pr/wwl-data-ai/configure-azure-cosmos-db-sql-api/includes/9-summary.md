In this module, we talked about the patterns and needs of different applications and how they mapped to the throughput offerings of Azure Cosmos DB. With serverless, autoscale, or standard provisioning, you have many different ways to service the needs of your applications.

Now that you have completed this module, you can:

- Compare serverless and provisioned throughput models
- Compare and migrate between autoscale and standard throughput containers
