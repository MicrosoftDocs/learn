Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of artificial intelligence focused on enabling machines to understand, interpret, and respond to human language. The goal of NLP is to analyze and extract meaning or structure from existing text.

Consider some of these applications of NLP: 

- *Customer Feedback Analysis*: Organizations need to analyze large volumes of customer reviews, support tickets, or survey responses. By applying sentiment analysis and key phrase extraction, businesses can identify trends, detect dissatisfaction early, and improve customer experiences. 

- *Healthcare Text Analysis*: In the healthcare sector, Azure's language solutions are used to extract clinical information from unstructured medical documents. Features like entity recognition and text analytics for health help identify symptoms, medications, and diagnoses, supporting faster and more accurate decision-making.

- *Conversational AI with Virtual Agents*: Azure's language solutions power virtual assistants that can interpret user intent, translate conversations, extract relevant entities, and respond appropriately. 

Next, let's explore language capabilities on Azure.
