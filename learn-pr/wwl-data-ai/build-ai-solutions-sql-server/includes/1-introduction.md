[SQL Server 2025](/sql/sql-server/what-s-new-in-sql-server-2025?azure-portal=true) introduces AI capabilities directly into the database engine. This release embeds features such as [native vector data types](/sql/t-sql/data-types/vector-data-type?azure-portal=true), [embedding generation](/sql/t-sql/functions/ai-generate-embeddings-transact-sql?azure-portal=true), and connectivity with [Azure OpenAI](/azure/ai-services/openai/overview?azure-portal=true) and other frameworks, enabling organizations to implement semantic search and build AI applications using [T-SQL](/sql/t-sql/language-reference?azure-portal=true).

SQL Server 2025 supports deployment both on-premises and in the cloud. Features include [Fabric mirroring](/fabric/database/mirrored-database/overview?azure-portal=true), [managed identities](/sql/sql-server/azure-arc/managed-identity?azure-portal=true), and encryption capabilities. Organizations can use these features to build generative AI applications while maintaining their existing SQL Server infrastructure.

> [!NOTE]
> You can download SQL Server 2025 from the [Microsoft Evaluation Center](https://www.microsoft.com/evalcenter/evaluate-sql-server-2025?azure-portal=true).

In this module, you'll learn how to apply SQL Server 2025's AI capabilities to build intelligent, data-driven applications. You'll explore native vector support, implement semantic search, integrate with Azure OpenAI and other AI services, and build [Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)](/azure/ai-services/openai/concepts/use-your-data?azure-portal=true) applications—all using familiar T-SQL and modern development frameworks.
