  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "Which function should you use to perform exact nearest neighbor (k-NN) search on vector embeddings in SQL Server 2025?"
    choices:
    - content: "`VECTOR_SEARCH`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. `VECTOR_SEARCH` is used for approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search using DiskANN indexes, not exact k-NN search."
    - content: "`VECTOR_DISTANCE`"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. `VECTOR_DISTANCE` calculates the distance between two vectors using a specified metric (cosine, euclidean, or dot product) and is used for exact k-NN search by comparing the query vector against all vectors in the dataset."
    - content: "`AI_GENERATE_EMBEDDINGS`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. `AI_GENERATE_EMBEDDINGS` is used to generate vector embeddings from text using external AI models, not for searching vectors."
  - content: "What is the primary purpose of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) in SQL Server 2025?"
    choices:
    - content: "To replace large language models with database queries"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. RAG doesn't replace language models; it augments them by providing relevant data from the database as context."
    - content: "To dynamically retrieve relevant information from the database and provide it as context to AI models"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. RAG applications dynamically retrieve relevant information from the database using vector search and provide it as context to language models, ensuring responses are grounded in current, accurate data."
    - content: "To store large language models directly in SQL Server tables"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. RAG doesn't store language models in SQL Server; it retrieves data from the database to provide context to external AI models."
  - content: "Which authentication method eliminates the need to store API keys when connecting SQL Server 2025 to Azure OpenAI?"
    choices:
    - content: "Database-scoped credentials with `HTTPEndpointHeaders`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Database-scoped credentials with `HTTPEndpointHeaders` still require storing API keys in the SECRET parameter."
    - content: "Managed identities with SQL Server enabled by Azure Arc"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Managed identities eliminate the need to store credentials by using Azure's identity infrastructure. With SQL Server enabled by Azure Arc, the Azure platform handles credential rotation and access management automatically."
    - content: "Windows Authentication"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Windows Authentication is used for SQL Server authentication, not for connecting to external AI services like Azure OpenAI."
  - content: "What is the recommended approach when implementing safety guardrails for AI-generated SQL queries in conversational interfaces?"
    choices:
    - content: "Allow all generated queries to execute without validation"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Allowing all queries without validation could result in destructive operations like deleting or modifying data."
    - content: "Validate generated SQL to ensure only read-only operations are permitted"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Safety guardrails should validate AI-generated SQL queries to prevent operations like DROP, DELETE, UPDATE, INSERT, ALTER, and CREATE, ensuring users can only query data, not modify it."
    - content: "Execute all queries in a separate database to prevent data loss"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While this might prevent data loss in the production database, it doesn't address the root issue of validating that AI-generated queries are safe and appropriate."
