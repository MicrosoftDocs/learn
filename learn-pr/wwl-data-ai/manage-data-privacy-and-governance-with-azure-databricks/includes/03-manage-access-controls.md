Managing access controls within Azure Databricks using the Unity Catalog is an effective way to handle data governance and security across your data and AI assets. Here’s a step-by-step guide to setting up and managing these controls.

## Understanding Unity Catalog
Unity Catalog is a unified governance solution for all data assets in Databricks, providing a central point to manage data access policies. It integrates seamlessly with Databricks workspaces to control access at the table, column, and row level.

## Setting Up Unity Catalog
Before you can manage access controls, you need to set up Unity Catalog in your Azure Databricks environment.

**Enable unity catalog**: First, ensure that Unity Catalog is enabled in your Databricks workspace.

**Create a metastore**: Set up a new metastore associated with your Unity Catalog. This metastore serves as the central repository for all data asset definitions and governance policies.

## Configuring Data Permissions
Unity Catalog allows you to define fine-grained access control policies.

**Manage data permissions**: Use SQL GRANT and REVOKE statements to assign or remove access to data assets. For example, 

```sql

GRANT SELECT ON TABLE sales_data TO ROLE analyst;

```
**Role-based access control (RBAC)**: Define roles and assign users to these roles. Roles can encapsulate specific permissions, making it easier to manage access for groups of users.

## Securing Sensitive Data
Unity Catalog provides column-level security to restrict access to specific columns, such as personal identification information, and dynamic data masking to automatically obscure sensitive data for unauthorized users, ensuring data protection and compliance.

**Column-level security**: You can restrict access to specific columns within a table, which is useful for sensitive data like personal identification information.

**Dynamic data masking**: Configure data masking rules to obscure sensitive data automatically when queried by unauthorized users.

## Auditing and Monitoring
Unity Catalog maintains detailed audit logs for tracking data access and activities, crucial for compliance, and uses Databricks’ monitoring tools to observe usage and access patterns, helping to pinpoint security issues.

**Audit logs**: Unity Catalog provides detailed audit logs that record data access and other activities. This process is crucial for compliance and monitoring unusual access patterns.

**Monitoring tools**: Use Databricks’ built-in monitoring tools to track usage and access patterns, helping you to identify potential security issues.

## Integrating with External Systems
Unity Catalog’s integration with single-SSO simplifies user authentication and streamlines access management, while external catalog sync ensures consistent governance across different platforms.

**Single sign-on (SSO)**: Integrate Unity Catalog with your existing identity providers through SSO to simplify user authentication and streamline access management.

**External catalog sync**: Sync with external data catalogs to maintain a consistent governance framework across different platforms.

## Best Practices
Some common best practices include simple and consistent review along with peer education.

**Regularly Review Policies**: Data access needs can change, so regularly review and update your access policies to ensure they still meet your security requirements.

**Educate Users**: Make sure that all users understand the importance of data governance and how to use the Unity Catalog safely and effectively.

By carefully setting up and managing access controls with Azure Databricks' Unity Catalog, you can ensure that your data assets are well-governed, secure, and accessible to the right users under the right conditions.
