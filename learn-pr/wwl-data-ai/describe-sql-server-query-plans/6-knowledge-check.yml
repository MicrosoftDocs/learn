      explanation: "That's correct. The estimated execution plan is stored in the plan cache."
    - content: "Actual execution plan"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The actual plan has to be captured at runtime, using profiler, xEvents, or SSMS."
    - content: "Live Query Stats"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Live query stats are only captured at runtime through SSMS."
  - content: "Which DMV should you use to find index utilization?"
    choices:
    - content: "sys.dm_db_index_usage_stats"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. sys.dm_db.index_usage_states shows the read and write operations against each index."
    - content: "sys.dm_db_missing_index_details"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This DMV shows missing indexes recommended by the query optimizer."
    - content: "sys.dm_exec_query_plan_stats"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This DMV shows the last actual execution plan, but does not summarize index utilization."
  - content: "Which of the following wait types would indicate excessive CPU consumption?"
    choices:
    - content: "SOS_SCHEDULER_YIELD"

    - content: "RESOURCE_SEMAPHORE"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This resource wait is associated with memory grant delays."
    - content: "PAGEIOLATCH_SH"
