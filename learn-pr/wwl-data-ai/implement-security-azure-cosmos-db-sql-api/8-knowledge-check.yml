  questions:
  - content: "One reason the request is getting a 403 status code returned is?"
    choices:
    - content: "Because by default Azure Cosmos DB blocks access to all incoming IPs."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Azure Cosmos DB by default allows access to all IPs. A 403 status code means that the connection is forbidden."
    - content: "Because by default Azure Cosmos DB allows access to all incoming IPs."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A 403 status code means that the connection is forbidden so it  doesn't trigger if all IPs are allowed."
    - content: "Because the firewall is enabled, and the application's IP must be added to the firewall's allowed access list."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. If the firewall is enabled, the application's IP must be added to the allowed access list."
  - content: "What' needs to be done to use the Data Explorer with RBAC (Role-Based Access Control?"
    choices:
    - content: "Access the Azure Cosmos DB Data Explorer with the specific `?feature.enableAadDataPlane=true` query parameter and sign-in."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Data Explorer doesn't support RBAC. The proposed solution is to use **Azure Cosmos DB Explorer** to query the data."
    - content: "Use CLI or PowerShell to enable the feature `enableAadDataPlane=true`."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. RBAC data explorer access can't be enabled in any way."
    - content: "Data Explorer doesn't support RBAC."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Data Explorer doesn't support RBAC, to query the data. Use **Azure Cosmos DB Explorer** instead."
  - content: "What is the proper set of steps to set up Always Encrypted for Cosmos DB?"
    choices:
    - content: "Create a CMK (Customer-Managed Keys) in Azure Key Vault. Use the SDK to create the DEK (Data Encryption Key) (with the CMK) on a database, add the DEK and the encryption policies to an existing container."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Always Encrypted can only be set up at the container's creation time and can't modify or add Always Encrypted to an existing container."
    - content: "Create a CMK in Azure Key Vault. Use the SDK to create the DEK (with the CMK) on a database, create a container with the DEK and encryption policies."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Always Encrypted can only be set up at the container's creation time."
    - content: "Create a CMK in Azure Key Vault. Use the SDK to create the DEK (with the CMK) on a new or existing container with the encryption policies."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. First, the DEK needs to be set up on the database. Then, Always Encrypted can only be set up at the container's creation time and can't modify or add Always Encrypted to an existing container."
