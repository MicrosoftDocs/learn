The visual query editor in Microsoft Fabric data warehouse is a tool that provides an intuitive interface for building SQL queries. 

It simplifies the process of writing and managing queries, especially for those who might not be comfortable with SQL syntax.

- **Graphical interface**: The editor provides a graphical interface where you can drag and drop tables, and visually design your queries. This makes it easier to understand the structure of your query and the relationships between tables.

- **Automatic query generation**: As you design your query using the visual interface, the corresponding SQL query is automatically generated. This allows you to focus on the logic of your query, rather than the syntax. All workspace users can save their queries in **My queries** folder.

## Build your query visually

The visual query editor enhances intuitive understanding of data relationships by allowing users to visually organize tables and fields.

Also, the visual query editor is user-friendly, even for those with little to no SQL experience. Nontechnical team members can use it to extract valuable insights from your data, democratizing data access within your organization and speeding up the decision-making process.

Similarly to the SQL query editor, the **Save as table** and **Save as view** options are also available. These features can be useful for reusing your queries or for creating more complex queries based on the results of previous queries.
