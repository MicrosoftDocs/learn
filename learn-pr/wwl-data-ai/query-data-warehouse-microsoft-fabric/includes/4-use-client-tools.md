## Authentication options

In Microsoft Fabric, two types of authenticated users are supported through the SQL connection string:

- Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure Active Directory) user principals, or user identities
- Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure Active Directory) service principals

> [!NOTE] 
> SQL authentication is not supported.

## Other tools

Any third-party tool can use the SQL connection string via ODBC or OLE DB drivers to connect to a Microsoft Fabric Warehouse or SQL analytics endpoint, using Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure Active Directory) authentication.
