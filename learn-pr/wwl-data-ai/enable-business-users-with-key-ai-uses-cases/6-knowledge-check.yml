  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "What is an example of how anyone can use AI to get more done today?"
    choices:
    - content: "AI can be used to replace large groups of workers."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Humans have so many unique capabilities that no machine can replicate—creativity, empathy, inventiveness, and imagination. AI can amplify these capabilities, not replace them."
    - content: "AI can help ease friction points in virtual meetings for remote work scenarios."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. AI capabilities including real-time background noise reduction and live captions and subtitles can help ensure attendees do not miss anything during meetings."
    - content: "AI can independently and automatically generate new sales for businesses."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While AI-powered insights based on customer data can enable sales teams to increase their sales, AI cannot automatically create new sales on its own."
  - content: "Which role(s) are able to build AI models today?"
    choices:
    - content: "Anyone has the ability to create models—regardless of their technical expertise."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. With the release of no-code AI tools and platforms, anyone can create AI models and add AI capabilities to their apps—regardless of their technical experience."
    - content: "Developers and data scientists are the only roles with the level of technical expertise required to develop AI models."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While data scientists and developers have the background to develop complex AI models, these are not the only roles able to build AI models today."
    - content: "Sales and marketing teams are the primary roles building AI models today."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While sales and marketing teams can build AI models using no-code AI tools and platforms, they are not the primary roles building AI models today."
  - content: "What is AI for reasoning?"
    choices:
    - content: "Encouraging subject matter experts to ask developers and data scientists whenever they need an AI model."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Telling a developer or data scientist what they need ahead of time would be at best impractical and more likely impossible."
    - content: "Providing subject matter experts with AI development training so they can build their own AI models."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Training every subject matter expert in AI development would be time-intensive and costly."
    - content: "Enabling your subject matter experts with the ability to choose which AI models to use for different purposes and what information sources to analyze with them."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. AI for reasoning enables subject matter experts to pivot their approach if they have a new idea or new evidence to work with."
