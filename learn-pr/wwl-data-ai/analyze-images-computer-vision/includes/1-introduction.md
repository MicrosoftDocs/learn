*Computer vision* is one of the core areas of artificial intelligence (AI), and focuses on creating solutions that enable AI applications to "see" the world and make sense of it.

Of course, computers don't have biological eyes that work the way ours do, but they're capable of processing images; either from a live camera feed or from digital photographs or videos. This ability to process images is the key to creating software that can emulate human visual perception.

In this module, we'll examine some of the fundamental principles and techniques that underlie computer vision. We'll also introduce **Microsoft Azure AI Vision**, a cloud service that developers can use to create a wide range of computer vision solutions.
