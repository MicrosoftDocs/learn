  questions:
  - content: "You want to use the Computer Vision service to analyze images. You also want to use the Language service to analyze text. You want developers to require only one key and endpoint to access all of your services. What kind of resource should you create in your Azure subscription?"
    choices:
    - content: "Computer Vision"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This resource type only supports image analysis. A separate Language resource (with its own key and endpoint) would be required for text analytics."
    - content: "Cognitive Services"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. A Cognitive Services resource supports both Computer Vision and Language."
    - content: "Custom Vision"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The Custom Vision service is for image classification and object detection, and does not support image analysis or text analysis."
  - content: "You want to use the Computer Vision service to identify the location of individual items in an image. Which of the following features should you retrieve?"
    choices:

      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Computer Vision returns objects with a bounding box to indicate their location in the image."
    - content: "Tags"

      explanation: "Incorrect. Tags indicate the items in an image, but not their location."
    - content: "Categories"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Categories provide suggested categorizations for the image as a whole, not individual items in it."
  - content: "You want to use the Computer Vision service to analyze images of locations and identify well-known buildings. What should you do?"
    choices:
    - content: "Retrieve the objects in the image."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The objects might identify buildings as buildings, but not a specific well-known landmark."
    - content: "Retrieve the categories for the image, specifying the celebrities domain"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The celebrities domain includes well-known people, not buildings."
    - content: "Retrieve the categories for the image, specifying the landmarks domain"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The landmarks domain includes many well-known buildings around the world."
