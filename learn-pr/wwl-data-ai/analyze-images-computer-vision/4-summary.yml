  title: "Knowledge check"
  questions:
  - content: "You want to use the Computer Vision service to analyze images. You also want to use the Text Analytics service to analyze text. You want developers to require only one key and endpoint to access all of your services. What kind of resource should you create in your Azure subscription?"
    choices:
    - content: "Computer Vision"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This resource type only supports image analysis. A separate resource (with its own key and endpoint) would be required for text analytics."

      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. A Cognitive Services resource support both Computer Vision and Text Analytics."
    - content: "Custom Vision"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The Custom Vision service is for image classification and object detection, and does not support image analysis or text analysis."

      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Computer Vision returns objects with a bounding box to indicate their location in the image."

      explanation: "Incorrect. Tags indicate the items in an image, but not their location."
    - content: "Categories"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Categories provide suggested categorizations for the image as a whole, not individual items in it."
  - content: "You want to use the Computer Vision service to determine whether an image is back-and-white or color? What should you do?"
    choices:
    - content: "Generate a thumbnail"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This would create a small version of the image."
    - content: "Retrieve the Image Type feature"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This feature would indicate if the image was likely to be clip art."
    - content: "Retrieve the Color feature"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The Color feature response includes a value that indicates whether or not the image is black-and-white."
