quiz:
  questions:
  - content: "When fine-tuning a model for entity recognition, what type of task should the foundation model be fine-tuned on?"
    choices:
    - content: "Text classification"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Use text classification when you want to categorize text consisting of multiple tokens."
    - content: "Token classification"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Token classification assigns specific labels to individual tokens or words, like with entity recognition."
    - content: "Question answering"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Use question answering when you want to provide answers based on questions."
  - content: "Where can you find foundation models in the Azure Machine Learning studio?"
    choices:
    - content: "On the Model catalog page."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The Model catalog contains all foundation models you can use, and allows you to import more."
    - content: "On the Models page."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The Models page lists all registered models that you trained."
    - content: "On the Endpoints page."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The Endpoints page lists all endpoints to which you can deploy models."
  - content: "What kind of compute do you need to fine-tune a foundation model?"
    choices:
    - content: "A GPU compute instance."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A compute instance can't be used to fine-tune a foundation model."
    - content: "A GPU compute cluster."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. You need a compute cluster with an N-type virtual machine size, which uses GPUs."
    - content: "A CPU compute cluster."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. You need a compute cluster with an N-type virtual machine size, which uses GPUs."
