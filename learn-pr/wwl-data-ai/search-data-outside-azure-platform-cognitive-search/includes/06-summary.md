In this module you've seen how to push data into an Azure AI Search index. Azure Data Factory has an Azure Search linked service that you can use as a sink in a copy data pipeline. The search service supports REST requests to push data into indexes.

You then used code to push data into an index using the best batch size and threading.

By completing this module, you learned how to:

- Use Azure Data Factory to copy data into an Azure AI Search Index.
- Use the Azure AI Search push API to add to an index from any external data source.

If you'd like to learn more about the search REST API, see [Azure AI Search Service REST](/rest/api/searchservice).
