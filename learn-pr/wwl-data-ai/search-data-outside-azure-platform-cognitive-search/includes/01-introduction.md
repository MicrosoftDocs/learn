Azure AI Search supports two main ways to get data into a search index. So far, you've seen how to *pull* data using indexers. The most flexible way to get data into an index is to *push* the data into it.

By the end of this module, you'll learn how to:

- Use Azure Data Factory to copy data into an Azure AI Search Index.
- Use the Azure AI Search push API to add to an index from any external data source.
