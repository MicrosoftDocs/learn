  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "What calculation item property should a report creator define to allow conditional application of format strings to measures?"
    choices:
    - content: "Dynamic format strings."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Dynamic format strings enable report creators to overwrite the format string by setting the format string expression property."
    - content: "Precedence."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Precedence is defined for calculation groups, not calculation items."
    - content: "Ordering."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The ordinal property does not allow conditional application of format strings to measures."
  - content: "What limitation of calculation groups should Power BI report authors be aware of?"
    choices:
    - content: "There are no limitations of calculation groups."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. There are limitations of calculation groups that report authors should be aware of."
    - content: "Applying calculation groups to a model disables the use of implicit measures in a Power BI report."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Implicit measures are not supported in reports with calculation groups applied."
    - content: "Applying calculation groups disables the ability to refresh data models in the Power BI service."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Applying calculation groups does not disable the ability to automate refreshes in the Power BI service."
  - content: "Authors working with data models containing multiple calculation groups must be sure to specify what to control the order of application of calculation groups?"
    choices:
    - content: "Ordering."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Ordering refers to calculation items rather than calculation groups."
    - content: "Precedence."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Power BI provides secure distribution and sharing options for distribution of insights across an organization."
    - content: "Calculation group name."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Calculation group naming does not have an impact on the order of application of calculation groups."
