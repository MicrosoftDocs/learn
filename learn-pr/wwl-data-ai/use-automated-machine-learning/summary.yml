  title: "Knowledge check"
  questions:
  - content: "An automobile dealership wants to use historic car sales data to train a machine learning model. The model should predict the price of a pre-owned car based on characteristics like its age, engine size, and mileage. What kind of machine learning model does the dealership need to create?"
    choices:
    - content: "Classification"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That is incorrect. To predict a numeric value, use a regression model."
    - content: "Regression"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That is correct. To predict a numeric value, use a regression model."
    - content: "Clustering"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That is incorrect. To predict a numeric value, use a regression model."
  - content: "A bank wants to use historic loan repayment records to categorize loan applications as low-risk or high-risk based on characteristics like the loan amount, the income of the borrower, and the loan period. What kind of machine learning model does the bank need to create?"
    choices:
    - content: "Classification"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That is correct. To predict a category, or class, use a classification model."
    - content: "Regression"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That is incorrect. To predict a category, or class, use a classification model."
    - content: "Clustering"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That is incorrect. To predict a category, or class, use a classification model."
  - content: "Which of the following types of machine learning is an example of unsupervised machine learning?"
    choices:
    - content: "Classification"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That is incorrect. classification and regression are supervised machine learning, clustering is unsupervised."
    - content: "Regression"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That is incorrect. classification and regression are supervised machine learning, clustering is unsupervised."
    - content: "Clustering"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That is correct. classification and regression are supervised machine learning, clustering is unsupervised."
