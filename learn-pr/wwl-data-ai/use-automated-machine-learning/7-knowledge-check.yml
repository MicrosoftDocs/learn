  questions:
  - content: "An automobile dealership wants to use historic car sales data to train a machine learning model. The model should predict the price of a pre-owned car based on its make, model, engine size, and mileage. What kind of machine learning model should the dealership use automated machine learning to create?"
    choices:
    - content: "Classification"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. To predict a numeric value, use a regression model."
    - content: "Regression"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. To predict a numeric value, use a regression model."
    - content: "Time series forecasting"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. To predict a numeric value, use a regression model."
  - content: "A bank wants to use historic loan repayment records to categorize loan applications as low-risk or high-risk based on characteristics like the loan amount, the income of the borrower, and the loan period. What kind of machine learning model should the bank use automated machine learning to create?"
    choices:
    - content: "Classification"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. To predict a category, or class, use a classification model."
    - content: "Regression"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. To predict a category, or class, use a classification model."
    - content: "Time series forecasting"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. To predict a category, or class, use a classification model."
  - content: "You want to use automated machine learning to train a regression model with the best possible *R2 score*. How should you configure the automated machine learning experiment?"
    choices:
    - content: "Set the Primary metric to R2 score"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The primary metric determines the metric used to evaluate the best performing model."
    - content: "Block all algorithms other than GradientBoosting"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The choice of algorithms does not determine the metric used to evaluate the best performing model."
    - content: "Enable featurization"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Enabling featurization does not determine the metric used to evaluate the best performing model."
