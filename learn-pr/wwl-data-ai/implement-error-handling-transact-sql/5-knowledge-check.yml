  questions:
  - content: "You're writing some error handling in a T-SQL script. If a problem arises, you want to raise an error with a severity of 20. Which command would you use to for this type of error handling?"
    choices:
    - content: "THROW"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. THROW always sets the severity of an error to 16, which prevents you raising a severity level of 20."
    - content: "RAISERROR"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. RAISERROR lets you set the severity level, and will allow you to raise an error with a severity of 20."
    - content: "@@ERROR"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. @@ERROR won't  let you set the severity level."
  - content: "How can you THROW outside of a CATCH block?"
    choices:
    - content: "With arguments that raise a user-defined error."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Developing your own custom errors is the only means to THROW outside a TRY/CATCH block."
    - content: "With a conditional EXCEPTION clause"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The EXCEPTION statement isn't valid."
    - content: "With a RAISERROR argument."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The RAISERROR command won't  THROW an error."
  - content: "In what situation would you use @@ERROR?"
    choices:
    - content: "To throw an error code."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. @@ERROR holds the last error code."
    - content: "To trigger an alert"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. @@EROR will return the last error code."
    - content: "To capture the last error code."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. @@ERROR can be assigned to a variable and contains the last error code."
