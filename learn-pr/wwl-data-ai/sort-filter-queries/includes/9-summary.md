In this module, you learned how to:

- Sort the results of a query by using the ORDER BY clause
- Limit the sorted results to show only the top *n* rows
- Return paged results
- Remove duplicates from results
- Filter data with predicates in the WHERE clause

Here is a **[video tutorial](/shows/programming-databases-with-t-sql-for-beginners/sort-and-filter-results-in-transact-sql-3-of-7-programming-databases-with-t-sql-for-beginners)** accompanying this training module to enhance your learning experience.

For more detailed information about Transact-SQL syntax, refer to the [Transact-SQL reference documentation](/sql/t-sql/language-reference).
