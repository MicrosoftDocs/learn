When you retrieve data from a database, you will often want to sort the data into a particular order, or filter it to include only the rows that meet specific criteria.

The Transact-SQL SELECT statement supports sorting query results by applying the ORDER BY clause, and filtering results using the WHERE clause.


In this module, you will learn how to:

- Sort the results of a query by using the ORDER BY clause
- Limit the sorted results to show only the top *n* rows
- Return paged results
- Remove duplicates from results
- Filter data with predicates in the WHERE clause
