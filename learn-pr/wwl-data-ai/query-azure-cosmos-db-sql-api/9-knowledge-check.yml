  questions:
  - content: "The developer team is tasked with writing the shortest possible NoSQL query to select all items and include all fields from a container. Which of these queries is both valid and would accomplish this task?"
    choices:
    - content: "``SELECT FROM``"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This query is missing the data source and the specification for which fields should be returned."
    - content: "``SELECT FROM p``"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This query is missing the specification for which fields should be returned."
    - content: "``SELECT * FROM p``"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. This query includes the data source and the specification for which fields should be returned."
  - content: "Which SQL keyword is used to flatten the query results into an array of a specific field value for each item?"
    choices:
    - content: "``FROM``"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The ``FROM`` keyword specifies the data source."
    - content: "``VALUE``"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The ``VALUE`` keyword specifies that the JSON value should be retrieved for each item instead of the complete object."
    - content: "``DISTINCT``"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The ``DISTINCT`` keyword specifies that duplicates should be removed."
  - content: "The database has a container named products. What must the data source be named after the ``FROM`` keyword in the query?"
    choices:
    - content: "p"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The data source doesn't necessarily need to be named the same as the first letter of the container."
    - content: "products"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The data source doesn't necessarily need to be named the same as the container."
    - content: "Either of these names"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The data source can have a unique name that's distinct from the container's name."
