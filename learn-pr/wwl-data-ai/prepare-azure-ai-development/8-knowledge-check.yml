      explanation: "Incorrect. Azure AI Vision provides only vision services."
    - content: "Azure AI Services"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Azure AI Services provides multiple services from a single endpoint."
  - content: "How should you provide access to resources for developers who will work on multiple AI projects?"
    choices:
    - content: "Create resource connections in an Azure AI Foundry hub."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Creating resource connections in a hub means they can be used from all projects created in that hub."
    - content: "Create resource connections in each Azure AI Foundry project."

    - content: "Semantic Kernel SDK"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The Semantic Kernel SDK is used to build generative AI apps and doesn't rely on connections in a hub."
    - content: "Azure AI Foundry SDK"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The Azure AI Foundry SDK provides the AI Projects client library, which you can use to access connections in a project or hub."
