Music is a powerful way to create the mood and atmosphere of your destination. It can also express your theme and personality. How about making a playlist that matches your vision? You can use songs from different genres, artists, and languages to craft your own soundtrack. Use  Copilot in Bing to create your playlist.

## Ideate
Ask Copilot to create a list of 10 songs that would be appropriate for your destination. Add any details or references to help guide Copilot. You're going to format this list as a table.

> [!TIP]
> **Get creative with directions**. Add details to get more interesting results. Ask for one-hit wonders, indie artists, provide references to other soundtracks, or describe the vibe you are going for.

**Steps**:
1. Copy the sample prompt and edit as desired.
2. Paste the prompt into the chat.
3. Take a screen capture of the table of songs it gave you, and save that image.

**Sample prompt**:
``` 
We need to think about music. This part of the project 
is called The Music. 
Can you create a table of 10 songs with the 
Artist and Song Name that 
would fit the theme of this destination? 

```

**Sample response**:

Note the following sample response is in markdown syntax so it doesn't look formatted like a table the way it does in your browser.
```
| Artist     | Song Title    
|--------------|-----------
|Louis Armstrong | When You're Smiling
|Duke Ellington | It Don't Mean a Thing ( if it Ain't
Got that Swing)
| Billie Holiday | Summertime
| Benny Goodman | Sing, Sing, Sing
| Ella Fitzgerald | A-Tisket, A-Tasket
| Cab Calloway | Minnie the Moocher 
| Glenn Miller | In the Mood

```
