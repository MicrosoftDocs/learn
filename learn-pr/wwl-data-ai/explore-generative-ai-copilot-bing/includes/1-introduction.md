Each step in this module focuses on a different part of the experience and provides a sample prompt you can copy and edit. The structure of the steps and the prompts are created to highlight specific techniques or functionality. Sample responses are provided to show you examples of the content Copilot creates.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In this tutorial you only work in Copilot in Bing. However, you must sign in to Image Creator so the copilot can use it to do the work of calling Image Creator for you. If you get an error from the copilot, it means that Copilot in Bing is unable to call Image Creator because you are not signed in.

**Pull it all together**

As you create everything you need to describe your idea and destination, save it. You can copy your AI-generated content into another format, such as a Microsoft PowerPoint presentation, to further refine and share with others.
