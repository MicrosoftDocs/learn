  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "What is provisioning?"
    choices:
    - content: "The act of running series of tasks that a service provider performs to create and configure a service."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. In Azure, you must provision a service before you can use it."
    - content: "Providing other users access to an existing service."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Providing other users access to an existing service is the description of security configuration."
    - content: "Tuning a service to improve performance."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This is tuning and optimization."
  - content: "What is a security principal?"
    choices:
    - content: "A named collection of permissions that can be granted to a service, such as the ability to use the service to read, write, and delete data. In Azure, examples include **Owner** and **Contributor**."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This is the definition of a security role."
    - content: "A set of resources managed by a service to which you can grant access."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This is the definition of a security scope."
    - content: "An object that represents a user, group, service, or managed identity that is requesting access to Azure resources."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Azure authentication uses security principles to help determine whether a request to access a service should be granted."
  - content: "Which of the following is an advantage of using multi-region replication with Cosmos DB?"
    choices:
    - content: "Data will always be consistent in every region."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. There will be a time lag between writing data in one region, and replicating the data to the other regions. During this period, the data is inconsistent across regions."
    - content: "Availability is increased."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Replication improves availability. If one region becomes inaccessible, the data is still available in other regions."
    - content: "Increased security for your data."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Replication doesn't increase the security of your data."
