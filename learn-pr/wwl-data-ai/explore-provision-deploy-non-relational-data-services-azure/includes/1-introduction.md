Most software applications need to store data. Often this takes the form of a relational database, in which the data is organized in related tables and managed by using Structured Query Language (SQL). However, many applications don't need the rigid structure of a relational database and rely on non-relational (often referred to as NoSQL) storage.

Azure Storage is one of the core services in Microsoft Azure, and offers a range of options for storing data in the cloud. In this module, you explore the fundamental capabilities of Azure storage and learn how it's used to support applications that require non-relational data stores.
