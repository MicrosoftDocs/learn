  questions:
  - content: "What distribution option would you use for a product dimension table that will contain 1,000 records in Synapse Analytics?"
    choices:
    - content: "DISTRIBUTION = ROUND_ROBIN."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Round-Robin distribution will keep even distribution across compute nodes but lead to data shuffling when joining to a distributed fact table."
    - content: "DISTRIBUTION = HASH([ProductId])."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Hash distribution will distribute across compute nodes but lead to data shuffling when joining to a distributed fact table."
    - content: "DISTRIBUTION = REPLICATE."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Replicate will result in a copy of the table on each compute node, which performs well with joins to the distributed fact table."
  - content: "What distribution option would be best for a sales fact table that will contain billions of records?"
    choices:
    - content: "DISTRIBUTION = HASH([SalesOrderNumber])."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Hash distribution provides good read performance for a large table by distributing records across compute nodes based on the hash key."
    - content: "DISTRIBUTION = HEAP."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Heap is not a distribution option."
    - content: "DISTRIBUTION = REPLICATE."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Replicate will result in a copy of the table on each compute node, which is not optimal for a large table."
  - content: "What is the difference between a star schema and a snowflake schema?"
    choices:
    - content: "A star schema uses surrogate keys while a snowflake schema uses business keys."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Surrogate keys may be used in either star schema or snowflake schema."
    - content: "All dimensions in a star schema join directly to the fact table (denormalized) while some dimension tables in a snowflake schema are normalized."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. A star schema is highly denormalized so that the fact table joins directly to dimension; a snowflake schema normalizes some dimensions into multiple tables such as DimProduct, DimProductSubcategory, and DimProductCategory."
    - content: "All dimensions in a star schema are normalized while all dimensions in a snowflake schema join directly to the fact table (denormalized)."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A snowflake schema joins the fact table to dimensions that have been normalized into multiple tables."
    - content: "A star schema has one fact table while a snowflake schema has multiple fact tables."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. These two schema types refer to how dimensions are structured and not how many fact tables are involved."
