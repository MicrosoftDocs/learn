In this module, you've explored the key concepts behind Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) using Azure Databricks. RAG enhances generative AI models by dynamically retrieving relevant information from external data sources to provide more accurate and contextually relevant responses.

By completing this module, you have learned about:

- **RAG workflow components** - Understanding the pipeline from data ingestion to response generation
- **Data preparation for RAG** - How documents are transformed into searchable chunks and text embeddings using Azure OpenAI
- **Vector search concepts** - How Mosaic AI Vector Search finds similar content based on semantic meaning
- **Search result optimization** - Understanding similarity scoring and optional reranking techniques

Key concepts you've explored include data chunking, text embeddings, vector search, similarity scoring, and reranking techniques.

You now have a foundational understanding of RAG workflows in Azure Databricks. The hands-on exercise has given you practical experience with the core components, providing a starting point for further exploration.
