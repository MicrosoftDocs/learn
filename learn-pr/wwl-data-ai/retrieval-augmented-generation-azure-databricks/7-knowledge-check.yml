  questions:
  - content: "What is the primary advantage of using vector embeddings in Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) on Azure Databricks?"
    choices:
    - content: "Faster data ingestion."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Faster data ingestion isn't the primary advantage of using vector embeddings in RAG on Azure Databricks."
    - content: "More relevant search results."  
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Vector embeddings allow for more accurate and contextually relevant search results by capturing the semantic meaning of data. Vector embeddings enable the RAG system to retrieve information based on meaning rather than just keywords, which significantly enhance the quality of the responses generated by the model."
    - content: "Reduced storage requirements."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Reduced storage requirements aren't the primary advantage of using vector embeddings in RAG on Azure Databricks."
  - content: "Which component of a RAG workflow in Azure Databricks is responsible for transforming user queries into a format suitable for the retrieval process?"
    choices:
    - content: "Data ingestion"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Data ingestion isn't responsible for transforming user queries into a format suitable for retrieval process."
    - content: "Query vectorization"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Query vectorization is the process of converting user queries into vector embeddings using the same embedding model that was used to create the data vectors. This step ensures that the query can be compared semantically with the stored data vectors to retrieve the most relevant information​."
    - content: "Embedding storage"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Embedding storage isn't responsible for transforming user queries into a format suitable for retrieval process."
  - content: "In the context of improving RAG application quality on Azure Databricks, what does retrieval quality refer to?"
    choices:
    - content: "The efficiency of data storage solutions."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The efficiency of data storage solutions doesn't relate to retrieval quality."
    - content: "The accuracy of the information retrieved for a given query."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Retrieval quality pertains to how accurately the RAG system retrieves relevant information for a given query. High retrieval quality ensures that the context given to the LLM (Large Language Model) is relevant and complete, which is essential for accurate and coherent responses​."
    - content: "The speed at which the model generates responses."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The speed at which the model generates responses doesn't relate to retrieval quality."
