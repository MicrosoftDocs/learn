In this module, you learned about database normalization and its three main forms: first, second, and third normal forms. You've also explored the concept of denormalization and its application in data warehouses through models like star schema and snowflake schema. The module also covered SQL Server's range of data types and the impact of their selection on performance. You learned about implicit and explicit conversion of data types and the use of `CAST` or `CONVERT` functions to enforce data type conversion. Lastly, you've been introduced to SQL Server's system-supplied data types and the creation of user-defined data types using T-SQL or the .NET framework.

The main takeaways from this module include understanding the importance of database normalization and denormalization, and how they can influence database performance. You learned how to optimize storage and enhance query performance by choosing appropriate data types and using explicit conversion when necessary. You also gained knowledge about SQL Server's index types, including clustered and nonclustered indexes, and their role in optimizing different workloads. Furthermore, you learned about the considerations for index design, such as understanding system workloads, optimizing indexes around frequently run queries, and choosing appropriate data types for columns.
