Database design is an important aspect of database performance, even though it’s not always under the control of the database administrator. You may be working with third-party vendor applications that you didn't build. Whenever possible, it’s important to design your database properly for the workload, whether it’s an online transaction processing (OLTP) or data warehouse workload. Many design decisions, such as choosing the right datatypes, can make large differences in the performance of your databases.
