  questions:
  - content: "To restore a periodic backup you must?"
    choices:
    - content: "In the Azure portal Azure Cosmos DB page, select *Restore*"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This option allows you to restore a deleted Azure Cosmos DB account."
    - content: "Open a ticket with the Azure support team to restore the backup for you"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. You can't restore an Azure Cosmos DB account or any of its data, only the Azure support team can do that, so a support ticket must be opened to restore the data."
    - content: "Under Azure Cosmos DB account Data Explorer, run the SQL Query **restore from \"AZUREBLOBSTORAGEPATH\"**, replace AZUREBLOBSTORAGEPATH for the URL of your backup file."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Data Explorer is used to query the Azure Cosmos DB account data, the restore command doesn't exist."
  - content: "Which of the following options must you configure for continuous backup mode to work properly?"
    choices:
    - content: "Backup storage redundancy."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Backup storage redundancy is a periodic backup setting, for the continuous backup mode, there's no need to configure intervals, retention, or storage redundancy."
    - content: "Retention period."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Retention period is a periodic backup setting, for the continuous backup mode, there's no need to configure intervals, retention, or storage redundancy."
    - content: "Continuous backup mode doesn't require any setting to be configured."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Unlike periodic backups, there's no need to configure intervals, retention, or storage redundancy."
  - content: "What is a limitation of using continuous backup mode?"
    choices:
    - content: "You can only restore over the existing Azure Cosmos DB account at the container level."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Restores never overwrite any part of an existing Azure Cosmos DB account, all restores create a brand new Azure Cosmos DB account."
    - content: "Multi-region write accounts not supported."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Currently continuous backups are only supported for an Azure Cosmos DB account configured for single-write region."
    - content: "Firewall and VNET settings are only recovered for the restored Azure Cosmos DB account region."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Continuous backup mode doesn't restore any Firewall, VNET, private endpoint settings."
