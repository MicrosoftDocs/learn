Azure Cognitive Search is a cloud-native search service that provides an expanded set of query functionality over a large variety and volume of data. A search service is ideal for scenarios where your developer team would like to implement search-specific features such as filters, faceting, autocomplete, and synonym matching without the complexity of trying to implement these features directly in the database source. In this module, you will explore how Azure Cognitive Search can crawl data from the Azure Cosmos DB SQL API.

After completing this module, you'll be able to:

- Create an indexer to migrate data from Azure Cosmos DB SQL API to an Azure Cognitive Search index
