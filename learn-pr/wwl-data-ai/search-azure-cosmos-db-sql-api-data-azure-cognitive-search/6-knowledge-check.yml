  questions:
  - content: "To enable the ability to index changes in Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL items, which field should be included in the data source's SQL query?"
    choices:
    - content: "``partitionKey``"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The partition key path may not necessarily be ``/partitionKey``. Additionally, the partition key is unrelated to the high watermark policy."
    - content: "``id``"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The id is useful for creating a unique identifier for JSON in the search index, but it's unrelated to the high watermark policy."
    - content: "``_ts``"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The ``_ts`` field is required to enable the high watermark policy to track changes to existing items."
  - content: "The Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL sales application regularly uses a time-to-live value to automatically delete items after a set amount of time. Which strategy should the application use to ensure that the deleted items are also deleted in the search index?"
    choices:
    - content: "Configure a soft-delete policy with a tracked column and value"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. A soft-delete column and value is required to enable the soft-deleted column deletion detection policy."
    - content: "No configuration is required. Azure Cognitive Search automatically removes data from the index"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Azure Cognitive Search doesn't automatically remove JSON from an index if the corresponding item is deleted in Azure Cosmos DB."
    - content: "Configure a high watermark policy that is mapped to the timestamp (_ts) field"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The high watermark policy is related to tracking changes, not deleting items."
