abstract: |
  By the end of this module, you learn to:
  - Explain how nodes, variables, and agent outputs control workflow execution  
  - Route requests using structured outputs and conditional logic  
  - Loop over multiple inputs with For-Each nodes  
  - Use human-in-the-loop and escalation patterns for low-confidence items
  - Utilize Power Fx expressions to manipulate data and control flow.
