  questions:
  - content: "You have trained a classification model, and you want to quantify the influence of each feature on a specific individual prediction. What should you examine?"
    choices:
    - content: "Global feature importance"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That is incorrect. Global importance gives an overall indication of feature influence."
    - content: "Local feature importance"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That is correct. Local importance indicates the influence of features on a specific prediction. Global importance gives an overall indication of feature influence."
    - content: "Recall and Precision"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That is incorrect. Recall and precision are metrics that quantify the model's predictive performance, not feature importance."
  - content: "Which explainer uses an architecture-appropriate SHAP algorithm to interpret a model?"
    choices:
    - content: "PFIExplainer"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That is incorrect. A PFIExplainer analyzes feature importance by shuffling feature values and measuring the impact on prediction performance."
    - content: "MimicExplainer"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That is incorrect. A MimicExplainer explainer creates a global surrogate model that approximates your trained model and can be used to generate explanations. This explainable model must have the same kind of architecture as your trained model (for example, linear or tree-based)."
    - content: "TabularExplainer"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That is correct. A TabularExplainer acts as a wrapper around various SHAP explainer algorithms, automatically choosing the one that is most appropriate for your model architecture."
