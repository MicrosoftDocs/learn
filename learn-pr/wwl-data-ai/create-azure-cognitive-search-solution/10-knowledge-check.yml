quiz:
  questions:
  - content: "You want to find information in Microsoft Word documents that are stored in an Azure Storage blob container. What should you do to ensure the files can be accessed by Azure Cognitive Search?"
    choices:
    - content: "Add a JSON file that defines an Azure Cognitive Search index to the blob container"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Adding an index file to the blob container does not help Azure Cognitive Search access the data."
    - content: "Enable anonymous access for the blob container"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Anonymous access is not required for Azure Cognitive Search to access documents in a blob container."
    - content: "In an Azure Cognitive Services resource, and add a data source that references the container where the files are stored"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. To search files in a blob container, you should create a data source"
  - content: "You are creating an index that includes a field named modified_date. You want to ensure that the modified_date field can be included in search results. Which attribute must you apply to the modified_date field in the index definition?"
    choices:
    - content: "searchable"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Making a field searchable means that it can be queried for search terms. It does not mean the field can be included in the results."
    - content: "filterable"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Making a field filterable means that it can be used to apply a filter expression. It does not mean the field can be included in the results."
    - content: "retrievable"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. To enable a field to be included in the results, you must make it retrievable."
  - content: "You have created a data source and an index. What must you create to map the data values in the data source to the fields in the index?"
    choices:
    - content: "A synonym map"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A synonym map does not map data to index fields."
    - content: "An indexer"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Use an indexer to map data to index fields."
    - content: "A suggester"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A suggester does not map data to index fields."
  - content: "You want to create a search solution that uses a built-in AI skill to determine the language in which each indexed document is written, and enrich the index with a field indicating the language. Which kind of Azure Cognitive Search object must you create?"
    choices:
    - content: "Synonym map"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A synonym map does not integrate AI skills into the indexing process."
    - content: "Skillset"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. A skillset enables you to define an enrichment pipeline composed of AI skills."
    - content: "Scoring Profile"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A scoring profile does not integrate AI skills into the indexing process."
  - content: "You want your search solution to show results in descending order of the file_size field value. What is the simplest way to accomplish this goal?"
    choices:
    - content: "Create a scoring profile that boosts results based on the file_size field"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A scoring profile calculates a relevancy score based on factors like term-frequency. You can boost scores based on a field, such as file_size; but other factors are also considered in the overall score."
    - content: "Make the file_size field facetable, and include a facet parameter that specifies the file_size field in queries."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Making a field facetable has no effect on the ordering of search results."
    - content: "Make the file_size field sortable, and include an orderby parameter that specifies the file_size field in queries."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Making a field sortable enables you to apply an orderby parameter to sort results by that field."
  - content: "You have created a search solution. Users want to be able to enter a partial search expression and have the user interface automatically complete the input. What should you add to the index?"
    choices:
    - content: "A suggester"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. A suggester makes it possible to implement autocomplete and suggestions."
    - content: "A synonym map."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A synonym map does not enable you to implement autocomplete."
    - content: "A scoring profile."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A scoring profile does not enable you to implement autocomplete."
