quiz:
  questions:
  - content: "How must data be formatted for fine-tuning?"
    choices:
    - content: "JSONL"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. JSONL or JSON Lines is the expected input format."
    - content: "YAML"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. In the context of the Azure AI Foundry, YAML is used to specify the configuration of jobs or flows."
    - content: "HTML"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. HTML is a markup language for web pages."
  - content: "What does fine-tuning optimize in your model?"
    choices:
    - content: "What the model needs to know."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. To optimize what the model needs to know, RAG is more effective."
    - content: "How the model needs to act."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Fine-tuning can help to maximize the consistency of the model's behavior."
    - content: "Which words aren't allowed."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. To filter specific content like words, you can use a content filter."
  - content: "Which advanced option refers to one full cycle through the training dataset?"
    choices:
    - content: "seed"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The seed controls the reproducibility of the job."
    - content: "batch_size"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The batch size specifies the number of training examples used."
    - content: "n_epochs"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. When you set the number of epochs, you set the number of full cycles to run through the dataset."
