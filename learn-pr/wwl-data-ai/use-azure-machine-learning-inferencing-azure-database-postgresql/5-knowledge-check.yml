quiz:
  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "You want to estimate the nightly rental price of a property based on various factors, such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and location. Which of the following is the best type of machine learning model to use for this scenario?"
    choices:
    - content: "Classification."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A classification model aims to predict a category or class label. In this case, you want to predict a continuous value, the nightly rental price."
    - content: "Clustering."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The goal of a clustering model is to group similar data points. In this case, you want to predict a specific value given some set of inputs."
    - content: "Regression."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The goal of a regression model is to predict a specific value given some set of inputs. In this case, you want to predict the nightly rental price of a property, which is a continuous value."
  - content: "Which settings do you need to configure in Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server database to support calling an Azure Machine Learning model?"
    choices:
    - content: "`azure_cognitive.subscription_key`."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The `azure_cognitive` schema is used for calling Azure Cognitive Services, not Azure Machine Learning."
    - content: "`azure_ml.subscription_key`."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. There's no `subscription_key` setting for Azure Machine Learning."
    - content: "`azure_ml.scoring_endpoint`."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The `azure_ml.scoring_endpoint` setting specifies the endpoint for the Azure Machine Learning model you want to call."
  - content: "In the call to `azure_ml.inference()`, what is the data type of the `input_data` parameter?"
    choices:
    - content: "Jsonb."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The `input_data` parameter should be a JSON object in binary representation that contains the input data for the Azure Machine Learning model."
    - content: "Json."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The `input_data` parameter should be a JSON object, not one stored in plain text format."
    - content: "Text."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The `input_data` parameter must be in a JSON format."
