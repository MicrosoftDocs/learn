In your start-up technology company, you have several open-source databases that were created when the organization was part of a university department. Now that you're building a global company and anticipate rapid growth around the world, you want to ensure that these databases can grow fast and be available to all parts of the world where your staff will work. By hosting MySQL, MariaDB, and PostgreSQL in Azure, you benefit from Azure's global infrastructure and instant scaling.

To build such an infrastructure on-premises would require several expensive and robust data centers located around the world. This would take time to implement, and skilled technicians to configure and run. Azure technologies such as Azure Database for MySQL, Azure Database for MariaDB, and Azure Database for PostgreSQL, enable you to implement global database infrastructures quickly and with lower costs.
