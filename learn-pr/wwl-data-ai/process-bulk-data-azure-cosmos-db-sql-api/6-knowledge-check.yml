  questions:
  - content: "Which property of the **CosmosClientOptions** class enables the ability to run multiple operations concurrently and transparently at scale?"
    choices:
    - content: "AllowBulkExecution"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. This property enables optimistic batching of requests for nonlatency sensitive scenarios."
    - content: "ConnectionMode"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This property configures the current connection mode of the client."
    - content: "LimitToEndpoint"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This property limits the ability of the client to discover new read and write endpoints."
  - content: "Which one of these statements is considered a best practice when working with the bulk features of the SDK?"
    choices:
    - content: "Stream APIs aren't compatible with the bulk features of the SDK."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The Stream features of the Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL SDK are compatible the bulk feature of the SDK."
    - content: "Assume that bulk saves you on actual throughput costs versus individual operations."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Bulk operations actually will typically use more throughput than the typical individual operation counterparts."
    - content: "Configure the partition key for each operation configured in a set of tasks."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Configuring the partition key for individual operations will save the SDK from having to compute the partition key on a per operation basis."
