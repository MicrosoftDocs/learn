Running a successful Azure Cognitive Search solution requires you to understand how to maintain its two primary workloads of indexing and querying. It's essential that the search solution is as cost effective as possible. 

In this module, you'll learn how you can take steps to run and maintain a successful search solution. You'll see how to secure your search service, keep it performant, manage the cost of the service, improve reliability, and monitor performance. You'll then look at the tools available to debug errors and warnings, and then complete an exercise to remove warnings on a search indexer.

> [!NOTE]
> This module assumes you already know how to create and use an Azure Cognitive Search solution that includes built-in skills. If not, complete the [Create an Azure Cognitive Search solution](/learn/modules/create-azure-cognitive-search-solution/) module first.
