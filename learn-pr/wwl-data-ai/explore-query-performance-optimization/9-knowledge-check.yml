quiz:
  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "Which type of execution plan is stored in the plan cache?"
    choices:
    - content: "Estimated execution plan"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. The estimated execution plan is stored in the plan cache."
    - content: "Actual execution plan"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The actual plan has to be captured at runtime, using profiler, xEvents, or SSMS."
    - content: "Live Query Stats"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Live query stats are only captured at runtime through SSMS."
  - content: "Which DMV should you use to find index utilization?"
    choices:
    - content: "sys.dm_db_index_usage_stats"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. sys.dm_db_index_usage_stats shows the read and write operations against each index."
    - content: "sys.dm_db_missing_index_details"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This DMV shows missing indexes recommended by the query optimizer."
    - content: "sys.dm_exec_query_plan_stats"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This DMV shows the last actual execution plan, but does not summarize index utilization."
  - content: "Which of the following wait types would indicate excessive CPU consumption?"
    choices:
    - content: "SOS_SCHEDULER_YIELD"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. The SOS_SCHEDULER_YIELD wait is the only one of these wait types that is associated with CPU."
    - content: "RESOURCE_SEMAPHORE"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This resource wait is associated with memory grant delays."
    - content: "PAGEIOLATCH_SH"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This wait is associated with IO completion."
  - content: "Which isolation level should you choose if you want to prevent users reading data from blocking users writing data?"
    choices:
    - content: "Serializable"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This level will block writes from occurring while data is being read."
    - content: "Read Committed Snapshot Isolation"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. The level allows each reader to have their own version of the data and prevents readers from blocking writers."
    - content: "Repeatable Read"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This level also blocks writes from occurring while data is being read."
