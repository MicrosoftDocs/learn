Now it's your opportunity to create a dataflow yourself. 

In this exercise, you'll use a provided script to provision an Azure Synapse Analytics workspace in your Azure subscription. You'll then create a dataflow to deliver date dimension data sourced from the Azure Synapse Adventure Works data warehouse. The dataflow will provide a consistent definition of date-related data for use by the organization's business analysts.
