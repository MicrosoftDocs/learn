title: Implement event messaging with Azure Managed Redis
summary: Learn how to implement event messaging with Azure Managed Redis, including pub/sub for broadcasting notifications and Redis Streams for reliable async task processing. This module covers building real-time notification systems and coordinating multi-step processing pipelines.
abstract: |
  After completing this module, you'll be able to: 
    - Explain Redis pub/sub messaging for broadcasting events to multiple AI services simultaneously
    - Implement Redis Streams for reliable task queues with automatic retry and failure recovery
    - Choose between pub/sub and Streams based on whether you need broadcast or coordinated work distribution
    - Build Python applications that use pub/sub for notifications and Streams for processing pipelines
prerequisites: |
  Before beginning this module, you should have:
  - Programming experience with languages such as Python, JavaScript, or C#.
  - Basic understanding of Azure services and cloud computing concepts.
  - Familiarity with asynchronous programming and distributed system concepts.
  - Basic understanding of message queuing patterns and when to use them for decoupling services.
