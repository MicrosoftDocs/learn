  questions:
  - content: What is the primary advantage of Dynamic Data Masking (DDM)?
    choices:
    - content: It limits data exposure by obscuring sensitive information in real time.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. DDM enhances security by applying dynamic masking to sensitive data in real time, thus preventing exposure to unauthorized users.
    - content: It changes the actual data in the database.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. DDM doesn't change the actual data in the database. It only masks it in query results.
    - content: It requires complex coding to implement.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. DDM is straightforward to implement and doesn’t require complex coding.
  - content: What is the purpose of a security predicate function in Row-Level Security (RLS)?
    choices:
    - content: It determines whether a row is accessible to a user based on certain conditions.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. The security predicate function in RLS is defined to return true or false based on certain conditions, typically involving the values of one or more columns in the table.
    - content: It enables type conversions in predicate functions.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. The security predicate function doesn't enable type conversions. It returns true or false based on certain conditions, typically involving the values of one or more columns in the table.
    - content: It allows users to run ad hoc queries.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. The security predicate function doesn't allow users to run ad hoc queries. It determines whether a row is accessible to a user based on certain conditions.
  - content: What happens when a user is granted a permission and then denied the same permission in a warehouse?
    choices:
    - content: The GRANT statement supersedes the DENY, and the user will have access to the specific object.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. If a user is granted a permission and then denied the same permission, the DENY always supersedes the GRANT.
    - content: The DENY always supersedes the GRANT, and the user is denied access to the specific object.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. If a user is granted a permission and then denied the same permission, the DENY always supersedes the GRANT.
    - content: The user has both permissions, and it causes a conflict.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. There isn't a conflict. The DENY statement always supersedes the GRANT statement.
