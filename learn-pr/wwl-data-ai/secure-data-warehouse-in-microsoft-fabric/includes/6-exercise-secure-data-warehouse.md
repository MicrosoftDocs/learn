Now it's your chance to secure a warehouse in Microsoft Fabric.

In this exercise, you’ll learn how to secure a warehouse using the concepts explored in this module.

> [!NOTE]
> - You need a Microsoft Fabric trial license with the Fabric preview enabled in your tenant. See [**Getting started with Fabric**](/fabric/get-started/fabric-trial?azure-portal=true) to enable your Fabric trial license.
>- To complete the exercises in this lab, you'll need two users. Your account can be one of the users. If you don't have  permission to create the second user, you can still complete the exercise but you won't be able review what a user sees when their access to specific functionality is granted or restricted.

## **How to create a second user for this exercise** 
**If you're part of an organization that has an Entra or Microsoft 365 tenant:** 

Work with your identity administrator to create the second user either in [**Entra**](https://entra.microsoft.com?azure-portal=true) or the [**Microsoft 365 admin center**](https://admin.cloud.microsoft?azure-portal=true).  

**If you're *not* a member of an organization with an Entra or Microsoft 365 tenant:**
1. You're unable to sign up for a Fabric trial with your personal email address. You can sign up for a [**Microsoft 365 trial**](/power-bi/enterprise/service-admin-signing-up-for-power-bi-with-a-new-office-365-trial?azure-portal=true) and a new organizational tenant will be created and you will become the User and Billing administrator of the tenant and can then create users.
2. Create the second user in the [**Microsoft 365 admin center**](https://admin.cloud.microsoft/#/users?azure-portal=true) See: [**Add users**](/microsoft-365/admin/add-users/add-users?azure-portal=true)
3. Enable the Fabric trial using [**Getting started with Fabric**](/fabric/get-started/fabric-trial?azure-portal=true).

Launch the exercise and follow the instructions.
