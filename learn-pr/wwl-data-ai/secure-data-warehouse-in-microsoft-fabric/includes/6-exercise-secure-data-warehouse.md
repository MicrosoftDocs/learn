Now it's your chance to secure a warehouse in Microsoft Fabric.

In this exercise, youâ€™ll learn how to secure a warehouse using the concepts explored in this module.

> [!NOTE]
> - You need a Microsoft Fabric trial license with the Fabric preview enabled in your tenant. See [**Getting started with Fabric**](/fabric/get-started/fabric-trial?azure-portal=true) to enable your Fabric trial license.
> - To complete the exercises in this lab, you'll need two user identities. If you're unable to create a second user, you can still complete the exercise using your user account, but you won't be able to experiment with what a less privileged user sees when they're granted or restricted access to specific functionality.

## **How to create a second user for this exercise** 
**If you're part of an organization that has an Entra or Microsoft 365 tenant:** 

Work with your identity administrator to create the second user either in [**Entra**](https://entra.microsoft.com?azure-portal=true) or the [**Microsoft 365 admin center**](https://admin.cloud.microsoft?azure-portal=true).  

**If you're *not* a member of an organization with an Entra or Microsoft 365 tenant:**
1. You're unable to sign up for a Fabric trial with your personal email address. You can sign up for a [**Microsoft 365 trial**](/power-bi/enterprise/service-admin-signing-up-for-power-bi-with-a-new-office-365-trial?azure-portal=true) and a new organizational tenant will be created and you'll become the User and Billing administrator of the tenant and can then create users.
2. Create the second user in the [**Microsoft 365 admin center**](https://admin.cloud.microsoft/#/users?azure-portal=true) See: [**Add users**](/microsoft-365/admin/add-users/add-users?azure-portal=true)
3. Enable the Fabric trial using [**Getting started with Fabric**](/fabric/get-started/fabric-trial?azure-portal=true).

Launch the exercise and follow the instructions.
