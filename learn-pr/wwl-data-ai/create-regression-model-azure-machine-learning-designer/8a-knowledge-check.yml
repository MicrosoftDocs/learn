  questions:
  - content: "You are creating a training pipeline for a regression model, using a dataset that has multiple numeric columns in which the values are on different scales. You want to transform the numeric columns so that the values are all on a similar scale based relative to the minimum and maximum values in each column. Which module should you add to the pipeline?"
    choices:
    - content: "Select Columns in a Dataset"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That is incorrect. When you need to transform numeric data to be on a similar scale, use a Normalize Data module."
    - content: "Normalize Data"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That is correct. When you need to transform numeric data to be on a similar scale, use a Normalize Data module."
    - content: "Clean Missing Data"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That is incorrect. When you need to transform numeric data to be on a similar scale, use a Normalize Data module."
  - content: "Why do we split our data into training and validation sets?"
    choices:
    - content: "Data is split into two sets in order to create two models, one model using the training set and a different model using the validation set."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That is incorrect. The validation set is used to test the  model created using the training set."
    - content: "Splitting data into two sets enables you to compare the labels that the model predicts with the actual known labels in the original dataset."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That is correct. We want to test the model created with training data on validation data to see how well the model performs with data it was not trained on."
    - content: "We only need to split our data when we use the Azure Machine Learning Designer, not in other machine learning scenarios."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That is incorrect. Splitting data into training and validation sets is an important part of all machine learning scenarios."
