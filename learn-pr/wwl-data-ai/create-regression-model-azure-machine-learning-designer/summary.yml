  title: "Knowledge check"
  questions:
  - content: "You plan to use Azure Machine Learning designer to create and publish a regression model. Which edition should you choose when creating an Azure Machine Learning workspace?"
    choices:
    - content: "Basic"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That is incorrect. The designer interface is only available in Enterprise edition."
    - content: "Enterprise"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That is correct. The designer interface is only available in Enterprise edition."
    - content: "Either"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That is incorrect. The designer interface is only available in Enterprise edition."
  - content: "You are creating a training pipeline for a regression model, using a dataset that has multiple numeric columns in which the values are on different scales. You want to transform the numeric columns so that the values are all on a similar scale based relative to the minimum and maximum values in each column. Which module should you add to the pipeline?"
    choices:
    - content: "Select Columns in a Dataset"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That is incorrect. When you need to transform numeric data to be on a similar scale, use a Normalize Data module."
    - content: "Normalize Data"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That is correct. When you need to transform numeric data to be on a similar scale, use a Normalize Data module."
    - content: "Clean Missing Data"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That is incorrect. When you need to transform numeric data to be on a similar scale, use a Normalize Data module."
  - content: "You use Azure Machine Learning designer to create a training pipeline and an inference pipeline for a regression model. Now you plan to deploy the inference pipeline as a real-time service. What kind of compute target should you create to host the service?"
    choices:
    - content: "Compute Instance"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That is incorrect. Use an Inference Cluster for deployment."
    - content: "Compute Cluster"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That is incorrect. Use an Inference Cluster for deployment."
    - content: "Inference Cluster"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That is correct. Use an Inference Cluster for deployment."
