  questions:
  - content: "In Azure Machine Learning studio, what can you use to author regression machine learning pipelines using a drag-and-drop interface?"
    choices:
    - content: "Notebooks"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. You can use Notebooks to author machine learning projects with code."
    - content: "Automated machine learning"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. You can use AutoML to author regression pipelines with a click-through wizard."
    - content: "Designer"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. You can use Designer to author regression pipelines with a drag-and-drop interface."
  - content: "You are creating a training pipeline for a regression model. You use a dataset that has multiple numeric columns in which the values are on different scales. You want to transform the numeric columns so that the values are all on a similar scale. You also want the transformation to scale relative to the minimum and maximum values in each column. Which module should you add to the pipeline?"
    choices:
    - content: "Select Columns in a Dataset"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. When you transform numeric data to be on a similar scale, use a Normalize Data module."
    - content: "Clean Missing Data"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. When you transform numeric data to be on a similar scale, use a Normalize Data module."
    - content: "Normalize Data"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. When you transform numeric data to be on a similar scale, use a Normalize Data module."
  - content: "Why do you split data into training and validation sets?"
    choices:
    - content: "Data is split into two sets in order to create two models, one model with the training set and a different model with the validation set."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The validation set is used to test the model created with the training set."
    - content: "Splitting data into two sets enables you to train the model with the training set and test the model on unseen data from the test set."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. When you test the model with unseen data from the test set, you can compare the model's predicted labels against the test set's labels."
    - content: "Only split data when you use the Azure Machine Learning Designer, not in other machine learning scenarios."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Splitting data into training and validation sets is an important part of all machine learning scenarios."
