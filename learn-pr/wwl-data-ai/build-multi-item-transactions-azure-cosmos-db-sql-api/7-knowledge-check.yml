  questions:
  - content: "At the end of your stored procedure, you would like to set the HTTP response to a static string of **Test**. Which line of JavaScript code should you use to accomplish this task?"
    choices:
    - content: "``context.getResponse().setBody('Test');``"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. The HTTP response object includes a setBody function used to set the body of the HTTP response."
    - content: "``context.setBody('Test');``"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The context object doesn't include a setBody function."
    - content: "``context.getCollection().setBody('Test');``"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The collection object doesn't include a setBody function."
  - content: "You're authoring a stored procedure in JavaScript and would like to manually roll back a transaction in your code for a certain condition. Which line of code should you use to roll back a transaction?"
    choices:
    - content: "``getContext().rollback();``"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The context object doesn't include a rollback function."
    - content: "``throw new Error();``"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Throwing an exception will roll back the entire transaction."
    - content: "``return;``"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Returning from the function will commit the entire transaction."
  - content: "Your code contains a variable of type **Microsoft.Azure.Cosmos.Container** named **container** and another variable of type **Microsoft.Azure.Cosmos.Scripts.StoredProcedureProperties** named **props**. Which code block below would asynchronously create a new stored procedure using the two variables?"
    choices:
    - content: "``await container.StoredProcedures.CreateStoredProcedureAsync(props);``"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The **Container** class doesn't include a property named **StoredProcedures**."
    - content: "``await container.CreateStoredProcedureAsync(props);``"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The **Container** class doesn't have a method named **CreateStoredProcedureAsync**."
    - content: "``await container.Scripts.CreateStoredProcedureAsync(props);``"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. The **Scripts** property of the **Container** class includes a method named **CreateStoredProcedureAsync**."
  - content: "Your stored procedure creates three items with three distinct unique identifiers and logical partition key values. When running your stored procedure, you encounter an error. What is the cause for this error?"
    choices:
    - content: "Stored procedures are scoped to only a single item"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. A stored procedure can perform a transaction with multiple items."
    - content: "Stored procedures are scoped to only a single logical partition"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "This's correct. You can't execute a stored procedure that performs operations across logical partition key values."
    - content: "Stored procedures are scoped to only a single unique identifier"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. A stored procedure can perform a transaction with multiple items, each with a distinct unique identifier."
