title: Detect, analyze, and recognize faces
summary: The ability for applications to detect human faces, analyze facial features and emotions, and identify individuals is a key artificial intelligence capability.
abstract: |
  After completing this module, you will be able to:
  - Identify options for face detection, analysis, and identification
  - Understand considerations for face analysis
  - Detect faces with the Computer Vision service
  - Understand capabilities of the Face service
  - Compare and match detected faces
  - Implement facial recognition
prerequisites: |
  Before starting this module, you should already have:
  - Familiarity with Azure and the Azure portal.
  - Experience programming with C# or Python.
  If you have no previous programming experience, we recommend you complete the [Take your first steps with C#](/training/paths/csharp-first-steps/) or [Take your first steps with Python](/training/paths/python-first-steps/) learning path first.
