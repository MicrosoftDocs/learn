title: Detect, analyze, and recognize faces
summary: The ability for applications to detect human faces, analyze facial features and emotions, and identify individuals is a key artificial intelligence capability.
abstract: |
  After completing this module, you'll be able to:

  - Identify options for face detection, analysis, and identification.

  - Understand considerations for face analysis.

  - Detect faces with the Computer Vision service.

  - Understand capabilities of the Face service.

  - Compare and match detected faces.

  - Implement facial recognition.
prerequisites: |
  Before starting this module, you should already have:

  - Familiarity with Azure and the Azure portal.

  - Experience programming with C# or Python.

  If you have no previous programming experience, we recommend you complete the [Take your first steps with C#](/training/paths/csharp-first-steps/) or [Take your first steps with Python](/training/paths/python-first-steps/) learning path first.
