While all applications of artificial intelligence require considerations for responsible, system that rely on facial or other biometric data can be particularly problematic.

When building a solution that uses facial data, considerations include (but aren't limited to):

- **Data privacy and security**. Facial data is personally identifiable, and should be considered sensitive and private. You should ensure that you have implemented adequate protection for facial data used for model training and inferencing.
- **Transparency**. Ensure that users are informed about how their facial data is used, and who will have access to it.
- **Fairness and inclusiveness**. Ensure that your face-based system can't be used in a manner that is prejudicial to individuals based on their appearance, or to unfairly target individuals.
