  questions:
  - content: "Which statement best describes AgentGroupChat in the Semantic Kernel AgentChat framework?"  
    choices:  
      - content: "It only supports interactions between agents of the same type."  
        isCorrect: false  
        explanation: "Incorrect. AgentGroupChat allows agents of different types, such as ChatCompletionAgent and OpenAIAssistantAgent, to work together."  
      - content: "It is an abstract class that must be subclassed to enable multi-agent interactions."  
        isCorrect: false  
        explanation: "Incorrect. AgentGroupChat is a concrete implementation of AgentChat, not an abstract class."  
      - content: "It enables interaction between multiple agents and uses strategy-based approaches to manage conversation dynamics."  
        isCorrect: true  
        explanation: "Correct. AgentGroupChat allows multiple agents to collaborate using strategy-based conversation management."  
  - content: "In an agent group chat, how does the Semantic Kernel Agent Framework select the right agent for a task?" 
    choices:  
      - content: "By random selection" 
        isCorrect: false 
        explanation: "Incorrect. Agent selection isn't random; it's based on analyzing user intent and routing according to specific rules."
      - content: "Using the specified selection strategy" 
        isCorrect: true 
        explanation: "Correct. The framework uses the defined selection strategy to determin which agent should respond."
      - content: "By the agent's physical location" 
        isCorrect: false 
        explanation: "Incorrect. Agent selection isn't based on physical location but on task relevance and expertise."
  - content: "What is the role of the Termination Strategy in the Semantic Kernel Agent Framework?" 
    choices:
      - content: "It determines when a conversation or task should end" 
        isCorrect: true 
        explanation: "Correct. The Termination Strategy ensures conversations or tasks are properly concluded, preventing unnecessary messages or prolonged interactions."
      - content: "It defines the flow of conversation" 
        isCorrect: false 
        explanation: "Incorrect. The flow of conversation is managed by the selection strategy, not the termination strategy."
      - content: "It decides which agent takes the next turn" 
        isCorrect: false 
        explanation: "Incorrect. The next agent to respond is determined by the selection strategy, not the termination strategy."
