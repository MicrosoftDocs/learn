  questions:
  - content: "What's the first step in the Semantic Kernel SDK's unified orchestration workflow?"  
    choices:  
    - content: "Select and create an orchestration pattern"  
      isCorrect: false  
      explanation: "Incorrect. Selecting and creating an orchestration comes after defining the agents."  
    - content: "Define your agents and describe their capabilities"  
      isCorrect: true  
      explanation: "Correct. The workflow begins by defining each agent and specifying what it can do."  
    - content: "Start a runtime to manage execution"  
      isCorrect: false  
      explanation: "Incorrect. Starting a runtime happens later in the workflow, after defining agents and orchestration."
  - content: "For brainstorming and collaborative problem solving among multiple agents, which orchestration pattern is most suitable?"  
    choices:  
    - content: "Group Chat"  
      isCorrect: true  
      explanation: "Correct. Group Chat coordinates multiple agents in a shared conversation for collaboration and consensus."  
    - content: "Magentic"  
      isCorrect: false  
      explanation: "Incorrect. Magentic is for complex multi-agent problem solving across domains, not focused specifically on collaborative brainstorming."  
    - content: "Sequential"  
      isCorrect: false  
      explanation: "Incorrect. Sequential is for stepwise processing, not collaborative discussion."  
  - content: "Which pattern dynamically transfers control between agents based on context or rules?"  
    choices:  
    - content: "Handoff"  
      isCorrect: true  
      explanation: "Correct. Handoff allows tasks to move between agents depending on context, rules, or expertise."  
    - content: "Concurrent"  
      isCorrect: false  
      explanation: "Incorrect. Concurrent runs tasks independently in parallel, not dynamically based on context."  
    - content: "Sequential"  
      isCorrect: false  
      explanation: "Incorrect. Sequential follows a fixed order and does not dynamically change control between agents."
