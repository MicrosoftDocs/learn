The Semantic Kernel SDK's agent orchestration framework makes it possible to design, manage, and scale complex multi-agent workflows without having to manually handle the details of agent coordination. Instead of relying on a single agent to manage every aspect of a task, you can combine multiple specialized agents. Each agent with a unique role or area of expertise can collaborate to create systems that are more robust, adaptive, and capable of solving real-world problems collaboratively.

By orchestrating agents together, you can take on tasks that would be too complex for a single agent—from running parallel analyses, to building multi-stage processing pipelines, to managing dynamic, context-driven handoffs between experts.

## Why multi-agent orchestration matters

Single-agent systems are often limited in scope, constrained by one set of instructions or a single model prompt. Multi-agent orchestration addresses this limitation by allowing you to:

- Assign distinct skills, responsibilities, or perspectives to each agent.
- Combine outputs from multiple agents to improve decision-making and accuracy.
- Coordinate steps in a workflow so each agent’s work builds on the last.
- Dynamically route control between agents based on context or rules.

This approach opens the door to more flexible, efficient, and scalable solutions, especially for real-world applications that require collaboration, specialization, or redundancy.

## Supported orchestration patterns

Semantic Kernel provides several orchestration patterns directly in the SDK, each offering a different approach to coordinating agents. These patterns are designed to be technology-agnostic so you can adapt them to your own domain and integrate them into your existing systems.

- **Concurrent orchestration** - Broadcast the same task to multiple agents at once and collect their results independently. Useful for parallel analysis, independent subtasks, or ensemble decision making.
- **Sequential orchestration** - Pass the output from one agent to the next in a fixed order. Ideal for step-by-step workflows, pipelines, and progressive refinement.
- **Handoff orchestration** - Dynamically transfer control between agents based on context or rules. Great for escalation, fallback, and expert routing where one agent works at a time.
- **Group chat orchestration** - Coordinate a shared conversation among multiple agents (and optionally a human), managed by a chat manager that chooses who speaks next. Best for brainstorming, collaborative problem solving, and building consensus.
- **Magentic orchestration** - A manager-driven approach that plans, delegates, and adapts across specialized agents. Suited to complex, open-ended problems where the solution path evolves.

## A unified orchestration workflow

Regardless of which orchestration pattern you choose, the Semantic Kernel SDK provides a consistent, developer-friendly interface for building and running them. The typical flow looks like this:

1. **Define your agents** and describe their capabilities.
1. **Select and create an orchestration** pattern, optionally adding a manager agent if needed.
1. **Optionally configure callbacks or transforms** for custom input and output handling.
1. **Start a runtime** to manage execution.
1. **Invoke the orchestration** with your task.
1. **Retrieve results** in an asynchronous, non-blocking way.

Because all patterns share the same core interface, you can easily experiment with different orchestration strategies without rewriting agent logic or learning new APIs. The SDK abstracts the complexity of agent communication, coordination, and result aggregation so you can focus on designing workflows that deliver results.

Multi-agent orchestration in the Semantic Kernel SDK provides a flexible, scalable way to build intelligent systems that combine the strengths of multiple specialized agents. With built-in orchestration patterns, a unified development model, and runtime features for managing execution, you can quickly prototype, refine, and deploy collaborative AI workflows. Whether you’re running agents in parallel, coordinating sequential steps, or enabling dynamic conversations, the framework gives you the tools to turn multiple agents into a cohesive problem-solving team.
