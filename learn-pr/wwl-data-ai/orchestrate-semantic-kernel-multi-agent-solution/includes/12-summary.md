In this module, you explored how to design and manage multi-agent orchestration workflows using the Semantic Kernel SDK. You learned how multi-agent systems provide advantages over single-agent approaches, including improved scalability, specialization, and collaborative problem solving. You also learned several different orchestration patterns—concurrent, sequential, handoff, group chat, and magentic—and reviewed guidance on when and how to use each. You also saw how the SDK provides a unified interface for defining agents, running orchestrations, handling structured data, and retrieving results asynchronously, enabling you to build flexible, reliable, and maintainable multi-agent workflows.
