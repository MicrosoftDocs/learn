**Azure AI services** are cloud-based services that encapsulate AI capabilities. Rather than a single product, you should think of AI services as a set of individual services that you can use as building blocks to compose sophisticated, intelligent applications.

AI services includes a wide range of individual services across language, speech, vision, generative AI, and more. You can use AI services to build your own AI solutions to provide out-of-the-box solutions for common AI scenarios. A few examples of individual Azure AI services include:

- **Azure AI Vision** - Analyze content in images and videos.
- **Azure AI Language** - Build apps with industry-leading natural language understanding capabilities.
- **Azure AI Speech** - Speech to text, text to speech, translation, and speaker recognition.
- **Azure AI Document Intelligence** - An optical character recognition (OCR) solution that can extract semantic meaning from forms, such as invoices, receipts, and others.
- **Azure AI Search** - A cloud-scale search solution that uses AI services to extract insights from data and documents.
- **Azure AI Foundry** - An Azure AI service that provides access to generative AI models and agents.

While the details of each AI service can vary, the approach to provisioning and consuming them is generally the same.

In this module, you will learn how to:

- Create Azure AI services resources in an Azure subscription.
- Identify endpoints, keys, and locations required to consume an AI services resource.
- Use a REST API to consume an AI service.
- Use an SDK to consume an AI service.
