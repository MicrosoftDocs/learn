**Azure AI services** are cloud-based services that encapsulate AI capabilities. Rather than a single product, you should think of AI services as a set of individual services that you can use as building blocks to compose sophisticated, intelligent applications.

AI services includes a wide range of individual services across language, speech, vision, generative AI, and more. You can use AI services to build your own AI solutions to provide out-of-the-box solutions for common AI scenarios. A few examples of individual Azure AI services include:

- **Azure AI Vision** - Analyze content in images and videos.
- **Azure AI Language** - Build apps with industry-leading natural language understanding capabilities.
- **Azure AI Speech** - Speech to text, text to speech, translation, and speaker recognition.
- **Azure AI Document Intelligence** - An optical character recognition (OCR) solution that can extract semantic meaning from forms, such as invoices, receipts, and others.
- **Azure AI Search** - A cloud-scale search solution that uses AI services to extract insights from data and documents.
- **Azure OpenAI** - An Azure AI service that provides access to the capabilities of OpenAI GPT-4.

While the details of each AI service can vary, the approach to provisioning and consuming them is generally the same.

In this module, you will learn how to:

- Create Azure AI services resources in an Azure subscription.
- Identify endpoints, keys, and locations required to consume an AI services resource.
- Use a REST API to consume an AI service.
- Use an SDK to consume an AI service.
