A common pattern for "intelligent" applications is to enable users to ask questions using natural language, and receive appropriate answers. In effect, this kind of solution brings conversational intelligence to a traditional frequently asked questions (FAQ) publication. In this module, you will learn how to use Azure AI Language to create a knowledge base of question and answer pairs that can support an application or bot.

After completing this module, you’ll be able to:

- Understand question answering and how it compares to language understanding.
- Create, test, publish and consume a knowledge base.
- Implement multi-turn conversation and active learning.
- Create a question answering bot to interact with using natural language.
