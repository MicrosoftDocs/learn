In this module, you explored how to enrich applications with Azure AI Services integrated into Azure Database for PostgreSQL. You learned to summarize text, analyze sentiment, extract key phrases and entities, protect sensitive information, and translate content for global accessibility.

By implementing these features, you can transform unstructured data into structured insights, improve user experiences, and support compliance requirements. The ability to process and analyze data directly within the database streamlines workflows and enables smarter, more responsive applications.

**After completing this module, you are now able to:**

- Summarize property descriptions and reviews for concise presentation.
- Analyze guest sentiment and identify areas for improvement.
- Extract and categorize key information from text data.
- Safeguard privacy by detecting and redacting Personal Identifiable Information (PII).
