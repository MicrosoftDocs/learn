Modern applications increasingly depend on intelligent data processing to deliver meaningful insights and enhance user experiences. Whether it’s summarizing lengthy descriptions, analyzing reviews for sentiment, or extracting key details from unstructured text, organizations need scalable solutions that work directly within their data platforms.

Imagine a vacation rental company managing thousands of listings and reviews. The team faces challenges in surfacing the most relevant information, protecting sensitive data, and supporting a diverse, global audience. By using Azure AI Services with Azure Database for PostgreSQL, these tasks become streamlined and efficient. The integration enables automated summarization, sentiment analysis, key phrase extraction, entity recognition, Personal Identifiable Information (PII) protection, and translation—all within the database environment.

This module guides you through implementing these intelligent features, showing how to enrich applications with actionable insights and multilingual support, while keeping data secure and accessible.
