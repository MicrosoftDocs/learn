In this exercise, you use Azure Container Registry (ACR) Tasks to build and manage container images entirely in the cloud, without requiring a local Docker installation.

Tasks performed in this exercise:

- Download the project starter files
- Deploy Azure Container Registry
- Build and verify container images using ACR Tasks
- Manage image versions and protect production images

This exercise takes approximately **30** minutes to complete.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Azure Container Registry task runs are temporarily paused from Azure free credits. This exercise requires a pay-as-you-go, or another paid plan.
