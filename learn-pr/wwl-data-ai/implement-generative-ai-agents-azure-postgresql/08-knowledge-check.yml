  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: What are the two core capabilities that Azure Database for PostgreSQL provides for agentic architectures?
    choices:
    - content: Data encryption and backup
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. While important for database management, these features aren't the core capabilities for agentic architectures.
    - content: Information retrieval and agent memory
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. PostgreSQL supports both information retrieval through pgvector and agent memory for maintaining context across workflows.
    - content: User authentication and authorization
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. These options are security features, not the primary capabilities for supporting AI agents.
  - content: Which framework is specifically designed for complex workflows and multi-agent coordination with branching logic?
    choices:
    - content: LangGraph
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. LangGraph is designed for multi-agent workflows with branching logic and memory.
    - content: Semantic Kernel
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. Semantic Kernel emphasizes modularity and enterprise tool integration, not specifically multi-agent workflows.
    - content: Autogen
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. While Autogen supports agent collaboration, LangGraph is specifically designed for complex workflow orchestration.
  - content: In an agentic architecture, where does Model Context Protocol (MCP) fit?
    choices:
    - content: The architecture fits between the user interface and the database.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. MCP operates at a different layer in the architecture.
    - content: The architecture fits between the database and storage systems.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. MCP isn't focused on data layer integration.
    - content: The architecture fits between the orchestration layer and the tool layer.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. MCP sits between orchestration frameworks and tools, enabling agents to dynamically access external capabilities.
