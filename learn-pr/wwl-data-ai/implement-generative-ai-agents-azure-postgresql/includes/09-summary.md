In this module, you explored how to implement AI agents using Azure Database for PostgreSQL. You learned about agentic architectures, information retrieval with vector search, multi-agent orchestration frameworks, and integration with Foundry Agent Service and Model Context Protocol.

By combining these capabilities, you can build intelligent systems that understand context, retrieve relevant information, and coordinate complex workflows. Azure Database for PostgreSQL provides the foundation for agent memory, semantic search, and scalable data access, enabling you to create responsive, personalized applications.

**After completing this module, you can:**

- Build agentic architectures using PostgreSQL for information retrieval and memory.
- Implement vector search and semantic operators for context-aware responses.
- Compare and select agentic frameworks like Semantic Kernel, LangGraph, LlamaIndex, and Foundry Agent Service.
- Deploy AI agents with Foundry Agent Service integrated with PostgreSQL.
- Extend agent capabilities using Model Context Protocol (MCP) for standardized tool access.
