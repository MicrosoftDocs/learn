Generative AI can help with all sorts of content creation projects. In this module, learn how to use generative AI to create a story about an imaginary destination from your dreams. Bring your own interests to this endeavor as you reference a place you know well but work to reimagine with a twist. How can you make it unique and exciting? How might it reflect your own interests or passions? 

You co-create this vision with AI. Use Copilot in your browser to research, ideate, write copy, and create visuals to bring your idea to life. Each exercise in this module focuses on a different part of the experience and provides a sample prompt you can copy and edit. The structure of the steps and the prompts are created to highlight specific techniques or functionality. Sample responses are provided to show you examples of the content Copilot creates.
