In this module, you learned how Azure Container Apps environments act as a boundary for networking and observability in an AI solution. You deployed a container app using Azure CLI and then used YAML as a source-controlled configuration approach for repeatable deployments. You configured runtime settings using environment variables and secrets so sensitive values stay out of container images and source control. You also configured private registry authentication and validated deployments by inspecting logs, revisions, and replica state. Finally, you practiced an end-to-end workflow by deploying a containerized backend API.
