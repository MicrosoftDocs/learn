  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "What are key considerations when integrating Azure OpenAI Service into applications?"
    choices:
      - content: "User interface design"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect. While important, the integration involves more than just UI design, focusing on secure and ethical AI use."
      - content: "Security features and ethical AI usage"
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "Correct. When integrating Azure OpenAI, it's crucial to consider security and ethical implications of AI use."
      - content: "Replacing all existing systems with AI"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect. Integration typically supplements rather than replaces existing systems."
  - content: "How does Retrieval Augmentation Generation (RAG) enhance language model responses?"
    choices:
      - content: "By reducing the computational resources needed"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect. RAG primarily enhances responses by using extra data sources for more accurate and relevant answers, not by reducing resource usage."
      - content: "By providing grounding data from vector databases"
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "Correct. RAG systems use an information retrieval component to provide grounding data from vector databases, enhancing the relevance and accuracy of responses."
      - content: "By translating responses into multiple languages automatically"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect. RAG's main enhancement isn't translation but improving the responses making them more contextual and relevant."
  - content: "How do you generate embeddings for use in vCore-based Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB?"
    choices:
      - content: "By manually encoding data points"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect. Embeddings are typically generated using machine learning models, not manually."
      - content: "Using Azure OpenAI's API to create numerical embeddings"
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "Correct. Azure OpenAI's API is used to generate numerical embeddings from text, which can then be stored in vector columns for vector search."
      - content: "By direct input from database administrators"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect. While database administrators configure the system, embeddings generate automatically by machine learning algorithms, not by administrators."
