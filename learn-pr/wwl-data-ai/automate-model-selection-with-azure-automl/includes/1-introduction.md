*Automated Machine Learning* enables you to try multiple algorithms and preprocessing transformations with your data. This, combined with scalable cloud-based compute makes it possible to find the best performing model for your data without the huge amount of time-consuming manual trial and error that would otherwise be required.

Azure Machine Learning includes support for automated machine learning through a visual interface in Azure Machine Learning studio. You can use the Azure Machine Learning SDK to run automated machine learning experiments.

## Learning objectives 

In this module, you will learn how to:

- Use Azure Machine Learning's automated machine learning capabilities to determine the best performing algorithm for your data.
- Use automated machine learning to preprocess data for training.
- Run an automated machine learning experiment.
