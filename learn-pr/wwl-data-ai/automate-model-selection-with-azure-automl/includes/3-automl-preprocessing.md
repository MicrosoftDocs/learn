As well as trying a selection of algorithms, automated machine learning can apply preprocessing transformations to your data; improving the performance of the model.

## Scaling and normalization

Automated machine learning applies scaling and normalization to numeric data automatically, helping prevent any large-scale features from dominating training. During an automated machine learning experiment, multiple scaling or normalization techniques will be applied.

## Optional featurization

You can choose to have automated machine learning apply preprocessing transformations, such as:

* Missing value imputation to eliminate nulls in the training dataset.
* Categorical encoding to convert categorical features to numeric indicators.
* Dropping high-cardinality features, such as record IDs.
* Feature engineering (for example, deriving individual date parts from DateTime features)
* Others...
