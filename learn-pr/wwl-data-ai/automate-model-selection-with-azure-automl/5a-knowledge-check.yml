  questions:
  - content: "You are using automated machine learning to train a model that predicts the species of a penguin based on its bill and flipper measurements. Which kind of task should you specify for automated machine learning?"
    choices:
    - content: "Regression"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This is incorrect. Predicting a class requires a classification task."
    - content: "Forecasting"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This is incorrect. Predicting a class requires a classification task."
    - content: "Classification"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "This is correct. Predicting a class requires a classification task."
  - content: "You want to use automated machine learning to find the model with the best AUC_weighted metric. Which parameter of the AutoMLConfig object should you set?"
    choices:
    - content: "task='AUC_weighted'"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That is incorrect. Set the primary metric to the performance score for which you want to optimize the model."
    - content: "label_column_name= 'AUC_weighted'"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That is incorrect. Set the primary metric to the performance score for which you want to optimize the model."
    - content: "primary_metric='AUC_weighted'"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That is correct. Set the primary metric to the performance score for which you want to optimize the model."
