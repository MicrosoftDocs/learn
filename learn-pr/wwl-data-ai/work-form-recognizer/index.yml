title: Extract data from forms with Form Recognizer
summary: Form Recognizer uses machine learning technology to identify and extract key-value pairs and table data from form documents with accuracy, at scale. This module teaches you how to use the *Azure Form Recognizer* cognitive service.
abstract: |
  In this module, you'll learn how to:
  - Identify how Form Recognizer's layout service, prebuilt models, and custom service can automate processes
  - Use Form Recognizer's Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capabilities with SDKs, REST API, and Form OCR Test Tool (FOTT)
  - Develop and test custom models using supervised and unsupervised training
prerequisites: |
  To complete this module, you will need:
  - An active Azure account
  - Knowledge of Azure portal navigation
  - Knowledge of at least one programming language (C#, Python)
