quiz:
  questions:
  - content: "A person plans to use a Form Recognizer prebuilt invoice model. To extract form data using the model, what are two calls they need to make to the REST API?"
    choices:
    - content: "Train Model and Get Model Labels"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect: They do not need to train a prebuilt model."
    - content: "Analyze Invoice and Get Analyze Invoice Result"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct: The Analyze Invoice function starts the form analysis and returns a result ID, which they can pass in a subsequent call to the Get Analyze Invoice Result function to retrieve the results."
    - content: "Create Form Recognizer and Get Analyze Invoice Result"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect: While they do need to create a Form Recognizer or Cognitive Service resource to use Form Recognizer services, Create Form Recognizer is not one of the REST API calls used to extract data."
  - content: "A person needs to build an application that submits expense claims and extracts the merchant, date, and total from scanned receipts. What's the **best** way to do this?"
    choices:
    - content: "Use the Read API of the Computer Vision service."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect: The Read API of the Computer Vision service can read text from an image, but they'll want to use Form Recognizer to extract key-value pairs."
    - content: "Use Form Recognizer's prebuilt receipts model"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct: Use the Form Recognizer's prebuilt receipts model. It can intelligently extract the required fields even if the scanned receipts have different names in them."
    - content: "Use Form Recognizer's Layout service"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect: The Layout service will extract the structured output from documents, but the best way to build this application is to use a model specific to receipts."
  - content: "A person is building a custom model with Form Recognizer services. What is a difference between their supervised and unsupervised training processes?"
    choices:
    - content: "Unsupervised training requires form images while supervised training requires form images and additional **.json** files."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct: The labels needed in supervised training refer to the the **ocr.json** files, **labels.json** files, and single **fields.json** file."
    - content: "When they store training forms in an Azure storage container, they need to generate a SAS URL for the container for unsupervised training but **not** for supervised training."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect: When they store training forms in an Azure storage container, both training processes require a SAS URL."
    - content: "Unsupervised training produces a model ID while supervised training produces labeled JSON files."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect: Both unsupervised and supervised training processes produce Model IDs. The Model ID is needed to analyze new forms."
