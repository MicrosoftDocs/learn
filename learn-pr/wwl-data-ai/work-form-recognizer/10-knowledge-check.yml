quiz:
  questions:
  - content: "A person plans to use an Azure Document Intelligence prebuilt invoice model. To extract form data using the model, what are two calls they need to make to the REST API?"
    choices:
    - content: "Train Model and Get Model Labels"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect: They do not need to train a prebuilt model."
    - content: "Analyze Invoice and Get Analyze Invoice Result"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct: The Analyze Invoice function starts the form analysis and returns a result ID, which they can pass in a subsequent call to the Get Analyze Invoice Result function to retrieve the results."
    - content: "Create Azure Document Intelligence and Get Analyze Invoice Result"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect: While they do need to create an Azure Document Intelligence or Azure AI Service resource to use Azure Document Intelligence services, Create Azure Document Intelligence is not one of the REST API calls used to extract data."
  - content: "A person needs to build an application that submits expense claims and extracts the merchant, date, and total from scanned receipts. What's the **best** way to do this?"
    choices:
    - content: "Use the Read API of the Computer Vision service."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect: The Read API of the Computer Vision service can read text from an image, but they'll want to use Azure Document Intelligence to extract key-value pairs."
    - content: "Use Azure Document Intelligence's prebuilt receipts model"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct: Use the Azure Document Intelligence's prebuilt receipts model. It can intelligently extract the required fields even if the scanned receipts have different names in them."
    - content: "Use Azure Document Intelligence's Layout service"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect: The Layout service will extract the structured output from documents, but the best way to build this application is to use a model specific to receipts."
  - content: "A person is building a custom model with Azure Document Intelligence services. What is required to train a model?"
    choices:
    - content: "Along with the form to analyze, JSON files need to be provided."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct: The labels needed in training are referenced in the **ocr.json** files, **labels.json** files, and single **fields.json** file."
    - content: "Training must be done through language specific SDKs."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect: Labeled training can be done through SDKs, REST API, or Azure Document Intelligence Studio."
    - content: "Nothing else is required."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect: Labeled training requires JSON files to be provided when training a model, or those JSON files need to generated before training your model."
