In today’s digital landscape, organizations are turning to cloud and AI platforms to accelerate innovation, improve operational efficiency, and deliver transformative customer experiences. Microsoft’s Cloud & AI Platforms are built on secure, scalable, and intelligent infrastructure—supporting everything from data integration and governance to machine learning and generative AI.

## Introduction to Azure

Microsoft Azure is your intelligent cloud—designed to help every organization innovate securely, scale efficiently, and build responsibly. Azure offers a comprehensive suite of services spanning infrastructure, data, AI, and developer tools, enabling businesses to create the future together.

Azure helps organizations outpace competition, build securely, and deliver differentiated experiences. With built-in security, compliance, and governance, Azure supports mission-critical workloads and AI innovation across industries.

> [!TIP]
> Azure integrates seamlessly with Microsoft 365, GitHub, and Power Platform to deliver end-to-end solutions for developers, data professionals, and business leaders.

> [!NOTE]
> Azure supports open-source frameworks like PyTorch and TensorFlow, and integrates with GitHub Copilot and Visual Studio for streamlined development.

## Unify your data platform

A unified data estate is essential for AI-driven insights and decision-making. Microsoft Azure simplifies data management, ensures compliance, and accelerates analytics with integrated solutions like:

- **Microsoft Fabric**. A unified SaaS platform for data analytics, enabling ingestion, storage, and analysis in OneLake—a single, open data lake. Integrates with Power BI, Azure Synapse, and Data Factory for seamless experiences across data engineering and business intelligence.
- **Azure Databricks**. An open lakehouse architecture supporting structured and unstructured data, collaborative workflows, and built-in AI tools like Mosaic AI for model development and deployment.
- **Azure Databases**. Scalable, secure, and AI-optimized services (Azure SQL, PostgreSQL, Cosmos DB) with vector search and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) support.
- **Microsoft Purview**. Unified data governance with metadata discovery, lineage tracking, and compliance integration across Fabric and Databricks.

> [!TIP]
> Use Microsoft Fabric to create a unified data foundation that supports analytics, governance, and AI workloads.

> [!NOTE]
> A unified data platform reduces operational complexity and enhances data security and accessibility.

## Migrate and modernize your estate

Modernizing IT infrastructure unlocks agility and lays the foundation for AI innovation. Azure provides tools to migrate workloads securely and optimize performance across hybrid and multicloud environments:

- **Azure Migrate**: Centralized hub for assessing and migrating on-premises workloads to Azure.
- **Azure VMware Solution**: Seamless migration of VMware workloads without refactoring.
- **Azure Arc**: Extends Azure management and governance to on-premises, multicloud, and edge environments.
- **Azure Landing Zone**: Scalable foundation for cloud adoption with best practices for identity, security, and governance.
- **Azure Monitor**: Full-stack observability with metrics, logs, and alerts.
- **Microsoft Defender for Cloud**: Comprehensive security posture management and threat protection across Azure, Amazon web Services (AWS), and Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

> [!TIP]
> Start with a cloud migration assessment to identify workloads that benefit most from modernization.

## Innovate with Azure AI apps and agents

Building intelligent applications is central to digital transformation. Azure offers a rich set of AI services and developer tools to create custom solutions that enhance productivity and customer engagement:

- **Azure AI Studio**: Unified environment for building, testing, and deploying AI apps and agents.
- **Azure OpenAI Service**: Access to powerful language models like GPT and Codex for natural language understanding and generation.
- **GitHub Copilot**: AI-assisted coding to accelerate development and automate routine tasks.
- **Azure AI Search**: Intelligent search experiences with semantic ranking, vector search, and RAG capabilities.
- **Azure AI Document Intelligence**: Extract structured data from documents for automation and decision-making.

> [!TIP]
> Use GitHub Copilot to accelerate development and integrate AI into existing workflows.
