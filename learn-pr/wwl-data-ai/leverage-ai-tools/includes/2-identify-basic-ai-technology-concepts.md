Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the ability of a computer program or machine to **mimic human-like behavior**. For example, to mimic vision, speech recognition, decision-making, natural language understanding, and so on. It's not a technology in and of itself, but rather a goal set by technologists to imitate human intelligence.

## What is generative AI?
Generative AI is a **subset of AI**. AI is used to predict outcomes, detect entities, classify documents, and more. Generative AI, also known as GenAI, can create content such as images, videos, code, or text. The goal is for AI-generated content to be as useful as any created by humans.

For example, you can use generative AI to develop follow-up questions to a meeting, create an image from text, or explain the punch line of a joke--even if the joke is in a video.

>AI has great disruptive potential. That is why it should follow the highest ethical standards. **Responsible AI** refers to the **principles and best practices** that ensure AI work is accountable, inclusive, reliable, safe, fair, transparent, secure, and respects privacy. For instance, AI could create a video that shows a real person at an event they didn't attend in real life. Responsible AI involves not using this technology for deceitful purposes, since it would compromise their privacy and have unfair consequences.
