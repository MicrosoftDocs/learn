AI embedded in everyday applications may not be enough to power the business applications an organization needs. In these cases, **Power Platform** is the next step towards more customizable AI solutions. It provides a simple, low-code way to introduce AI in your business applications without having to create or manage the AI yourself.

## What is Microsoft Power Platform?

Microsoft Power Platform provides low-code and no-code services designed to simplify the process of building technical solutions. It provides building blocks that help teams work faster. Even if Power Platform isn't centered on AI, its services are often powered by AI and help you create smart solutions.

The Power Platform portfolio includes five different products: Power BI, Power Apps, Power Automate, Copilot Studio, and Power Pages. It also offers three additional tools: AI Builder, Microsoft Dataverse, and Connectors. Let's see what each of them can do for you.

## What can you do with Microsoft Power Platform?

All of the products contained in Power Platform are used to speed up business app development. Beside the specific AI functionality they include, they can be connected to Copilot. Thanks to this feature, users can leverage the Copilot generative AI to automatically create the report, workflow, app, website, or chatbot just by describing what they need.

By using these tools together, you can enhance productivity and make your business more efficient.

## What is the business value of Microsoft Power Platform?

There are two main ways in which Power Platform creates business value for organizations:

* **Reducing development costs**: It provides the building blocks for teams to create custom solutions in much less time than required when starting by scratch. Teams can build custom apps in just a matter of days or weeks.
* **Enabling more agile, scalable development**: The low-code philosophy is central to Power Platform. It allows for faster, more agile solution development. It empowers citizen developers, that is, employees with less coding expertise, to provide working solutions to end users. Professional developers can iterate on this version for further improvement. This collaborative development approach implies solutions are available to end users at an earlier stage and are less costly. This structure is easy to escalate by adding custom functionality.

The diagram shows how this fusion development approach works.

> **Customer story**: An energy provider has enabled over 4,300 Power Platform makers and created over 300 Power Platform solutions that generate almost USD 75 million in savings annually. In a single example of how Power Platform adoption has benefited the company, IT help desk agents were often burdened with mundane and repetitive requests that led to increased wait times for workers and reduced overall productivity. Today, 25%-40% of their help desk demand is fulfilled by an AI-powered chatbot built using Microsoft Copilot Studio. The increased efficiency resulting from the chatbot has saved the company more than $1.1 million annually and given help desk agents more time to focus on issues that require human interventionâ€”which has improved the overall service level for their customers.
