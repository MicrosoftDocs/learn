AI is disrupting every industry and every business. For the last decade, AI has enabled companies of all sizes to achieve better business results. There's already a **mainstream business use of AI** thanks to these three trends:

* Access to massive amounts of data.
* Access to massive computing power through the cloud.
* Access to AI algorithms.

AI is experiencing major breakthroughs. A new generation of Large Language Models (LLMs) enables new use cases that weren't possible a few years ago, such as those based on high-quality generative AI. Based on these technologies, organizations will experience a **second wave of AI-powered transformation**. However, businesses need an easy way to access the latest AI capabilities to take full advantage of them.

Microsoft is working to democratize AI use. It has designed a wide range of solutions and services to bring AI to everyone, irrespective of their level of AI expertise. There are four approaches, varying based on the level of AI and coding expertise required.


|**Microsoft Approach**|**Description**|
|-|-|
|**Microsoft Copilot** ![Photograph showing people at computers and the Microsoft Copilot logo.](../media/3-copilots.png)|Microsoft has embedded AI in everyday applications, so business users can benefit from it even if they don't have coding or data science expertise. In this approach, AI is delivered as Software as a Service (SaaS) and becomes transparent, that is, it's fully integrated within the provided service without users having to worry about it. For example, Microsoft Copilot for Microsoft 365 incorporates the latest generative AI in the shape of a virtual assistant that performs tasks for you in Microsoft 365 apps.|
|**Microsoft Power Platform** ![Photograph showing person at computer and the Power Platform logo.](../media/3-power-platform.png)|A suite of low-code products that help you build different pieces of applications. These products have a layer of AI, but it's transparent as well and you can benefit from it without handling it directly.|
|**Azure AI Services** ![Photograph showing person at computer and the Azure AI services logo.](../media/3-azure-ai-services.png)|These are the solutions for users who want to deliver an AI project but have little data science expertise. They offer pretrained AI models for you to reuse or customize.|
|**Azure Machine Learning** ![Photograph showing person at computer and the Azure Machine Learning logo.](../media/3-azure-machine-learning.png)|All machine learning tasks can be handled from this service. It helps data science teams in setting, automating, and enabling machine learning best practices.|

Microsoft has designed all these products and services following [strict responsible AI principles](https://www.microsoft.com/ai/responsible-ai?activetab=pivot1:primaryr6). Any AI implementation should be equally respectful.

The rest of this module covers each of these options. Next, we'll explore the simplest approachâ€”AI as a copilot, seamlessly integrated into everyday applications.
