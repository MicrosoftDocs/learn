In this module, you explored the foundational concepts and practices for designing agent-driven workflows in Microsoft Foundry. You began by understanding what workflows are and why they provide a structured way to orchestrate AI reasoning, logic, and user interaction. You then learned how to compose workflows by combining nodes—including agents, logic, data transformation, and chat—into sequences that define both actions and control flow.

You discovered how agents generate structured outputs, how these outputs are captured in variables, and how they drive workflow decisions such as routing, escalation, or continuation. You also explored how Power Fx acts as a low-code “glue” language, enabling workflows to transform data, evaluate conditions, and iterate over multiple items using loops. The module emphasized how variables, conditions, and loops move data through a workflow, creating adaptive, intelligent behavior.

Finally, you learned how to maintain and refine workflows using versioning, notes, and dual visual/YAML representations. These practices ensure that workflows remain reliable, understandable, and scalable—ready for real-world, enterprise applications.

By combining these concepts, you now have the knowledge to design workflows that integrate AI agents, control logic, human input, and data transformation into coherent, maintainable systems. This foundation prepares you to implement and experiment with workflows in hands-on scenarios, giving you the skills to build robust automation solutions with confidence.
