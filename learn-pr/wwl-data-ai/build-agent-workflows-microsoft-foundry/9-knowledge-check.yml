  questions:
  - content: "Which type of node in a Foundry workflow is used to invoke an AI agent?"
    choices:
    - content: "Logic node"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Logic nodes handle conditions and control flow, not agent invocation."
    - content: "Agent node"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Agent nodes are used to invoke AI agents within a workflow."
    - content: "Data transformation node"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Data transformation nodes manipulate variables or parse values, not invoke agents."
  - content: "Which node type would you use to handle multiple tickets in a workflow without duplicating nodes?"
    choices:
    - content: "If/Else node"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. If/Else nodes control branching, not repeated processing of multiple items."
    - content: "For-Each node"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. For-Each nodes loop over collections, allowing workflows to process multiple inputs efficiently."
    - content: "Send message node"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Send message nodes communicate with the user but don't handle looping."
  - content: "Which of the following best describes how structured agent outputs are used in workflows?"
    choices:
    - content: "They are ignored once generated, since agents always handle routing automatically"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Structured outputs are essential for routing, decisions, and conditional logic."
    - content: "They provide predictable data that can be stored in variables, evaluated with conditions, and trigger workflow steps"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Structured outputs allow workflows to make decisions programmatically, route requests, and escalate as needed."
    - content: "They replace the need for loops and If/Else nodes"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Structured outputs are used *with* loops and conditional logic, not instead of them."
