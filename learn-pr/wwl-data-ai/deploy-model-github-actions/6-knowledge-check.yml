  questions:
  - content: "When a machine learning model needs to generate predictions on new data every week, what is the appropriate model deployment?"
    choices:
    - content: "Private endpoint"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A private endpoint refers to a network interface."
    - content: "Online endpoint"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Use online endpoints for real-time predictions."
    - content: "Batch endpoint"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Use batch endpoints when you want to generate a batch of predictions."
  - content: "Which assets will be autogenerated when using no-code deployment with an MLflow model?"
    choices:
    - content: "The training and scoring script."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The training script is necessary to create and log the MLflow model."
    - content: "The scoring script and environment."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. When a model is logged with MLflow, the scoring script and environment are created by the Azure Machine Learning workspace during deployment."
    - content: "The scoring script and deployment configuration."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. It's still necessary to configure the deployment of the model to the endpoint."
