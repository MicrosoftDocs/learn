title: Implement multi-stage reasoning in Azure Databricks
summary: Multi-stage reasoning systems break down complex problems into multiple stages or steps, with each stage focusing on a specific reasoning task. The output of one stage serves as the input for the next, allowing for a more structured and systematic approach to problem-solving. 
abstract: |
  In this module, you learn how to:
  - Identify the need for multi-stage reasoning systems.
  - Describe a multi-stage reasoning workflow.
  - Implement multi-stage reasoning with libraries like LangChain, LlamaIndex, Haystack, and the DSPy framework.
prerequisites: |
  Before starting this module, you should be familiar with Azure Databricks. Consider completing [Explore Azure Databricks](/training/modules/explore-azure-databricks?azure-portal=true) before starting this module.
