**Large Language Models** (**LLMs**) are advanced artificial intelligence systems designed to understand and generate human-like text based on vast amounts of data. These models, such as GPT-4 and Llama, revolutionized natural language processing by enabling machines to perform tasks like translation, summarization, and even creative writing with remarkable accuracy.

However, despite their impressive capabilities, LLMs often face challenges when it comes to complex reasoning tasks. Traditional methods encourage LLMs to plan and solve problems independently or to sample extensive reasoning chains, which can lead to conceptual and inferential fallacies.

To address these limitations, you can use **multi-stage reasoning systems**. These systems break down complex problems into *multiple stages or steps*, with each stage focusing on a specific reasoning task. The output of one stage serves as the input for the next, allowing for a more structured and systematic approach to problem-solving.

In Azure Databricks, you can create multi-stage reasoning systems using popular libraries. When you combine the computing power of Apache Spark, the reliable data storage of Delta Lake, and advanced machine learning libraries, Databricks makes it easy to efficiently process complex tasks.
