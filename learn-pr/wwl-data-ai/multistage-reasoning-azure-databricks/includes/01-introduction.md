While Large Language Models excel at many tasks, they often struggle with complex reasoning that requires multiple steps or different types of analysis. Traditional approaches ask LLMs to solve everything at once, which can lead to errors in logic and inference.

**Multi-stage reasoning systems** address these limitations by breaking complex problems into sequential steps. Each stage focuses on a specific reasoning task, with the output of one stage serving as input for the next. This structured approach reduces errors and improves the reliability of complex problem-solving.

The diagram illustrates this difference: instead of using one complex model to handle everything, a multi-stage system uses specialized components that work together systematically. Each stage can be optimized for its specific task, leading to better overall results.

In this module, you'll explore how to work with multi-stage reasoning systems using Azure Databricks. Azure Databricks provides access to popular libraries like LangChain, LlamaIndex, Haystack, and DSPy that support building these systems. You'll learn about these libraries' key components and understand how they can be applied to implement multi-stage reasoning workflows.
