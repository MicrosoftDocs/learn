Multi-stage reasoning on Azure Databricks involves breaking down complex analytical tasks into sequential stages, where each stage builds upon the results of the previous one.

Multi-stage reasoning helps you design modular, scalable workflows that improve the accuracy of AI-generated output. In Azure Databricks, you can use frameworks like LangChain, LlamaIndex, Haystack, or DSPy to implement multi-stage reasoning, each offering different approaches to reasoning and optimization.
