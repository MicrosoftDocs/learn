  questions:
  - content: "What is a key advantage of using multi-stage reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs)?"
    choices:
    - content: "It reduces the overall computational cost."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Multi-stage reasoning doesn't reduce the overall computational cost."
    - content: "Dividing a complex problem into smaller and more manageable tasks."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Multi-stage reasoning involves dividing a complex problem into smaller, more manageable tasks that the model can solve sequentially. This approach improves the modelâ€™s ability to handle intricate reasoning processes by addressing each subtask independently before combining the results to solve the overall problem."
    - content: "It eliminates the need for external data sources."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Multi-stage reasoning doesn't eliminate the need for external data sources."
  - content: "Which framework is commonly used for managing multi-stage reasoning systems in LLMs?"
    choices:
    - content: "Tensorflow"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. TensorFlow is an open-source platform used for building and deploying deep learning models."
    - content: "PyTorch"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. PyTorch is an open-source deep learning framework used for developing and training machine learning models, with a focus on flexibility and dynamic computation graphs."
    - content: "LangChain"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. LangChain is a popular framework that helps build complex reasoning systems by linking different reasoning tasks together."
  - content: "In the context of multi-stage reasoning with LLMs, what is the primary role of a 'retriever' in a retriever-based chain?"
    choices:
    - content: "To generate new data based on the initial input."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The 'retriever' isn't used to generate new data."
    - content: "To retrieve relevant information or documents that can be used in subsequent reasoning stages."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. In a retriever-based chain, the retriever is responsible for fetching relevant information or documents from a predefined dataset or knowledge base. This retrieved information is then passed on to subsequent stages in the reasoning process, where it can be used to generate a more informed and accurate response."
    - content: "To execute logical operations like AND, OR, and NOT."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The 'retriever' isn't used to execute logical operations like AND, OR and NOT."
