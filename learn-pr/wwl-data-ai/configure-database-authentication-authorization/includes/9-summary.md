Azure SQL offerings provide several authentication and authorization options that differ from those in SQL Server. This is because Azure SQL Database and Azure SQL Managed Instance rely on Microsoft Entra ID instead of Windows Server Active Directory.

This module explores best practices for granting permissions and the various permissions available within a database. It also delves into the concept of *least privilege*. While built-in roles in SQL Server and other database engines offer broad security privileges, many applications require more granular security on database objects.

Now that you've reviewed this module, you should be able to:

- Explain authentication options for Azure SQL offerings
- Describe security principals
- Explain object permissions
- Identify authentication and authorization failures
