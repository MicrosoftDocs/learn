Security principals are entities that can request SQL Server resources and to which you can (usually) grant permissions. There are several sets of security principals in SQL Server. Security principals exist at either the server level or the database level and can be either individuals or collections. Some sets have a membership controlled by the SQL Server administrators, and some have a fixed membership.

 >New logins can be added by administrators on Azure SQL Database, but new server roles can't be created.

## Schemas and securables

Before we look at the details of security principals, we need to understand the concepts of securables and schemas. SQL Server and Azure SQL Database have three scopes for securables. Securables are the resources within the database to which the authorization system manages access. For example, a table is a securable. To simplify access control, SQL Server contains securables in nested hierarchies called scopes. The three securable scopes are the server, the database, and the schema. A schema is a collection of objects within your database, which allows objects to be grouped into separate namespaces.

Every user has a default schema. If a user tries to access an object without specifying a schema name, as in: `SELECT name FROM customers`, it's assumed the object is in the user’s default schema. If there's no such object in the default schema, SQL Server checks to see if the object is in the predefined dbo schema. If there's no object of the specified name in either the user’s default schema, or in the dbo schema, the user receives an error message. It's a best practice to specify the schema name when accessing objects, so the previous select would be something like:
`SELECT name FROM SalesSchema.customers`. If a user hasn't been given a default schema, their default schema is set to dbo.

By default, if no schema is specified when a user creates an object, SQL Server attempts to create it in the user’s default schema. If the user hasn't been granted permission to create objects in their default schema, the object can't be created.

## Logins and users

No matter the mode of authentication that is used, a login name used to access your SQL database is set up as a login within the instance. Those logins are set up at the instance level of SQL Server and stored in the master database. However, you can configure contained users, which are added at the database level. These users can be configured as SQL Server Authentication users and either Windows Authentication users or Microsoft Entra users (depending on which platform you're using). In order to create these users, the database must be configured for partial containment, which is configured by default in Azure SQL Database, and optionally configurable in SQL Server.

These users only have access to the database that the user is set up with. For the purposes of Azure SQL Database, it's a best practice to create users at the scope of the user database, and not in the master database.

```sql
CREATE USER [dba@contoso.com] FROM EXTERNAL PROVIDER;
GO
```

The `CREATE USER` statement is executed in the context of the user database. In the example, the user is a Microsoft Entra user as indicated with the `FROM EXTERNAL PROVIDER` syntax.

If logins are created at the instance level in SQL Server, a user should then be created within the database, which maps the user to the server-based login as shown in the following example.

```sql
USE [master]
GO

CREATE LOGIN demo WITH PASSWORD = 'Pa55.w.rd'
GO

USE [WideWorldImporters]
GO

CREATE USER demo FROM LOGIN demo
GO
```

The login is first created in the master database, and then in the WideWorldImporters database a user is created to map to that user. Logins are used to access the SQL Server or the Azure SQL Database, but to do any work within a database, the login must be mapped to a username. The username is used for all authentication.

Logins and usernames are the most important security principals you need to be aware of, but the next sections describe some of the other concepts and terms when dealing with authorization.

## Database roles

As you can imagine, database security can get complicated for applications with many users. In order to make it easier for both administrators and auditors, most database applications use role-based security. Roles are effectively security groups that share a common set of permissions. Combining permissions into a role allows a set of roles to be created for a given application. Some examples of roles would be administrators who had full access to all of the databases and servers, reporting users who only read the database, and an application account that had access to write data into the database. The roles can be defined when the application is designed, and then users can be assigned to those roles as they need access to the database. Role-based access control is a common architecture across computer systems and is how authorization is managed in Azure Resource Manager.

SQL Server and Azure SQL Database both include built-in roles that are defined by Microsoft, and also provide the option to create custom roles. Custom roles can be created at the server or database level. However, server roles can't be granted access to objects within a database directly. Server roles are only available in SQL Server and Azure SQL Managed Instance, not in Azure SQL Database.

Within a database, permissions can be granted to the users that exist within the database. If multiple users all need the same permissions, you can create a database role within the database and grant the needed permissions to this role. Users can be added as members of the database role. The member of the database role inherits the permissions of the database role.

```sql
CREATE USER [DP300User1] WITH PASSWORD = 'Pa55.w.rd'
GO

CREATE USER [DP300User2] WITH PASSWORD = 'Pa55.w.rd'
GO

CREATE ROLE [SalesReader]
GO

ALTER ROLE [SalesReader] ADD MEMBER [DP300User1]
GO

ALTER ROLE [SalesReader] ADD MEMBER [DP300User2]
GO

GRANT SELECT, EXECUTE ON SCHEMA::Sales TO [SalesReader]
GO
```

In the above example, you can see that two users are created, and then a role called SalesReader is created. The two new users are added to the newly created role, and then finally the role is granted `SELECT` and `EXECUTE` permissions on the *Sales* schema. Any user who is in that role can select from any object in the *Sales* schema, and execute any stored procedure in the schema.

## Application roles

Application roles can also be created within a SQL Server database or Azure SQL Database. Unlike database roles, users aren't made members of an application role. An application role is activated by the user, by supplying the preconfigured password for the application role. Once the role is activated the permissions that are applied to the application role are applied to the user until that role is deactivated.

## Built-in database roles

Microsoft SQL Server contains several fixed database roles within each database for which the permissions are predefined. Users can be added as members of one or more roles. These roles give their members a predefined set of permissions. These roles work the same within Azure SQL Database and SQL Server.

| Database role | Definition |
|------------|-------------|
|**db_accessadmin** | Allows users to create other users within the database. This role doesn't grant access to the schema of any of the tables, nor does it grant access to the data within the database. |
|**db_backupoperator** | Allows users to back up a database in a SQL Server or SQL Managed Instance. The role *db_backupoperator* doesn't confer any permissions in an Azure SQL Database. |
|**db_datareader** | Allows users to read from every table and view within the database. |
|**db_datawriter** | Allows users to `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` data from every table and view within the database. |
|**db_ddladmin** | Allows users to create or modify objects within the database. Members of this role can change the definition of any object, of any type, but members of this role aren't granted access to read or write any data within the databases. |
|**db_denydatareader** | Users who need to be prevented from reading data from any object in the database, when those users have been granted rights through other roles or directly. |
|**db_denydatawriter** | Users who need to be prevented from writing data to any object in the database, when those users have been granted rights through other roles or directly. |
|**db_securityadmin** | Users who need to be able to grant access to other users within the database. Members of this role aren't granted access to the data within the database; however members of this role can grant themselves access to the tables within the database. Membership in this database role should be limited to only trusted users. |
|**db_owner** | Users who need administrative access to the database. Members of this role can perform any action within the database by default. However, unlike the actual database owner, who has the user name *dbo*, users in the `db_owner` role can be blocked from accessing data by placing them in other database roles, such as `db_denydatareader`, or by denying them access to objects. Membership in this database role should be limited to only trusted users. |

All users within a database are automatically members of the `public` role. By default, this role has no permissions granted to it. Permissions can be granted to the public role, but you should consider carefully whether that is really something you want to do. Granting permissions to the public role would grant these permissions to any user, including the guest account, if the guest account was enabled.

The built-in database roles do meet the needs of many applications; however with applications that require more granular security (for example, when you only want to grant access to a specific subset of tables) a custom role is often a better choice.

 > [!NOTE]
 >By default, users in roles like *db_owner* can always see all of the data in the database. Applications can take advantage of encryption options like **Always Encrypted** to protect sensitive data from privileged users.

For Azure SQL Database, there are a few nuances. You can have logins that exist in the virtual `master` database, database users, and even contained database users for Microsoft Entra accounts (recommended). Although the server admin for Azure SQL Database essentially has `sysadmin` rights, you can create more limited admins by using server or database level roles. Two database level roles are available for SQL Database that only exist in the virtual `master` database:

| Database Role | Definition |
|------------|-------------|
|**loginmanager** | Allows members to create logins for the database server. This role is the equivalent of the `dbcreator` fixed server role in an on-premises Microsoft SQL Server. |
|**dbmanager** | Allows members to create and delete databases for the database server. This role is the equivalent of the `securityadmin` fixed server role in an on-premises Microsoft SQL Server. |

## Fixed server-level roles

In addition to database roles, SQL Server and Azure SQL Managed Instance both provide several fixed server-level roles. These roles assign permissions at the scope of the entire server. Server-level principals, which include SQL Server logins, Windows accounts, and Windows group can be added into fixed server-level roles. The permissions for fixed server-level roles are predefined, and no new server roles can be added.

| Fixed server-level role | Definition |
|------------|-------------|
|**sysadmin** |  Allows its members to perform any activity on the server.
|**serveradmin** |  Allows its members to change server-wide configuration settings (for example Max Server Memory) and can shut down the server. |
|**securityadmin** | Allows its members to manage logins and their properties (for example, changing the password of a login). The members can also grant and revoke server and database level permissions. This role should be treated as being equivalent to the sysadmin role. |
|**processadmin** | Allows its members to kill processes running inside of SQL Server. |
|**setupadmin** | Allows its members to add and remove linked servers using T-SQL. |
|**bulkadmin** | Allows its members to run the `BULK INSERT` T-SQL statement. |
|**diskadmin** | Allows its members to have the ability to manage backup devices in SQL Server. |
|**dbcreator** | Allows its members to create, restore, alter, and drop any database. |
|**public** | Every SQL Server login belongs to the public user role. Unlike the other fixed server roles, permissions can be granted, denied, or revoked from the public role. |
