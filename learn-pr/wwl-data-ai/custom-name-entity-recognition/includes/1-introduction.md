Custom *named entity recognition* (NER), otherwise known as custom entity extraction, is one of the many features for *natural language processing* (NLP) offered by Azure AI Language service. Custom NER enables developers to extract predefined entities from text documents, without those documents being in a known format - such as legal agreements or online ads.

An entity is a person, place, thing, event, skill, or value.

In this module, you'll learn how to use the Azure AI Language service to extract entities from unstructured documents.

After completing this module, you'll be able to:

- Understand custom named entities and how they're labeled.
- Build a custom named entity extraction project.
- Label data, train, and deploy an entity extraction model.
- Submit extraction tasks from your own app.
