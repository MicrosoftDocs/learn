  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "You've trained your model and you're seeing that it doesn't recognize your entities. What metric score is likely low to indicate that issue?"
    choices:
    - content: "Recall"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That answer's correct. Recall indicates how well the model extracts entities, regardless of which entity that is."
    - content: "Precision"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That answer's incorrect. Recall indicates how well the model extracts entities, regardless of which entity that is."
    - content: "F1 score"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That answer's incorrect. Recall indicates how well the model extracts entities, regardless of which entity that is."
  - content: "You just finished labeling your data. How and where is that file stored to train your model?"
    choices:
    - content: "JSON file, in my storage account container for the project"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That answer's correct. The JSON file lives next to the dataset in your container for the model to use during training."
    - content: "XML file, in my local project folder"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That answer's incorrect. The JSON file lives next to the dataset in your container for the model to use during training."
    - content: "YAML file, anywhere in my Azure account"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That answer's incorrect. The JSON file lives next to the dataset in your container for the model to use during training."
  - content: "You train your model with only one source of documents, even though real extraction tasks will come from several sources. What data quality metric do you need to increase?"
    choices:
    - content: "Distribution"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That answer's incorrect. Having the right data diversity will lead to better extraction performance."
    - content: "Accuracy"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That answer's incorrect. Having the right data diversity will lead to better extraction performance."
    - content: "Diversity"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That answer's correct. Having the right data diversity will lead to better extraction performance."
