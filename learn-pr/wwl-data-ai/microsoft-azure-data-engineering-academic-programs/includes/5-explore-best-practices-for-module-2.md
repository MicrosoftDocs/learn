Module 2 Tips and Tricks 

- Serverless is for data exploration or transformation 
- Dedicated is for data warehousing workloads 
- Understand the dependencies and order for metadata object creation  
	- They remain the same for serverless or dedicated 
- Strongly prefer Microsoft Entra authentication 

Module 2 Demos 

- Run “SELECT @@VERSION” on serverless and dedicated pools to show underlying technologies 
- Demonstrate opening a file in Data Lake and show the syntax of the generated statement  
	- Note that OPENROWSET will only work in serverless pools as it is available in Azure SQL Database, but not in Dedicated SQL pools
