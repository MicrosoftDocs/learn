DP-203: Module 10 Real-time stream processing with Azure Stream Analytics 

Module 10 Overview 

As you begin to teach this module, get familiar with what the students will learn during the module. In this module students will learn about real-time stream processing with Stream Analytics, the difference between streaming analytics as a pattern or processing streams and Stream Analytics as the name of a service or resource.

Module 10 Tips and Tricks 

- Event Hubs is only one way of processing data streams, but is quick to set up 
- Focus on the architecture because in the next module, the component that changes is Stream Analytics to Spark/Databricks 
- The names of the windowing functions here don’t exactly match the names of windowing functions in Databricks or elsewhere, but this is the terminology for Stream Analytics  

Module 10 Demo 

- Open the Stream Analytics job, look at the topology, inputs, outputs, query, and User Defined Functions 

Module 10 Lab/Exercise 

- Real-time stream processing with Stream Analytics (~45 min)
