DP-203: Module 1 Explore compute and storage options for data engineering workloads 

Module 1 Overview 

As you begin to teach this module, get familiar with what the students will learn during the module. In this module students will be introduced to some of the compute and storage options for data engineering workloads. 

This module consists of five lessons: 

- Lesson 1 – Introduction to Azure Synapse Analytics 
- Lesson 2 – Describe Azure Databricks 
- Lesson 3 – Introduction to Azure Data Lake storage 
- Lesson 4 – Describe Delta Lake architecture 
- Lesson 5 – Work with data streams by using Azure Stream Analytics

Module 1 Tips and Tricks 

- Avoid the temptation to teach the whole class in module 1 
- Only introduce Synapse, and Azure Data Lake Storage 
- Emphasize that Data Bricks is a separate service from Synapse 
- Introduce Data Lake as an alternative to Lambda Architecture 

Module 1 Demos 

- Portal vs Synapse Studio 
- Portal vs Databricks Workspace 

Module 1 Labs/Exercises 

- Explore compute and storage options for data engineering workloads (~45min) 
	- Walk through opening the Databricks Workspace with students 
	- Point out that cells that say start streams will not complete 
		- Students must continue with the next cell as soon as the stream starts 
		- Point out that all steps for setting up AND querying the Delta Lake are in one notebook
