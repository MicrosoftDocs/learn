Module 8 Tips and Tricks 

- Remember the principle of “layers of protection.” Present this module as layers 
- Emphasize key vault, and that keys, secrets, and passwords should never be where they can make it to code repositories 
- Microsoft Entra managed identities can minimize the need for keys, secrets, and passwords 

Module 8 Demos 

- Set up Active Directory Admin on Synapse 
- Set up firewall rules on Synapse  
- Open key vault and view secrets created by setup script
