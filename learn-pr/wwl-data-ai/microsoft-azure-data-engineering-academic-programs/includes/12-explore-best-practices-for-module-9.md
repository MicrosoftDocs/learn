DP-203: Module 9 Support hybrid transactional analytical processing with Azure Synapse Link 

Module 9 Overview 

As you begin to teach this module, get familiar with what the students will learn during the module. In this module students will learn about hybrid transactional analytical processing, how to flatten out data to identify attributes, and extract the minimum amount of data to make processing more efficient. They will also learn about how to query the Azure Synapse workspace in an Apache Spark pool or with an OPENROWSET. 

This module consists of four lessons: 

- Lesson 1 – Design hybrid transactional and analytical processing using Azure Synapse Analytics 
- Lesson 2 – Configure Azure Synapse Link with Azure Cosmos database 
- Lesson 3 – Query Azure Cosmos database with Apache Spark for Azure Synapse Analytics  
- Lesson 4 – Query Azure Cosmos database with SQL Serverless for Azure Synapse Analytics

Module 9 Tips and Tricks 

- Remember that Cosmos database is not an analytical engine 
- The analytical store allows Cosmos to be a data store for analytical engines such as Synapse 
- Remember that steps such as “Flattening JSON data” and creating final data frames are examples, not a process that is followed in every transformation 

Module 9 Demos 

- Enable analytical store on Cosmos database 
- Walk through steps that are done in the lab
