DP-203: Module 4 Explore, transform, and load data into the data warehouse using Apache Spark 

Module 4 Overview 

As you begin to teach this module, get familiar with what the students will learn during the module. In this module students will learn how to move from Databricks, which was Apache Spark, back into the Synapse Studio for Apache Spark and Apache Spark pools. 

This module consists of four lessons: 

- Lesson 1 – Understand big data engineering with Apache Spark in Azure Synapse Analytics 
- Lesson 2 – Ingest data with Apache Spark notebooks in Azure Synapse Analytics 
- Lesson 3 – Transform data with DataFrames in Apache Spark Pools in Azure Synapse Analytics 
- Lesson 4 – Integrate SQL and Apache Spark pools in Azure Synapse Analytics

Module 4 Tips and Tricks 

- The notebooks may look different, but much of what you know from Databricks will apply directly to Synapse Spark Pools 
- The slides on types of transformations are examples – not every transformation involves these steps 
- Synapse Spark Pools integrates with other Azure Data Stores 
- Nothing moves data into Dedicated SQL Pools faster than Polybase (or Copy), but Synapse Spark Pools knows that 

Module 4 Demos 

- Look at clusters and logs 
- Show default language in new notebook 
- Run quick commands in a new notebook 

Module 4 Lab/Exercise
