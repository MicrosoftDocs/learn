  questions:
  - content: "Which technology is typically used as a staging area in a modern data warehousing architecture?"
    choices:
    - content: "Azure Data Lake."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Azure Data Lake Store Gen 2 is the technology that will be used to stage data before loading it into the various components of Azure Synapse Analytics."
    - content: "Azure Synapse SQL Pools."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Azure Synapse SQL Pools are used to store relational big data solutions such as a data warehouse."
    - content: "Azure Synapse Spark Pools."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Azure Synapse Spark Pools are used to perform big data engineering or machine learning operations."
  - content: "Which component enables you to perform code free transformations in Azure Synapse Analytics?"
    choices:
    - content: "Studio."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Studio is the user interface that enables you to interact with the components of Azure Synapse Analytics."
    - content: "Copy activity."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The Copy Activity copies data between the source and destination."
    - content: "Mapping Data Flow."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. You can natively perform data transformations with Azure Data Factory code free using the Mapping Data Flow task."
  - content: "Which transformation in the Mapping Data Flow is used to route data rows to different streams based on matching conditions?"
    choices:
    - content: "Lookup."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A Lookup transformation is used to add reference data from another source to your Data Flow."
    - content: "Conditional Split."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. A Conditional Split transformation routes data rows to different streams based on matching conditions. The conditional split transformation is similar to a CASE decision structure in a programming language."
    - content: "Select."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A Select transformation is used for selecting and/or defining your columns."
  - content: "Which transformation is used to load data into a data store or compute resource?"
    choices:
    - content: "Window."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A Window transformation is where you will define window-based aggregations of columns in your data streams."
    - content: "Source."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A Source transformation configures your data source for the data flow. When designing data flows, your first step will always be configuring a source transformation."
    - content: "Sink."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. A Sink transformation allows you to choose a dataset definition for the destination output data. You can have as many sink transformations as your data flow requires."
