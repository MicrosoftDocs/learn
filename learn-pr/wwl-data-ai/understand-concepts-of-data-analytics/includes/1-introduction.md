Understanding key concepts of data analytics will help you and your team begin to explore and make the best use of your data.

Suppose that the sales manager at Contoso wants to understand sales and marketing trends for the year. They've asked you to analyze data from the last two years to guide their next steps. What are the data showing? Why are sales trending upward? What should the sales team do to continue to increase sales? Before you can begin your analysis, your team reviews data analytics concepts to be sure you're using the right type of analytics for the job.

By the end of this module, you'll understand how different types of analytics may respond to the sales manager's questions. You'll also be able to describe the process of exploring and using data, along with types of data and how they're stored.
