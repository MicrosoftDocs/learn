As you're preparing to teach this Learning Path, get familiar with what the students learn during the Learning Path. In this Learning Path, students learn about natural language processing (NLP) using text analysis, translation, speech-to-text, and to speech services. Students also learn about recent changes to different NLP-related services including new features, new names, and deprecation of some traditional services.

- Lesson 1 – Analyze and translate text
- Lesson 2 – Build a question answering solution
- Lesson 3 – Build a conversational language understanding app
- Lesson 4 – Custom classification and named entity extraction
- Lesson 5 – Speech recognition, synthesis, and translation
