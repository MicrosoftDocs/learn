Virtual Educator Prep Sessions (VEPS) are part of the Microsoft Learn for Educators (MSLE) program, and they're a critical piece of preparing to teach Microsoft technical skills as a part of our program. MSLE is anchored in the belief that higher education institutions and faculty members play a pivotal role in empowering students for future success. We at Microsoft are committed to supporting students, faculty members, and higher education institutions with free curriculum training and tools for teaching technical skills.

In this learning path, you'll learn tips and tricks from Microsoft technical trainers about preparing for your first teaching session, which labs to use, and how to introduce technical topics. You'll also discover other resources and materials that may help your students succeed on their Microsoft certification exams.
