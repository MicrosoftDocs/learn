AI-102: Learning Path 2 Develop computer vision solutions with Azure AI Vision

As you're preparing to teach this Learning Path, get familiar with what the students learn during the Learning Path. In this Learning Path, students learn about image analysis, object classification, object detection, and how to detect, analyze, and recognize faces. Students will also learn about the different tools available for customizing division models for performing some tasks like detection or classification.

This Learning Path consists of two lessons:
- Lesson 1 – Get Started with Cognitive Services
- Lesson 2 – Use Cognitive Services for Enterprise Applications
