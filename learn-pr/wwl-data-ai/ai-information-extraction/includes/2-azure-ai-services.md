Azure AI provides a wide range of cloud-based services for various AI tasks, including the extraction and analysis of information from digital content.

Core services used in information extraction scenarios include:

| Service | Description |
| -- | -- |
| ![Azure AI Vision icon.](../media/azure-ai-vision.png)<br/> **Azure AI Vision Image Analysis** | Azure AI Vision Image Analysis enables you to extract insights from images, including the detection and identification of common objects in images, the generation of relevant captions and tags for images, and the extraction of text in images. |
| ![Azure AI Content Understanding icon.](../media/content-understanding.png)<br/> **Azure AI Content Understanding** | Azure AI Content Understanding is a generative AI-based multimodal analysis service that can extract insights from structured documents, images, audio, and video.|
| ![Azure AI Document Intelligence icon.](../media/document-intelligence.png)<br/> **Azure AI Document Intelligence** | Azure AI Document Intelligence is designed to extract fields and values from digital (or digitized) forms, such as invoices, receipts, purchase orders, and others.|
| ![Azure AI Search icon.](../media/ai-search.png)<br/> **Azure AI Search** | Azure AI Search performs AI-assisted indexing in which a pipeline of AI *skills* are used to systematically extract and index information from structured and unstructured content.|

You can use each of these services separately, or combine them to build comprehensive solutions for:

- **Data capture**: Intelligently scanning images to capture and store data values. For example, using a cellphone camera to extract contact information from a business card.
- **Business process automation**: Reading data from forms and using it to trigger workflows. For example, extracting cost center and billing information from invoices and routing them to the appropriate accounts-payable department for processing.
- **Meeting summarization and analysis**: Analyzing and summarizing key points from recorded phone conversations or video conference calls. For example, automating note-taking and action assignments for a team meeting.
- **Digital asset management (DAM)**: Managing digital assets like images or videos by automatically tagging and indexing them. For example, to create a searchable library of stock photographs.
- **Knowledge Mining**: Extracting key information from structured and unstructured data to be used for further analysis and reporting. For example, compiling census data from scanned records to populate a database.
