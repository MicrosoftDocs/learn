## Outline the units

1. **Securing You - Introduction and Overview**

    (Story/Scenario around breaches and bad actors - STRIKE Daily News example? embed HTML image?)
    
    This is our neighborhood now – it is full of hackers, malware and bots that are constantly looking for weaknesses in cyberdefenses of big corporations and even individuals. Billions of credentials are now available on the dark web – this includes usernames and cleartext or weakly protected passwords from your frequently visited sites and online services.

    Hackers often employ a technique called "credential stuffing" where special tools are used that steal usernames and passwords leaked via data breaches at other sites. If the username-password combos matched, these were published for purchasing on the dark web. In some cases, hackers have also published the tools they used to let other hackers try these techniques for themselves. The result? Hackers are able to gain access to user accounts and can even attempt to compromise devices and assets belonging to the user.
