  questions:

  - content: "Which password approach is the most secure?"
    choices:
    - content: "A five-letter password with the first letter capitalized."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This password is too simple and can be easily guessed or cracked."
    - content: "The word *password* with special characters and numbers mixed in."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This is a common password variation that should never be used for any account."
    - content: "A five-word passphrase with some numbers mixed in."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Great! Having five different, unrelated words in a passphrase provides enough complexity to keep it from being guessed or cracked."
    - content: "Your birthday in numbers followed by your name."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "You should avoid creating a password that contains information that can be guessed, is associated with a social media account, or might already be available in other leaked account data."

  - content: "What is the most secure approach to create a password when you're creating a new account?"
    choices:
    - content: "Create a new and easy-to-remember password."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Though better than using the same password, simple passwords are easy to guess and can be easily cracked."
    - content: "Create a unique, long, complicated password or passphrase."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Good job. The more complex your password is, the harder it will be for hackers to crack it."
    - content: "Reuse your favorite password, as long as you know it has not been exposed in a breach."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Never reuse any of your passwords, because one or more of them have already been stolen in a breach."
    - content: "Use *correct horse battery staple*."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Don't use any examples you read about. Always come up with your own, and make them as random as possible."
