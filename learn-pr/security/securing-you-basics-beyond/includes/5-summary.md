In this module, you learned about phishing, how to identify it, and what to do if you receive an email that looks suspicious.

You learned how to use passphrases to make your credentials even more secure, why you should use a unique password for each account, and how to store your credentials securely in a password manager.

You also learned how to add another layer of security to your accounts by using multifactor authentication.

What should you do now?

- Install a password manager and go through the setup instructions.
- Configure multifactor authentication for your password manager.
- Change any passwords or passphrases for accounts where you used the same ones, and store the new ones in your password manager.
- Configure multifactor authentication on every account that supports it.

Feel free to pass the ideas, tools, and techniques in this training (or the link to the training itself) to your friends and family.
