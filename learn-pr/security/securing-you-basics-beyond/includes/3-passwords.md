Let's start with the basics. What are passwords, and what are they for? In the scenarios we're discussing, a password is a secret that proves you're the owner of the username that you use when signing in to a service. Without the password, a username by itself won't give you access to an account.

## What are credentials?

Credentials are the combination of a username and a password. The username is the identifier of your user account, such as your email address or a name that you chose. The password is the *secret* part of your credentials.

Some accounts let you create a special username that's different from your email address. Others might require that you use your personal email address. In any case, the username isn't meant to be a secret, but the password is.

## How secret are your passwords?

Many passwords aren't as secret as people think they are. *Billions* of username/password combinations are currently for sale, but even more are available for free. Where did they all come from? Previous breaches. Thousands of breaches happen every year. Those breaches expose all kinds of personal data, along with account information that often includes usernames and passwords.

What is a *data breach*, and why should you care? A data breach is theft of information that shouldn't be public. This often happens when a hacker takes advantage of flaws in a security system or just takes the data after a company accidentally exposes a database with no security settings turned on. That information can then be used for identity theft, blackmail, harassment, and other crimes.

Even an account that you might not care about, such as an email account that you don't use anymore, can be used by an attacker to pretend to be you. The attacker might send email with malware to your contacts or sign up for other accounts with your name. There are many other bad uses for stolen accounts.

> If your information shows up here, don't worry. Just change the passwords for any identified accounts, and store your new secrets in your password manager (which we'll discuss shortly).

## Why is one great password not enough?

As you've seen, it's safe to assume that some of your data has already been stolen or leaked. If you use the same password across more than one service or website, an attacker can reuse that stolen password to access more of your accounts and data.

If you use different passwords for each of your accounts, and one password for one account is stolen, only that account is in danger. You'll then need to reset only one password to resecure the account. Compare that with having to change a reused password for many different accounts each time there's a data breach. You can see why having unique passwords can save you time.

But how do you remember a different password for every account? What if you have dozens or hundreds of accounts? How can you safely protect all those passwords? Here are a couple of good options:

- Write them in a notebook and store the notebook in a safe. This is secure because hackers usually can't physically access your safe and open it.
- Use a password manager. This is secure because password managers are designed solely to store passwords. A password manager can be opened only with a key (the secret password or passphrase) that's known only to the person who owns it. Password managers are also convenient, so they're more likely to be used.

Because storing a notebook of passwords in a safe isn't convenient, a password manager is the better option for most people who use a computer and/or smartphone. A password manager is your safest option if you treat it carefully. In this case, *carefully* means that you should:

- Use a passphrase instead of a short password.
- Use *multifactor authentication* to secure it even further.

We'll explain multifactor authentication later in this training.

## What's even better than a password?

What's a *passphrase*, and how is it different from a password?

In the past, the recommendation for a strong password was to use eight characters. The characters had to include at least one uppercase character, number, and special character such as `!`, `:`, `@`, `*`, `$`, or `#`. This guidance resulted in passwords that were easy for a hacker to crack and hard for people to remember. People tended to create the simplest passwords possible that met all of those rules. To make matters worse, people often reused those weak passwords for other accounts.

One famous example is the password *Pa$$w0rd*. It meets all of the criteria, yet it's high on the list of the 1,000 most commonly used passwords. Hackers also have access to other password lists (for example, the 1,000,000 most commonly used passwords) that they simply plug into their password-cracking software.

If you think you have a password that has never been used, you should know that tools exist to launch a *brute force* attack. This type of attack tries every combination of all characters to guess a password. Computers are good at guessing quickly, so don't assume that your password can never be guessed.

> [!TIP]
> Any password or passphrase that you use should be at least 15 characters long. This number is easy to reach with a passphrase, especially if you use five words.

## Creating a secure and complex password/passphrase

What's better than any short, complicated password? A long, complicated password. Unfortunately, those tend to be difficult to type and hard to remember.

Another approach is easier to both type and remember: a *passphrase*. A passphrase is several randomly chosen words used instead of a complex password. A classic example is "correct horse battery staple," immortalized in the web comic [XKCD #936](https://xkcd.com/936/?azure-portal=true).

That comic example shows how it's much easier for a computer to guess a short, complicated-looking password than a longer set of easy-to-remember words. You can see that the passphrase words are much easier to remember than something long and complicated.

How can you make your own passphrase? One easy way is to pick any four words from objects in the room around you. Then add a fifth word, anywhere in the middle, that represents something unique to you. You've created a fantastic passphrase.

Take for example: *speaker card recyclable antenna sheetrock*. If you use a passphrase like that (be sure to create your own and don't reuse this example) to secure your password manager, you'll be safe. If you add another word or a combination of numbers or other characters, you'll be even better off. If you know any words in different language, you can also add one of those.

After you've made a passphrase with your own words and are ready to make sure all of your accounts have different, complicated passwords or passphrases, what's next? How can you conveniently keep track of them all, while still being secure?

## Password managers to the rescue!

In the past decade, *password managers* have improved to make it easy and convenient for you to keep your accounts secure without having to memorize all your passwords. A password manager is a program that locks up all of your passwords until you need them, similar to a safe.

You can access your passwords by using your one easy-to-remember and hard-to-crack passphrase. Password managers also encrypt your data, so the data is unusable to anyone who doesn't have the key to *decrypt* (unlock) it.

First, you'll need to find a trusted password manager. Here are four common, convenient, and highly rated password managers. They work in all browsers, on Windows, macOS, and most smartphones.

- 1Password
- LastPass
- Dashlane
- Bitwarden

All of these except 1Password have free plans that you can use indefinitely. At the time of this writing, 1Password has a free trial for 14 days only.

To test any of these password managers, download the program to your computer or smartphone and give it a try. You should be able to use all except 1Password for free, without a credit card. Most of them have additional features available for a fee.

You should also consider installing your password manager's *browser extension* (the program that runs in your internet browser). These extensions make signing in online while using that browser much more convenient, while still being secure.

## After you've installed a password manager, what's next?

Now that you have a password manager, you should change any basic or reused passwords to make sure they're complex (long, with much variety). Also make sure that you're not using them for more than one account each. While you're making updates, this is a great opportunity to change all your passwords and add those accounts to your password manager.

Some password managers will generate long and complex passwords for you as you make changes. Good password managers will also record new entries or updates for you automatically, so you won't have to enter that information twice.

With your accounts and passwords now stored securely, you'll be able to view and manage sign-in information from just one place. You can add and store other confidential information like addresses, credit card numbers, or your passport number.

Now things will be more convenient. For example, when you visit a website, your password manager can automatically fill in the username and password for you. As long as you unlock your vault with your passphrase, you can sign in to your other accounts automatically afterward. If you're concerned about someone else using your password manager if you step away from your computer, you can set your password manager to automatically lock itself after an amount of time that you set.

:::image type="content" source="../media/3-password-manager.svg" alt-text="Diagram showing a user's password manager that has access to multiple accounts, protected by a single key sign-in.":::

When you're done using your online accounts, you can close or lock the password manager. This will make sure your passwords are unavailable to anyone else with whom you might share a computer.

> [!TIP]
> You don't have to put *every* password or passphrase in your password manager. You can keep some of them in your head, or written on a piece of paper that stays in a safe or lockbox. Just make sure that every password or passphrase that you use is long and difficult to crack.

## More reasons to use a password manager

One of the best things about password managers is that you can have your data securely synchronized across multiple devices. For example, if you update a password on your laptop, it will also be updated in your phone app. When you sign in to that updated account by using your phone, it will use the updated password.

If you're worried about whether the data is stored securely, you should also know that no one can access the data stored in the password managers that we recommended earlier without knowing your passphrase. Even the companies that make those recommended password managers don't know what your passphrase is. This is by design. Because nobody else can know, you can be much more secure.

> [!TIP]
> You really don't want to be locked out of your password manager, especially because you now have passwords that aren't reused and that are long and varied. If you aren't sure if you can remember your new passphrase, you should write it on a piece of paper and store it somewhere safe. After you're sure you can remember your passphrase, you can destroy the piece of paper. In the meantime, you have a backup plan for accessing your passwords.

Password managers can also allow you to share just one or a few of your passwords with family members without having to share your main passphrase. You can even provide an emergency-access option to a trusted family member for all of the secured information if you want a backup plan.

Password managers are convenient, secure, and simple to use. They'll do most of the hard work for you. You'll have to add your accounts, but only once. After that, all you need to remember is your single passphrase to get access to all of your passwords.
