Staying secure online is a challenge. The internet and the devices connected to it are constantly changing. Unfortunately, criminals are changing their tactics too. They're constantly taking advantage of flaws wherever they can find them.

Think about the internet as a neighborhood where you do common tasks such as email, banking, or shopping. Then think about who your neighbors are. Some of these neighbors are dangerous. They include:

- Organized crime gangs intent on stealing personal account information.
- Hackers who will use your computer to attack other victims.
- Automated downloads that install ransomware to keep you from using your computer until you pay (or until you restore from a backup).
- Government-backed hackers who might be on a mission to steal intellectual property or destabilize governments.

Most of your online activity probably doesn't directly expose you to crime. But odds are good that you know someone who's been a victim of some kind of computer-related crime, like computer viruses, malware, identity theft, or data breaches. If it hasn't happened to you and if you don't protect yourself, it's just a matter of time before you'll be directly affected. What can you do to keep yourself safe, without having to be a cybersecurity expert?
