We'll continue enhancing our serverless web application by creating an instance of the Azure Computer Vision API so that we can use machine learning to analyze images that are uploaded via the site.

In this tutorial, you will:
    - Learn about the Azure Computer Vision API
    - Create an instance of the Azure Computer Vision API

At the end of the tutorial, you will also have the ability to check your knowledge about this information with a quiz challenge.
