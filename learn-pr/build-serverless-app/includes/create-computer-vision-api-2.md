## Overview of Azure Computer Vision API

The cloud-based Computer Vision API provides you with access to advanced algorithms for processing images and returning information. By uploading an image or specifying an image URL, Microsoft Computer Vision algorithms can analyze visual content in a variety of ways, based on inputs and user choices. 

You can use the Computer Vision API to:
* Tag images based on content.
* Categorize images.
* Identify the type and quality of images.
* Detect human faces and return their coordinates.
* Recognize domain-specific content.
* Generate descriptions of the content.
* Use optical character recognition to identify printed text found in images.
* Recognize handwritten text.
* Distinguish color schemes.
* Flag adult content.
* Crop photos to be used as thumbnails.

To get started, create an instance of the Computer Vision API so that you can configure it later to process your images.
