The serverless solution that you're building will use three Azure Functions. One of the Functions will be used by Event Grid for new pictures that are uploaded and send them over to be processed by the computer vision API. The other two will back the APIs that the website uses, to upload images and retrieve the list of images.

In this tutorial, you will:
- Learn about Azure Functions
- Create Azure Functions
- Hook your serverless app to your new Functions

At the end of the tutorial, you will also have the ability to check your knowledge about this information with a quiz challenge.
