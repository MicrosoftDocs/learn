Event Grid connects data sources and event handlers. In this tutorial, we're going to use Event Grid to instantly trigger our Azure functions to run image analysis each time a new photo is added to our Storage container (when it was uploaded from the website).

In this tutorial, you will:
    - Learn about Azure EventGrid
    - Setup EventGrid to process images that are uploaded to your website

At the end of the tutorial, you will also have the ability to check your knowledge about this information with a quiz challenge.
