Django provides a SQLite database by default and by completing this module we have found out how easy it was to create and deploy. We also defined the app models for our database and discovered why adding the `__str__` method to our model classes was beneficial. Finally, we learned when creating a project Django automatically creates an API to interact with the SQLite database. By opening the Python shell we can then use Django commands to easily modify the database. 

In this module you learned:

- The concepts of an ORM
- How to create a SQLite database in Django
- How to create and activate Django models
- The purpose of the `__str__` method in classes
- How to create and query data in your database
