With the understanding of Django templates, you now have the ability to create consistent pages and single points of modification with template inheritance while also developing dynamic pages with the tags and variables that are available within the templating language. By combining this understanding with generic views, it provides a simplistic way to display the contents of a database while allowing you to quickly move on to the next task.

In this module you learned how to:

- work with views
- use template variables and tags
- add dynamic data to Django templates
- use template inheritance
