When first beginning to create websites having static pages seems only natural, but what if you wanted to get a little creative and have data change per user or per page? That's where using templates can ease the process of developing apps. Templates give us the option to use the same page multiple times throughout the site, with sections of data that can continuously change depending on the request. In this module learn why it is worth the time to create dynamic pages and how to easily create and manage them.
