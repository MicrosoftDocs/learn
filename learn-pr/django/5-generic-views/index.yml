title: Use generic views in Django
summary: Because Django was designed for data-driven applications, it includes numerous built-in utilities to streamline the amount of code needed. One key area where Django makes a developer's life easier is by providing generic views, which are pre-built with all the necessary code to perform core operations like displaying and editing data. We will see how we can use generic views to greatly reduce the amount of code required.
