  questions:
    - content: Using the help system, what command, or function, helps you paginate the response?
      choices:
        - content: "`command --help`"
          explanation: Incorrect.
          isCorrect: false
        - content: "`Get-Help command`"
          explanation: The command `Get-Help` is what you use to find out more about a command. However, the function `help` offers a better experience because it paginates the response and lets you traverse it row by row.
          isCorrect: false
        - content: "`help command`"
          explanation: Correct. By using `help`, you pipe `Get-Help` into a function so that you can see the help page. You can see it row by row and line by line if you want.
          isCorrect: true
    - content: Which statement will most efficiently find the returned type from a command?
      choices:
        - content: "`command --type`"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect.
        - content: "`command | Get-Member`"
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: Correct. The cmdlet `Get-Member` lists the returned type at the top of the response. 
        - content: "`command | Get-Type`"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect.
        - content: "`command Get-Member`"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. The command needs to be piped with `Get-Member`.
