  questions:
    - content: What's a correct way to locate a command in PowerShell?
      choices:
        - content: "Call `Get-Command 'name of command'`"
          explanation: Correct. That's the correct way to locate a command.
          isCorrect: true
        - content: "Call `Find 'name of command'`"
          explanation: Incorrect. There's no `Find` command in PowerShell.
          isCorrect: false
        - content: "Call `Locate 'name of command'`"
          explanation: Incorrect. There's no `Locate` command in PowerShell.
          isCorrect: false
    - content: How would you search for commands that deal with files?
      choices:
        - content: "Call `Get-Command -Verb File*`"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. The word `file` is a noun, so you need to search by using the parameter `-Noun`.
        - content: "Call `Get-Command -Noun File`"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. Although this command searches for commands in which the noun part is `file`, it's using an exact match, so you risk not seeing a command like `Get-FileHash` in the output. 
        - content: "Call `Get-Command -Noun File*`"
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: Correct. This command correctly searches by using the `-Noun` parameter because `file` is a noun. It uses an asterisk (`*`) to ensure it finds all commands that have the word `file` in them.
