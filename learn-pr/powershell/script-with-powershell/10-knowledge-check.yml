  questions:
    - content: Which file extension is correct for a script? 
      choices:
        - content: .pm1
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. It should be .ps1.
        - content: .ps
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. It should be .ps1.
        - content: .ps1
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: Correct! 
    - content: What's the correct way to declare a required parameter?
      choices:
        - content: "Add this decorator: `[Required]`."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. There's no `Required` decorator.
        - content: "Add this decorator: `[Parameter(Mandatory)]`."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "`Parameter` is the correct decorator. `Mandatory` is the correct value. You can also type it like this: `[Parameter(Mandatory=$true)]`" 
        - content: You can't. You need to verify that parameter values are set.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. You can use the `Parameter` decorator and the `Mandatory` value.
    - content: How can you cause a terminating error?
      choices:
        - content: Use the keyword `Throw` followed by a string or object.
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: That's correct.
        - content: 'Create a new instance of the class `Error`, like this: `new Error("error message")`'
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: That's not how you do it.
        - content: 'Use the common parameter `ErrorAction`, like this: `-ErrorAction Error`'
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: You can use an `-ErrorAction` to cause an error, but it needs to have the `Stop` argument. `Error` isn't a valid argument.
