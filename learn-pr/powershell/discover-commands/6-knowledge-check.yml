  questions:
    - content: Using the help system, what command or function helps you paginate the response?
      choices:
        - content: "`'command' -help`"
          explanation: Incorrect. Using the `-help` function with a command doesn't help you paginate the response.
          isCorrect: false
        - content: "`Get-Help 'command'`"
          explanation: Incorrect. `Get-Help` is the cmdlet you use to find out more about a command. However, adding the `-help` function offers a better experience because it paginates the response, so you can traverse it row by row.
          isCorrect: false
        - content: "`help 'command'`"
          explanation: Correct. By using `help`, you pipe the `Get-Help` cmdlet into a function so that you can see the help page. You can see it row by row and line by line, if you want.
          isCorrect: true
    - content: Which statement will most efficiently find the returned type from a command?
      choices:
        - content: "`'command' -type`"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. You don't use the `-type` function to find the returned type from a command.
        - content: "`'command' | Get-Member`"
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: Correct. The  `Get-Member` cmdlet lists the returned type at the top of the response. 
        - content: "`'command' | Get-Type`"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. `Get-Type` is not the cmdlet to use to find the returned type from a command.
        - content: "`'command' Get-Member`"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. The command needs to be piped with the `Get-Member` cmdlet.
