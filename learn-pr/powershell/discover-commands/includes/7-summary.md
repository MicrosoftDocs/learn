In this module, you learned how to inspect a command that you intend to use. Looking at a command before you use it helps you call the command correctly and learn the different ways you can call the command. 

You also looked at inspecting what a command returns. PowerShell commands return objects. By calling `Get-Member`, you learn what type of object will be returned and the object's properties. With that information, you can look for related commands that operate on same object type.

You'll learn how to use object type information in later modules that look at pipelines and combining multiple commands in a single command.
