quiz:
  questions:
    - content: How would you find all members of a response starting with "F"?
      choices:
        - content: "`Get-Process 'name of process' | Get-Member -Name F*`"
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct. This solution is how you search for members starting with F."
        - content: "`Get-Process 'name of process' | Get-Member -Name F`"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. This solution won't work as it only searches for a member with the exact name F."
        - content: "`Get-Process 'name of process' | Get-Members -Name F*`"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. Get-Member is the correct command to pipe to."
    - content: What will this command answer with `Get-Process 'some process' | Format-Table Name, CPU | Select-Object Name, CPU`"?
      choices:
        - content: The Name and CPU for the process in question.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. The use of Format-Table before Select-Object transforms the response to another type of object so values for Name and CPU are no longer found where they used to be.
        - content: Empty response
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: Correct. The Format-Table command will transform the response so that Name and CPU values still exist, but in other columns.
        - content: It will throw an error
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. It will not throw an error, but it will show an empty response as the Format-Table has transformed the object and the data is no longer found in the Name and CPU columns.
    - content: Which statement is the best choice for _filtering left_?
      choices:
        - content: "`Get-Process | Select-Object Name | Where-Object Name -eq 'name-of-process'`"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. In this statement, the filtering happens late (that is, at the _right side_ of the statement). Filtering late is slow and inefficient, especially if the command is sent over the network and the data store is large.
        - content: "`Get-Process | Where-Object Name -eq name-of-process | Select-Object name-of-process`"
          explanation: Almost. In this statement, filtering happens early (that is, toward the _left side_ of the statement). But the statement would be faster if it uses a built-in filter in the left-most cmdlet.
          isCorrect: false
        - content: "`Get-Process -Name name-of-process | Select-Object Name`"
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: Correct. This solution is the best choice. The statement filters early and uses a built-in filter.
