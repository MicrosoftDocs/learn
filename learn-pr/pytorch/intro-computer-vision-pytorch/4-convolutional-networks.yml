  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
    - content: "What is a convolution layer?"
      choices:
        - content: "A special activation function for images"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Convolution layer is a small window that runs over the image to extract patterns"
        - content: "An image preprocessing layer that normalizes and prepares image before the dense layer"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Convolution layer is a small window that runs over the image to extract patterns"
        - content: "A layer that runs a small windows across the image to extract patterns"
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct"
    - content: "How do the number of parameters in a convolutional layer and dense layer correlate?"
      choices:
        - content: "A convolutional layer contains more parameters"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "A convolutional layer contains small filters that have the same weights for the whole image"
        - content: "A convolutional layer contains less parameters"
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct, a convolutional layer contains small filters that have the same weights for the whole image"
    - content: "If the size of an input image is **3x200x200**, what would be the size of the tensor after applying a 5x5 convolutional layer with 16 filters?"
      choices:
        - content: "16x196x196"
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "This is correct"
        - content: "3x196x196"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "First dimension should correspond to the number of filters"
        - content: "16x3x200x200"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Color dimension goes away after applying filters. Also, do not forget that sliding window reduces the spatial dimension."
        - content: "48x200x200"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Color dimension goes away after applying filters. Also, do not forget that sliding window reduces the spatial dimension."
