  title: Train multi-layer convolutional neural network
  description: In this unit, we learn how several convolutional layers can be stacked in order to recognize hierarchy of patterns that build up objects on the image.

  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
    - content: "Which layers do we apply to significantly reduce spatial dimension in multi-layered CNN?"
      choices:
        - content: "Convolution"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Convolution layer only slightly reduces the dimension of the image"
        - content: "Flatten"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Flatten is used to reshape spatial tensor into a linear vector"
        - content: "MaxPooling"
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Pooling layers (such as MaxPooling or AveragePooling) are used to decrease the dimension, usually by a factor of 2"
    - content: "Which layer is used between convolutional base of the network and final linear classifier?"
      choices:
        - content: "Convolution"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Convolution layers are used in convolutional base"
        - content: "Flatten"
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Flatten is used to reshape spatial tensor into a linear vector"
        - content: "MaxPooling"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Pooling layers are often used to reduce the dimension in between convolutional layers"
        - content: "Sigmoid"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Sigmoid is usually used after the final layer to get the probability output"
