  title: Use a pre-trained network with transfer learning
  description: Transfer Learning allows you to use a CNN pre-trained on a large standard dataset, and adapt it for your specific task, reaching high accuracy with much lower training efforts and smaller dataset.

  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
    - content: "For transfer learning, we are using a VGG-16 network pre-trained on 1000 classes. What is the number of classes we can have in our network?"
      choices:
        - content: "Any"
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Number of classes in pre-trained network is not important since we are training our own final classifier"
        - content: "1000"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Number of classes in pre-trained network is not important since we are training our own final classifier"
        - content: "2"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Number of classes in pre-trained network is not important since we are training our own final classifier"
        - content: "less than 1000"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Number of classes in pre-trained network is not important since we are training our own final classifier"
