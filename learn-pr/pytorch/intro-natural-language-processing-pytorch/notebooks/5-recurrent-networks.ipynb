    "In the previous module, we have been using rich **_semantic representations of text_**, and a simple linear classifier on top of the embeddings. What this architecture does is to capture aggregated meaning of words in a sentence, but it does not take into account the **order** of words, because aggregation operation on top of embeddings removed this information from the original text. Because these models are unable to model word ordering, they cannot solve more complex or ambiguous tasks such as text generation or question answering.\n",
    "\n",
    "To capture the meaning of text sequence, we need to use another neural network architecture, which is called a **recurrent neural network**, or RNN. In RNN, we pass our sentence through the network one word vector from a news article sequence at a time, and the network produces some **state**, which we then pass to the network again with the next one word vector from the sequence.  RNN storing a \"memory\" of the previous in the state, helps the network understand the **_context of the sentence_** to be able to predict the network word in the sequence.\n",

    "- Given the input sequence of word vectors $X_0,\\dots,X_n$, RNN creates a sequence of neural network blocks, and trains this sequence end-to-end using back propagation. \n",
    "- Each network block takes a pair $(X_i,h_i)$ as an input, and produces $h_{i+1}$ as a result. \n",
    "- Final state $h_n$ or output $y$ goes into a linear classifier to produce the result. \n",
    "- All network blocks share the same weights, and are trained end-to-end using one backpropagation pass.\n",
    "\n",
    "The hidden cell containing the current and prior state is calculated with the following formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $h(t) = {tanh(W_{h}h_{t-1} + W_{x}x_{t} + B_{h}) }$ \n",
    "- $y(t) = {  W_{y}h_{t} + B_{y} }$ \n",
    "- Formula for calculating ${tanh}$ -  $f(x) = {\\frac{e^{x} - e^{-x}}{e^{x} + e^{-x}}} $\n",
    "\n",
    "At each network block, weights $W_{x}$ are applied to the numeric word vector input value; applying the previous hidden state $W_{h}$; and the  final state $W_{y}$. The ${tanh}$ activation function is applied to the hidden layer to produce values between $[-1,1]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because state vectors $h_0,\\dots,h_n$ are passed through the network, it is able to learn the sequential dependencies between words. For example, when the word **_not_** appears somewhere in the sequence, it can learn to negate certain elements within the state vector, resulting in negation.  \n",

    "## Long Short Term Memory (LSTM)\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the main problems of classical RNNs is the so-called **vanishing gradients** problem. Because RNNs are trained end-to-end in one back-propagation pass, it is having hard times propagating error to the first layers of the network, and thus the network cannot learn relationships between distant tokens. The gradient helps in adjusting the weights during back-progagation to achieve better accuracy and reduce the error margin.  If the weights are too small the network does not learn.  Since the gradient decreases during back-propagation in RNNs, the network does not learn the initial inputs in the network.  In other ways, the network \"forgets\" the earlier word inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the ways to avoid this problem is to introduce **explicit state management** by using so called **gates**. There are two most known architectures of this kind: **Long Short Term Memory** (LSTM) and **Gated Relay Unit** (GRU).\n",

    "* **forget gate** takes hidden vector and determines, which components of the vector $c$ we need to forget, and which to pass through. The gate determines which words are not important and sigmod values close to zero need to be thrown out.  The formula is $f_t = \\sigma(W_f  * [x_t + h_{t-1}] + b_f)$.\n",
    "* **input gate** takes some information from the input and hidden vector, and inserts it into state. The formula for the input gate is a product of the new information $i_t = \\sigma(W_i  * [x_t + h_{t-1}] + b_f)$ and the hidden  $\\tilde{C_t} = \\tanh(W_f  * [x_t + h_{t-1}] + b_f)$\n",
    "* **output gate** transforms state via some linear layer with `tanh` activation, then selects some of its components using hidden vector $h_i$ to produce new state $c_{i+1}$.  The formula for the input gate is $o_t = \\sigma(W_o  * [x_t + h_{t-1}] + b_f)$ and the hidden is ${h_t} = {o_t} * \\tanh(C_t) $\n",

For example, when we encounter a name *'Alice'* in the sequence, we may want to assume that it refers to female character, and raise the flag in the state that we have female noun in the sentence. When we further encounter phrases *and Tom*, we will raise the flag that we have plural noun. Thus by manipulating state we can supposedly keep track of grammatical properties of sentence parts.\n",

    "\n",
    "In our example, we had to pad all sequences in the minibatch with zero vectors. While it results in some memory waste, with RNNs it is more critical that additional RNN cells are created for the padded input items, which take part in training, yet do not carry any important input information. It would be much better to train RNN only to the actual sequence size.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do that, a special format of padded sequence storage is introduced in PyTorch. Suppose we have input padded minibatch which looks like this:\n",
    "```\n",
    "[[1,2,3,4,5],\n",
    " [6,7,8,0,0],\n",
    " [9,0,0,0,0]]\n",
    "```\n",
    "Here 0 represents padded values, and the actual length vector of input sequences is `[5,3,1]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to effectively train RNN with padded sequence, we want to begin training first group of RNN cells with large minibatch (`[1,6,9]`), but then end processing of third sequence, and continue training with shorted minibatches (`[2,7]`, `[3,8]`), and so on. Thus, packed sequence is represented as one vector - in our case `[1,6,9,2,7,3,8,4,5]`, and length vector (`[5,3,1]`), from which we can easily reconstruct the original padded minibatch.\n",
    "\n",
    "To produce packed sequence, we can use `torch.nn.utils.rnn.pack_padded_sequence` function. All recurrent layers, including RNN, LSTM and GRU, support packed sequences as input, and produce packed output, which can be decoded using `torch.nn.utils.rnn.pad_packed_sequence`.\n",

However, since in many practical cases we have random access to the input sequence, it might make sense to run recurrent computation in both directions. Such networks are call **bidirectional** RNNs, and they can be created by passing `bidirectional=True` parameter to RNN/LSTM/GRU constructor.\n",

As with convolutional networks, we can build another recurrent layer on top of the first one to capture higher level patterns, build from low-level patterns extracted by the first layer. This leads us to the notion of **multi-layer RNN**, which consists of two or more recurrent networks, where output of the previous layer is passed to the next layer as input.\n",
