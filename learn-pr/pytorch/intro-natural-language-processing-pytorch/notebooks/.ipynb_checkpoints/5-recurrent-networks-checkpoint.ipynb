What this architecture does is to capture aggregated meaning of words in a sentence, but it does not take into account the **order** of words, because aggregation operation on top of embeddings removed this information from the original text. Because these models are unable to model word ordering, they cannot solve more complex or ambiguous tasks such as text generation or question answering.\n",
    "\n",
    "To capture the meaning of text sequence, we need to use another neural network architecture, which is called a **recurrent neural network**, or RNN. In RNN, we pass our sentence through the network one word vector from a news article sequence at a time, and the network produces some **state**, which we then pass to the network again with the next one word vector from the sequence.  RNN storing a \"memory\" of the previous in the state, helps the network understand the **_context of the sentence_** to be able to predict the network word in the sequence.\n",

    "One of the main problems of classical RNNs is so-called **vanishing gradients** problem. Because RNNs are trained end-to-end in one back-propagation pass, it is having hard times propagating error to the first layers of the network, and thus the network cannot learn relationships between distant tokens. The gradient helps in adjusting the weights during back-progagation to achieve better accuracy and reduce the error margin.  If the weights are too small the network does not learn.  Since the gradient decreases during back-propagation in RNNs, the network does not learn the initial inputs in the network.  In other ways, the network \"forgets\" the earlier word inputs.\n",

    "* **input gate** takes some information from the input and hidden vector, and inserts it into state. $i_t = \\sigma(W_f  * [x_t + h_{t-1}] + b_f)$.   $\\tilde{C_t} = \\tanh(W_f  * [x_t + h_{t-1}] + b_f)$\n",

When we further encounter phrases *and Tom*, we will raise the flag that we have plural noun. Thus by manipulating state we can supposedly keep track of grammatical properties of sentence parts.\n",
