  title: Represent words with embeddings
  description: Embeddings are a way to represent words using some vector representation that has nice semantic properties. We discuss different embeddings, and how using embeddings can improve classification accuracy.

    - content: |
        Suppose your text corpus contains 80000 different words. What is typically done to reduce the dimensionality of input vector to neural classifier?
      choices:
        - content: "Randomly select 10% of the words and ignore the rest"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "It's definitely not a good idea, especially because you risk omitting semantically important words"
        - content: "Use convolutional layer before fully connected classifier layer"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Convolutional layers don't reduce the dimensionality of input vectors"
        - content: "Use embedding layer before fully connected classifier layer"
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "That's correct"
        - content: "Select 10% of most frequently used words and ignore the rest"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "While ignoring some words might be a good way to limit vocabulary, leaving most frequently used words isn't a good idea because they're often not semantically important"
