       Recurrent neural network is called recurrent, because:
      choices:
        - content: "A network is applied for each input element, and output from the previous application is passed to the next one"
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "This is correct."
        - content: "It is trained by a recurrent process"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Recurrent neural network is trained in the same manner as any other neural network"
        - content: "It consists of layers which include other subnetworks"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "While you can consider recurrent block to be a combination of two linear layers, it has nothing to do with recurrence"
