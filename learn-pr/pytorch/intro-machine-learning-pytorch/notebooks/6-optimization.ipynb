    "You may have noticed that the model is initially not very good (that's OK!). Try running the loop for more `epochs` or adjusting the `learning_rate` to a bigger number. It might also be the case that the model configuration we chose might not be the optimal one for this kind of problem (it isn't). Later courses will delve more into the model shapes that work for vision problems.\n"
