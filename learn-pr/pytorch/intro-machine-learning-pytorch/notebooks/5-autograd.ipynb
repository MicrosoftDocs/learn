    "## Automatic differentiation with ``torch.autograd``\n",
    "\n",
    "When training neural networks, the most frequently used algorithm is **back propagation**. In this algorithm, parameters (model weights) are adjusted according to the **gradient** of the loss function with respect to the given parameter. The loss function calulates the difference between the expected output and the actual output that a neural network produces. The goal is to get the result of the loss function as close to zero as possible. The algorithm traverses backwards through the neural network to adjust the weights and bias to retrain the model. That's why it's called back propagation. This back and forward process of retraining the model over time to reduce the loss to 0 is called the gradient descent.\n",
