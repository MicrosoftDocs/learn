  title: Load data with PyTorch Datasets and DataLoaders
  description: Code for processing data samples can get messy and hard to maintain; we ideally want our dataset code to be decoupled from our model training code for better readability and modularity.

  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
    - content: "What is the difference between a PyTorch `DataSet` and a PyTorch `DataLoader`"
      choices:
        - content: "A `DataSet` is designed to work with _batches_ of data while a `DataLoader` is designed for retrieval of _individual_ data items."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "A `DataSet` is designed for retrieval of _individual_ data items while a `DataLoader` is designed to work with _batches_ of data."
        - content: "A `DataSet` is designed for retrieval of _individual_ data items while a `DataLoader` is designed to work with _batches_ of data."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct, a `DataSet` is designed for retrieval of _individual_ data items while a `DataLoader` is designed to work with _batches_ of data."
        - content: "The `DataLoader` class is the parent of the `DataSet` class"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "A `DataSet` is designed for retrieval of _individual_ data items while a `DataLoader` is designed to work with _batches_ of data."
