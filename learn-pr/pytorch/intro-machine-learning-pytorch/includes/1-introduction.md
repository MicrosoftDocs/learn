Most machine learning workflows involve working with data, creating models, using hyperparameters to optimize models, saving and then inferencing the trained models. This module introduces you to a complete machine learning (ML) workflow implemented in PyTorch, a popular ML framework for Python. 

We use the FashionMNIST dataset to train a neural network model that recognizes images such as: T-shirt/top, Trouser, Pullover, Dress, Coat, Sandal, Shirt, Sneaker, Bag, or Ankle boot.

Before we jump into building the model, we show you the key concepts for building Neural Network models.
