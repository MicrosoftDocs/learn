Infrastructure as code is the process of provisioning infrastructure resources similar to how software is deployed. These resources include virtual machines, virtual networks, and web applications. Infrastructure as code can help automate your deployments, increase confidence in your deployments, and increase efficiency and repeatability.

## Example scenario

Suppose you work as an Azure infrastructure administrator at a toy company that's experiencing significant growth in the global market. As a result, your infrastructure needs to scale with the company’s growth, including:

- Deployments of new applications for internal teams and customers.
- Multi-regional deployments to support your customers and partners around the world.
- Multi-environment deployments to ensure consistency.

You've been asked to evaluate whether infrastructure as code might be a valuable approach to resource provisioning at your company. You also need to decide which technology to use when you deploy your Azure infrastructure.

## What will you be doing?

In this module, you'll learn about the concept of infrastructure as code and its benefits. You'll understand the purpose of Bicep as an infrastructure as code language and understand how it works. You'll find answers to these questions:

- What is infrastructure as code?
- How can infrastructure as code help you automate resource provisioning?
- What is Bicep and how does it work?
- When should you use Bicep instead of other tooling options?

## What is the main goal?

After completing this module, you'll be able to determine whether infrastructure as code is the right approach and tool for your organization.

## Prerequisites

- You should be familiar with basic cloud computing concepts and terminology.
- You should be familiar with different types of cloud resources.
