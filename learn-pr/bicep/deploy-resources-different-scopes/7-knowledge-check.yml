  questions:
  - content: |
      You need to create a role definition that will work throughout your whole organization.
      You decide to deploy it using a Bicep template.
      Which `targetScope` value should you use for the file?
    choices:
    - content: "`targetScope = 'tenant'`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: |
        Role definitions can't be created at the tenant scope.
        Since you want to use the role definition throughout your whole organization, you could consider deploying it to the root management group instead.
    - content: "`targetScope = 'managementGroup'`"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: |
        You should deploy the role definition to the root management group, so that it is inherited by all of your Azure resources throughout your organization.
        Role definitions can't be created at the tenant scope.
    - content: "`targetScope = 'subscription'`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: |
        Although you can deploy role definitions at a subscription scope, they won't be available to your whole organization.
  - content: |
      Which of these statements is true?
    choices:
    - content: You can deploy a management group from any scope.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: |
        Management groups are a tenant-scoped resource.
        You can use Bicep files that have a `targetScope` other than `tenant`, but you'll need to explicitly set the `scope` to `tenant()`.
    - content: Management groups must be deployed at the `tenant` scope.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: |
        Management groups are a tenant-scoped resource.
        You can use Bicep files that have a `targetScope` other than `tenant`, but you'll need to explicitly set the `scope` to `tenant()`.
    - content: Management groups must be deployed in the scope of a parent management group.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: |
        Management groups are a tenant-scoped resource.
        You can use Bicep files that have a `targetScope` of `managementGroup`, but you'll need to explicitly set the `scope` to `tenant()`.
        Also, the hierarchy of management groups doesn't depend on how they're deployed.
        You set a management group's parent as one of its properties.
  - content: |
      You have written a Bicep file that includes this line:<br />
      `targetScope = 'managementGroup'`<br />
      Which of these statements is true?
    choices:
    - content: The file can be used as a module within a template that deploys at management group scope.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: | 
        Bicep files that target a management group can include modules that are set to use the `managementGroup` target scope.
    - content: The file can be used as a module within a template that deploys at subscription scope.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: |
        Bicep files that target a subscription can't include modules that are set to use the `managementGroup` target scope.
    - content: The file can be used as a module within a template that deploys at resource group scope.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: |
        Bicep files that target a resource group can't include modules that are set to use the `managementGroup` target scope.
