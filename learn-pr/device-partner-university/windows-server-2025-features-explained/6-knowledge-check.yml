  questions:
  - content: "What does secured-core server in Windows Server 2025 primarily protect against?"
    choices:
        - content: "Network-based attacks"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. Secured-core focuses on deeper system layers."
        - content: "Firmware-level attacks"
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct. It guards against threats invisible to traditional tools."
        - content: "Application vulnerabilities"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. These are addressed by other security measures."
        - content: "Physical theft"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. Secured-core does not prevent physical access."
  - content: "What is a key benefit of rebootless updates via Azure Arc?"
    choices:
        - content: "They eliminate the need for security patches"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. Patches are still applied."
        - content: "They require manual server restarts"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. Rebootless updates avoid restarts."
        - content: "They reduce downtime during patching"
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct. Updates are applied without disrupting workloads."
        - content: "They only work on physical servers"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. They apply to Azure Arcâ€“enabled servers."
  - content: "How does GPU partitioning improve AI and ML workload efficiency?"
    choices:
        - content: "By disabling unused GPU cores"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. Partitioning allocates resources, not disables them."
        - content: "By assigning one GPU per VM"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. It avoids dedicating full GPUs to each VM."
        - content: "By dividing a GPU into multiple virtual GPUs"
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct. This enables efficient resource sharing."
        - content: "By replacing GPUs with CPUs"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. CPUs are not a substitute for GPU-intensive tasks."
  - content: "What does Azure Arc enable for Windows Server 2025 management?"
    choices:
        - content: "Isolated server environments"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. Azure Arc centralizes, not isolates."
        - content: "Manual patching only"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. It supports automated patching."
        - content: "Unified management across environments"
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct. It integrates on-premises, edge, and cloud."
        - content: "Exclusive cloud-only control"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. Azure Arc supports hybrid environments."
  - content: "What distinguishes Hyper-V containers from Windows containers?"
    choices:
        - content: "They use less memory"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. Isolation, not memory usage, is the key difference."
        - content: "They share the OS with other containers"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. That describes Windows containers."
        - content: "They run in a more isolated environment"
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct. Hyper-V containers offer added security."
        - content: "They require physical servers"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. They can run on virtual infrastructure."
