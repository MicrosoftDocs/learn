Cybersecurity threats are more advanced and persistent than ever, and downtime from a single breach can have lasting financial and reputational consequences. Windows Server 2025 introduces new tools that help IT professionals secure workloads and reduce risk while maintaining business continuity.  

## How to safeguard infrastructure with secured-core server

[Secured-core server](/windows-server/security/secured-core-server) builds protection into the hardware, firmware, and operating system. By enabling secured-core features, IT teams can:  

- Guard against firmware-level attacks that are often invisible to traditional security tools.  
- Protect sensitive data with virtualization-based security (VBS).  
- Apply stronger identity protections for remote and hybrid workers.  

> [!TIP]
> Try it yourself: Use Windows Admin Center to enable secured-core features on a test VM. Explore how virtualization-based security changes system behavior.

Secured-core capabilities can be configured during deployment or enabled on supported hardware using Windows Admin Center. Together, these security and resiliency features form a strong foundation for your infrastructure. Once your environment is protected, the next step is to expand its capabilities. Let’s look at how Windows Server 2025 helps you extend cloud innovation to on-premises workloads.

## How to apply rebootless updates with Azure Arc

Unpatched systems are a common entry point for attackers, but applying updates often requires downtime. Windows Server 2025 supports rebootless updates for servers connected through [Azure Arc](/azure/azure-arc/servers/cloud-native/overview). 

With rebootless updates, IT teams can:  

- Apply critical security patches without disrupting workloads.  
- Reduce maintenance windows and keep systems resilient.  
- Improve overall uptime while still meeting compliance requirements.  

> [!NOTE]
> Rebootless updates are available as an add-on service for Azure Arc–enabled servers.  

## How to secure identity and access

Identity remains a top attack vector. Windows Server 2025 expands Active Directory and related tools to strengthen authentication and authorization. IT professionals can:  

- Enforce multifactor authentication for privileged access.  
- Monitor sign-in attempts for suspicious activity.  
- Securely enable remote access for hybrid workers.  

By combining these protections, organizations can reduce the likelihood of credential theft and safeguard sensitive resources.
