Microsoft Surface Laptop for Business (Intel) is a Copilot+ PC built by Microsoft that is designed specifically for business users. Combining software, hardware, AI features, and multiple connectivity options, Surface Laptop for Business (Intel) allows business users to complete routine tasks faster—enabling them to achieve their goals with the latest generation of hardware and software advancements.

## Hardware

Image that you're a business user that needs a device that balances performance, portability, and connectivity to get your work done. Surface Laptop for Business (Intel) offers hardware that fits these needs. Let's look at some of the device specifications that solve this need without added complexity:

- **Intel® Core™ Ultra 5 (236V, 238V) and Ultra 7 (266V, 268V) processors:** Surface Laptop for Business (Intel) is powered by the Intel® Core™ Ultra (Series 2) family of processors. These processors are designed to offer powerful performance in slimmer lighter devices like Surface Laptop for Business (Intel). Manufactured in a modern 3-nanometer process, this series of processors have an emphasis on efficiency. It features eight cores that run at 2.2 GHz by default but can boost up to 5 GHz for more intense workloads. Ultra (Series 2) processors also feature an NPU (Neural Processing Unit) that's capable of up to 48 TOPS (Trillions of Operations per Second) for AI-based performance.
- **Anti-reflective display:** Surface Laptop for Business (Intel) comes in two different screen sizes: 13.8" and 15". Both sizes feature a 3:2 aspect ration that allows for more vertical content to be displayed in web pages and Microsoft Office applications.  ****They both also feature anti-reflective technology, which reduces the amount of light bouncing off the display because of a thin coating that minimizes reflections. For business users that are on the go, this helps to improve readability, enhanced color perception, and meets standards to ensure the health and safety of workers. Surface Laptop for Business (Intel) has been certified by TÜV SÜD to meet the requirements of ISO 9241-307 regarding the ergonomics of human-system interaction for electronic visual displays.
- **Ports and charging:** Both size configurations of Surface Laptop for Business (Intel) feature two USB-C/USB4 ports with support for charging, data transfer, DisplayPort 2.1, and Surface Thunderbolt 4 Dock. They also feature one USB-A 3.1 Gen 2 port, a 3.5-mm headphone port, and Surface Connect Port. The device supports fast charging with a minimum of 65-W power supply via the Surface Connect port or USB-C.

>[!NOTE]
> The Surface Laptop for Business 15" model also has a MicroSDXC Express card reader for removable storage.

- **5G connectivity:** Surface Laptop for Business (Intel) also has the option of 5G connectivity—ensuring that business users can get work done regardless of their location. The device has multiple antennas that are placed strategically within the chassis—dynamically switching based on how and where the laptop is being used. The palm rest on the 5G model is made from a composite that's optimized for antenna performance. Connectivity on the 5G model supports both a physical Nano SIM and digital eSIM—ensuring seamless connection regardless of the users' mobile network provider.

- **Smart Card Reader:** On the 15" model only, Surface Laptop for Business (Intel) offers business users enhanced security and risk mitigation. By adding a physical layer of security in addition to a PIN, the Smart Card Reader minimizes the risk of unauthorized access—protecting against sophisticated cyber threats, including phishing and social engineering attacks. The Smart Card Reader on Surface Laptop for Business (Intel) is engineered to comply with industry standards such as Common Access Card (CAC) and Personal Identity Verification (PIV) Card, which are used by various federal agencies.

## Software

In our scenario, you're a business user that places a focus on performance. On-device Copilot+ PC AI features on Surface Laptop for Business (Intel) help to accomplish tasks faster.

- **Click to Do:** This feature identifies text and images on your screen, analyzes them, and provides actionable options that you can select based on the content. Click to Do identifies only the presence of text and images—not their actual content—and performs all processing locally on the device.
- **Windows Studio Effects:** For those that are on video calls often, this feature helps to optimize video effects while on camera and can be turned on through quick settings. These can frame the subject to be centered, optimize lighting in poorly lit environments, and simulate eye contact.
- **Recall (preview):** Enabling you to quickly find and jump back into what you have seen before on your PC, Recall (preview) is a powerful productivity tool that provides an explorable timeline to find content you previously had opened. Using semantically powered search, describe how you remember something that was open and Recall (preview) will retrieve the moment you saw it. Recall (preview) can find photos, files, links, or messages as a fresh point to start from.

## Security

Business users handle sensitive data daily, making security one of the most important features of a new device. Surface Laptop for Business (Intel) delivers chip-to-cloud security and offers multiple layers of protection to keep their information safe.

- **Secured-core PC:** Windows integrates closely with Surface hardware to deliver protections that take advantage of hardware capabilities. As a Secured-core PC, Surface Laptop for Business (Intel) uses TPM 2.0 (Trusted Platform Module 2.0) for a hardware root of trust, secure boot, and BitLocker drive encryption. This hardware provides protection that's useful against sophisticated attacks and can provide increased assurance when handling mission-critical data in data-sensitive industries.
- **Microsoft Pluton:** Surface Laptop for Business (Intel) features the Microsoft Pluton security processor—a hardware-based security chip that's integrated directly into the CPU (Central Processing Unit). Microsoft Pluton provides hardware-based root of trust, secure identity, secure attestation, and cryptographic services. Pluton technology is a combination of a secure subsystem, which is part of the System on Chip (SoC), and Microsoft-authored software that runs on this integrated secure subsystem.
- **Device Firmware Configuration Interface (DFCI):** Designed to be used with software-level mobile device management (MDM), DFCI enables IT admins to remotely disable specific hardware components and prevent end users from accessing them. For example, if you need to protect sensitive information in highly secure areas, you can disable the camera, and if you don't want users booting from USB drives, you can disable that as well.
- **Windows Autopilot:** Deploying Surface Laptop for Business (Intel) is simplified with Windows Autopilot. This feature simplifies the Windows device lifecycle, for both IT and end users—from initial deployment to end of life. Autopilot streamlines IT deployment processes, minimizes infrastructure maintenance requirements, and enhances usability for end users.
