## Recall (preview)

Imagine you are working on an important presentation. You remember stumbling across a chart that would be great for a slide, but you forgot where you saw it. In the past, this meant digging through your browser history in the hopes of finding the right page.

With Recall (preview) on Surface Laptop for Business (Intel), you can use an explorable timeline to find the content you remember seeing before. Using semantic powered search, simply describe how you remember something, and Recall (preview) will retrieve the moment you saw it. Any photo, link, or message can be a fresh point to continue from.

Recall (preview) does not share snapshots or associated data with Microsoft or third parties, nor is it shared between different Windows users on the same device.

If you opt into using Recall (preview), then as you use your PC, a snapshot of your active screen will be saved every few seconds and when the content of your active window changes. Snapshots are also protected with Windows Hello, so that only the signed in user can access their Recall (preview) content.

> Every time you launch Recall (preview) or change Recall (preview) settings, you'll be asked to confirm that it's you by using Windows Hello. Your saved snapshots and any associated information are encrypted so that only you can access them.

Once you've confirmed your identity, you're taken to your Recall (preview) homepage. As you use your Surface Laptop for Business (Intel), your homepage will tailor itself to you based on your recent snapshots and apps you used.

If you'd prefer not to have a customized homepage, you can turn the feature off and simply only have a search bar. Here's how to turn this feature off:

- Open **Settings**
- Select **Privacy & security**
- Then select **Recall & snapshots**
- Then **Advanced settings**
- Click **Off** under *Recall shows a customized experience using your snapshots*

To review your previous snapshots, select the timeline from Recall's (preview) navigation bar. Your timeline in Recall (preview) is broken into segments, which are the blocks of time that snapshots of your screen are taken while you were using your Surface Laptop for Business (Intel). You can hover over your timeline to review your activity in a preview window. Selecting the location on the timeline or selecting the preview window loads the snapshot where you can interact with the content.

When searching with Recall (preview), the results will be listed under the headings of **text matches** and **visual matches**. Matches that are closer to your search are shown first. You'll also notice that some items are listed as one of the following types of matches:

- **Close match:** Close matches typically include at least one of the search terms or images that are representative of a term in your query.
- **Related match:** Matches that share a commonality with the search terms would be considered related.
