## How Copilot Chat summarizes emails

When you ask Copilot Chat to summarize a thread:

- It identifies the main points and decisions in the conversation.

- It highlights action items you're responsible for.

- It can create a concise summary suitable for forwarding or referencing later.

## Best practices for summarizing email threads

Keep these tips in mind when using Copilot Chat in Outlook:

- **Verify critical details**: Confirm dates, names, and assignments in the summary before taking action.

- **Use the summary to plan next steps**: Turn action items into tasks or schedule meetings directly from the summary.

- **Share when needed**: Forward the summary to teammates to keep everyone aligned without sending the full thread.

> [!TIP]
> You can ask Copilot Chat to highlight action items specifically by typing: *"List my follow-up tasks from this email thread."* This helps you prioritize what needs immediate attention.
