Microsoft Outlook helps you manage your email and schedule efficiently. But a full inbox of project updates, client questions, and meeting invites can quickly become overwhelming. Without the right tools, it’s easy to miss deadlines or lose track of important messages.

Imagine starting your day with dozens of unread emails spread across multiple threads. You spend valuable time scrolling, trying to understand decisions made and actions required. The longer it takes to catch up, the more likely you're to fall behind or respond late.

Outlook provides features to organize and prioritize your inbox so you can focus on what matters. With Copilot Chat, you can take this further—summarizing long conversations, highlighting key points, and drafting professional replies in seconds. Together, these tools save time, reduce errors, and help you stay in control of your workday.

By the end of this module, you’ll be able to summarize emails, draft and rewrite messages, and manage your inbox and calendar efficiently using Copilot Chat in Outlook.
