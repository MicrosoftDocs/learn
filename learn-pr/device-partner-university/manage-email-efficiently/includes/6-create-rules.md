Microsoft Outlook allows you to create rules that automatically organize incoming emails, such as moving them into folders or flagging them for follow-up. Instead of setting up these rules manually, you can now use Copilot Chat to do the work for you.

With Copilot, you describe the action you want taken and the condition that should trigger it. For example:

   - **Action**: Move messages into a project folder.

   - **Condition**: All emails from your manager.

Copilot then creates the rule for you, shows you a preview, and asks for confirmation before saving it. You also get a direct link to the Rules settings in Outlook in case you want to edit or refine the rule later.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If Copilot can't create rules directly, it gives you step-by-step guidance to set up the rule manually.

## Why use Copilot for rules?

- *Saves time*: No need to manually navigate Outlook’s rule settings.

- *Easy to customize*: Just describe what you want in plain language.

- *Keeps you in control*: Copilot confirms the rule and points you to where you can manage it once it's created.

> [!TIP]
> You can make rules as simple or detailed as you like. For example, try asking:
>
> *“Move all emails from [Person] to my Project Alpha folder and flag them for follow-up.”*
>
> Going forward, every new email from [Person] will skip your main inbox, land in Project Alpha, and show up flagged in your follow-up view—all automatically.
