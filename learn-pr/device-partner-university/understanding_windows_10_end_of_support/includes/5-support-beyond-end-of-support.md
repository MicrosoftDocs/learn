Windows 10 reaches end of support soon—but you aren’t left without options.

Microsoft offers paths to stay protected while you plan your move to Windows 11.

### Extended Security Updates (ESUs) for Windows 10

If you need more time to modernize, paid [Extended Security Updates](/windows/whats-new/extended-security-updates) (ESUs) provide critical security patches for Windows 10 beyond end of support.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> However, ESUs are temporary. Costs double each year, and you miss out on the innovation and performance of Windows 11.

### Microsoft 365 Apps on Windows 10

To help maintain productivity during the transition, [Microsoft 365 Apps](/microsoft-365-apps/end-of-support/windows-10-support) will continue to receive security updates on Windows 10 through **October 14, 2028**—for the apps only, not the operating system.

This gives you more time to upgrade your devices while keeping your core productivity tools secure.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> End of Support marks the end of the Windows 10 lifecycle. While ESUs and app support offer short-term relief, they’re not replacements for the security, performance, and AI innovation that come with Windows 11.
