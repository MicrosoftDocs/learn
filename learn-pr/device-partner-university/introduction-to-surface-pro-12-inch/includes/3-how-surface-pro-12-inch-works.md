Surface Pro 12-inch is a Copilot+ PC that is ideal for AI productivity use cases, flexible work, and portability. Let's get familiar with the hardware of Surface Pro 12-inch before you turn it on for the first time.

## Ports and powering on

Let's start on the right side of the device. You will see two USB-C ports. These ports handle charging in addition to connecting peripherals—such as monitors, portable hard drives, and docking stations. When first booting up Surface Pro 12-inch, it's recommended to run through the initial setup with the device plugged in. On the top left corner of the device, you will see a power button. This button serves a dual purpose: to power the device and to lock the screen while your Surface Pro 12-inch is powered on.

On the front of the device, you will see the Full HD front-facing Surface Studio Camera. This webcam has support for Windows Studio Effects with automatic framing, portrait blur, creative filters, eye contact, and portrait light. This will be the primary way that you capture video for virtual meetings through apps such as Microsoft Teams.

Next to the Surface Studio Camera is a secondary Windows Hello camera. This sensor enables Surface Pro 12-inch to support secure sign-in authentication via facial recognition using Windows Hello for Business with Enhanced Sign-in Security. When set up, your Surface Pro 12-inch will scan your face and securely sign into your Surface Pro when you press the power button.

After powering Surface Pro 12-inch, it's easy to configure your settings and be ready to work in moments. Start by selecting your language, then connecting to your local network. Once the basics are set up, log in to your Microsoft Account. Doing this allows you to sync files and data across devices. Logging in to your account will also automatically sign you into native applications like Microsoft Edge.

After your account is synchronized, you will have the option to set up biometric unlocking through Windows Hello to keep your device secure, importing settings from previous devices with your Microsoft Account backup, and finally setting up privacy settings. And now your Surface Pro 12-inch is ready to be used.

To set up Windows Hello follow these steps:

- Open **Settings**
- Then select **Accounts**
- Choose **Sign-in options**
- Select **Facial recognition (Windows Hello)**
- **Set up**
- Follow on-screen instructions to register facial scan data

Lastly, on the back of the device you will see the Surface Slim Pen storage slot. This is where you can store your Surface Slim Pen 2nd Edition (sold separately) allowing it to be docked when not in use. To the right of this slot, you will see the 10MP Ultra HD rear-facing camera. This camera is capable of capturing video in 4K resolution.
