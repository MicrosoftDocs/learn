Microsoft cloud-based management and security tools enable IT professionals in education to centralize and streamline security operations across endpoints using unified administrative dashboards.

These solutions support alignment with cybersecurity insurance requirements by adhering to privacy regulations and international cloud privacy standards. Additionally, deployment and implementation support can facilitate a more efficient transition to cloud-based infrastructure.

## Microsoft Security Copilot

Microsoft Security Copilot and Microsoft Purview Data Loss Prevention provide IT professionals with tools to enhance threat detection and protect sensitive data across Microsoft 365 environments.

Security Copilot assists IT teams by aggregating and summarizing large volumes of security signals into actionable insights. It offers AI-driven guidance across identities, devices, data, cloud services, and applications. Automated workflows and agent-based processes help accelerate incident response and reduce manual overhead.

## Microsoft Purview Data Loss Prevention

Microsoft Purview Data Loss Prevention (part of the Microsoft Purview suite) enables administrators to control the sharing, transfer, and use of sensitive information through machine learning-based classification, policy enforcement, and analytics. These controls are designed to maintain data security without significantly impacting user productivity. The solution is cloud-native and supports scalable deployment and management.

## Microsoft Intune for Education

Microsoft Intune for Education is a cloud-based mobile device management (MDM) solution designed for K–12 institutions. It enables IT administrators to manage devices, applications, and data access across school environments while maintaining security and compliance.

With Intune for Education, IT teams can:

- Manage student devices remotely
- Configure and assign classroom applications
- Control access to data and manage sharing permissions
- Enforce institutional security policies

## Microsoft Entra ID

Microsoft Entra ID, included with Microsoft 365 Education subscriptions, provides identity and access management for Microsoft cloud services.

IT administrators can manage user identities for faculty and students, assign licenses to users and devices, and create groups for classroom management. These capabilities support oversight and protection of the institution’s digital environment.

## Microsoft Sentinel

Microsoft Sentinel is a scalable, cloud-native security information and event management (SIEM) solution that supports threat detection, investigation, response, and automation across hybrid environments.

It collects and correlates data from users, devices, applications, and infrastructure—both on-premises and across multiple cloud platforms. IT administrators can use built-in AI capabilities to investigate threats and identify suspicious activity at scale, leveraging Microsoft’s threat intelligence and analytics.

Microsoft Sentinel also helps reduce false positives and uncover previously undetected threats. Security orchestration is supported through automated workflows and playbooks that integrate with Azure services and non-Microsoft tools, streamlining incident response and operational efficiency.

## School Data Sync

School Data Sync (SDS) is a free service for educational institutions that automates the synchronization of user and roster information from student information systems (SIS) into Microsoft 365.

With SDS, IT administrators can centrally manage users, classes, and roles, keeping data automatically updated in Microsoft Entra ID and Microsoft 365. It supports integration with Microsoft Teams, Intune for Education, Exchange Online, SharePoint Online, OneNote Class Notebooks, and other applications through single sign-on (SSO).

These capabilities help reduce manual administrative tasks and minimize errors, improving overall reliability and efficiency. This allows IT teams to focus on strategic initiatives such as enhancing security, deploying new features, and providing direct support.
