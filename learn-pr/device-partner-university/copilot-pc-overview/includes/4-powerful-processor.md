You might be wondering why NPUs are so important. Let’s examine a concrete example.

This video represents how an NPU, GPU, and a CPU perform the same task. An AI was asked to identify faces in a video feed and count every face it saw.

As you can see, all the chips can do this work—but the NPU does it far more effectively. Not only is the task completed faster with an NPU, but the process generates far less heat and uses much less energy.

## Data-driven focal points

AI is already helping Copilot+ PC users work smarter. With high performance and advanced features, these devices bring real innovation and support the way business gets done. 

### Potential for AI in workplaces

People spend more than half their day (57%) communicating in meetings, email, and chat, with only 43% dedicated to creating. In fact, since 2020, the amount of time that people spend in meetings has tripled.<sup>5</sup>

Many people struggle with these distractions, as 68% say they don’t have enough uninterrupted focus time during the day. Indeed, 64% of employees state they have a difficult time managing work tasks due to lack of energy and time.<sup>5</sup>

These challenges contribute to what is commonly called "brain-drain," where people are 3.5X more likely to struggle with innovation and strategic thinking—hindering their organizations’ ability to generate profits, adapt, and compete.<sup>5</sup>

The message is clear—employees want to simplify their workday so they can focus on contributing more to their organizations, and many are already thinking about how AI can help:

- **80%** of employees would like AI to summarize their meetings, action items, and plan their day.<sup>5</sup>

- **86%** of employees want AI to help them find the right answers and information.<sup>5</sup>

- **73%** would be comfortable using AI for creative work.<sup>5</sup>

Industries worldwide rely on Microsoft innovations in AI to transform, solve problems, and seize new opportunities.

Now, organizations of any size can benefit from devices uniquely designed for AI and high-octane performance.

Copilot+ PCs can bring powerful, intelligent edge computing to work experiences—helping to accelerate innovation, solve problems faster, and drive business growth.

As the pace and complexity of work increase, many are exploring how AI can help simplify daily tasks and improve focus. Recent insights show strong interest in AI tools that can:

- Summarize meetings, track action items, and assist with planning.
- Quickly surface accurate information.
- Support creative processes and idea generation.

## Windows 10 end of service
