The Copilot key represents the first major change to the standard PC keyboard since the introduction of the Windows key nearly 30 years ago.

When pressed, the Copilot key invokes Copilot in Windows—making it easier than ever to integrate AI into the workday.

## Four key areas of emphasis

### Performance

Accelerate success with a turbocharged NPU, for an unmatched experience with lightning speed, smooth performance, and richer AI.

Unlike the NPUs found in other Windows 11 PCs, Copilot+ PCs feature NPUs capable of a minimum of 40 TOPS—making them up to five times faster than the most popular five-year-old Windows PCs still in use today.<sup>3</sup>

### Productivity 

With unique AI experiences, you can uncover new opportunities, solve problems faster, and create compelling content.

Copilot+ PCs are designed to help you get more done with less work. For instance, you can find something you’ve seen on your Copilot+ PC faster than ever using Recall ([preview](https://support.microsoft.com/windows/retrace-your-steps-with-recall-aa03f8a0-a78b-4b3e-b0a1-2eb8ac48701c)). Copilot+ PCs also have the fastest implementation of Microsoft 365 apps.

### Security

Copilot+ PCs safeguard your most sensitive information.

Like all Windows 11 Pro devices, Copilot+ PCs are designed to be secure from the moment they're powered on. All Copilot+ PCs are Secured-core PCs and include a Microsoft Pluton security coprocessor—providing extra protection for sensitive data.

### Readiness

Copilot+ PCs put AI and blazing performance at your service, so your team can respond to business needs with speed, agility, and innovation.

Organizations with Copilot+ PCs are on the forefront of AI innovation with the best power to performance efficiency of any Windows PC and incredible, all day battery life.<sup>4</sup>
