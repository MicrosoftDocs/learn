          explanation: "Incorrect. Cloud-based Copilot is available on Windows 11 Pro PCs, not exclusive to Copilot+ PCs."
        - content: "They feature a supercharged NPU capable of 40+ TOPS"
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct. Copilot+ PCs have NPUs with 40+ TOPS, offering the fastest performance."
        - content: "They lack a Copilot key"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. Copilot+ PCs include a Copilot key for easy access to AI features."
        - content: "They don't support AI-enabled apps"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. Copilot+ PCs support a wide range of AI-enabled apps."
  - content: "What does TOPS measure in the context of NPUs?"
    choices:
        - content: "The number of AI models supported"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. TOPS doesn't measure model support."
        - content: "The total maximum achievable throughput"
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct. TOPS measures the processing capability of an NPU."
