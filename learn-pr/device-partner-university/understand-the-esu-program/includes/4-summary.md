In this module, you learned how the Extended Security Updates (ESU) program helps organizations maintain security on Windows 10 devices, so IT teams have more time to complete the transition to Windows 11. 

We briefly summarized what ESUs are and identified when an organization can benefit from the program. We also explained the cost of implementation and how it increases each year.
