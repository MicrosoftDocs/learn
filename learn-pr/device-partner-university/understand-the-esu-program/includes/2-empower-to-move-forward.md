With Windows 10 reaching its end of support on **October 14, 2025**, organizations must prepare for the transition to Windows 11 or explore temporary solutions to maintain security compliance.

The Extended Security Updates (ESU) program offers a bridge for businesses that need additional time to complete their migration while ensuring their devices remain protected.

The ESU program can help businesses:

- Maintain security compliance while planning their transition

- Avoid operational disruptions caused by running unsupported software

- Gain extra time to upgrade apps and infrastructure before moving to Windows 11

The ESU program provides essential security updates for Windows 10 after its EOS date, but it does NOT replace the need to upgrade!

Businesses that enroll in the ESU program must still transition to Windows 11. Remember, the ESU program is a temporary fix, not a long-term solution.

You might be wondering — why can’t organizations just rely on the ESU program indefinitely? Well, the ESU program is only available for up to three years, or until October 14, 2028, at the latest.

At that point, organizations will need to be fully transitioned to Windows 11 to ensure ongoing security and system stability.

Keep in mind, the ESU program includes only critical and important security updates—no new features, performance improvements, or non-security updates.

By not upgrading to Windows 11, organizations will miss out on the latest features and capabilities, putting themselves at a competitive disadvantage.
