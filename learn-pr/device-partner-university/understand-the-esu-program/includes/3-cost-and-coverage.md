**Virtual machines:** The ESU program is available at no extra cost for Windows 10 virtual machines running in Windows 365 or Azure Virtual Desktop.

**Windows 365 Cloud PCs:** Windows 10 endpoints connecting to Windows 365 Cloud PCs are entitled to the ESU program for up to three years with an active Windows 365 subscription license.

**Individuals or Windows 10 Home:** For individuals or Windows 10 Home customers, the Windows 10 ESU program will be available for purchase at USD30 for one year only.

## Other program details

*Can ESUs be purchased for a specific duration?*

The ESU program is sold on a yearly basis. That means you can't buy partial periods, like say, only six months.

Year One starts in November 2025. If you wait until Year Two to enroll, you'll have to pay for both Year One and Year Two, since ESUs are cumulative.

*When is the ESU program available for licensing?*

The Windows 10 ESU program is available through volume licensing, meaning you can purchase it right now. Itâ€™s available for those using Windows 10 Enterprise, Education, and Professional editions.

*Is technical support included in ESU?*

No, technical support for Windows 10 isn't included in the ESU program. However, Microsoft provides support for organizations that encounter challenges related to the ESU program specifically.

*Will Windows 10 PCs still work?*

Windows 10 PCs will continue to work, but you should upgrade eligible devices to Windows 11 using Windows Autopatch or Microsoft Intune. For the best and most secure experience, you should transition to new Windows 11 PCs as soon as possible.

Another option is migrating to the cloud and subscribing to Windows 365. This option allows employees to access Windows 11 on any device via a Cloud PC.
