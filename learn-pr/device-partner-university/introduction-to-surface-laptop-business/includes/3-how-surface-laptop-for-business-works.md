Adaptive touch mode allows users with varying mobility and dexterity levels to customize the touchpad to better suit their personal needs. Here's how to turn on this feature:

- Open the **Surface App** on your Surface Laptop for Business.
- Select your keyboard shown at the bottom of the app and then from the list on the right, select **Touchpad settings**.
- Enable Adaptive touch by toggling the switch to On and then selecting "Turn on".

> If you don't have the Surface app installed, you can download it from the Microsoft Store. When it's downloaded, select Start, search for Surface, then select the app from the list of results.

With adaptive touch mode enabled, the touchpad reacts to inputs from different parts of your body. You can adjust its settings to match your specific needs. For example, you can:

- Modify the size of the right-click region.
- Change the time interval between clicks needed to register a double click.
- Use various parts of your body—such as your palm, foot, hand edges, or even residual limbs—to interact with the touchpad.
