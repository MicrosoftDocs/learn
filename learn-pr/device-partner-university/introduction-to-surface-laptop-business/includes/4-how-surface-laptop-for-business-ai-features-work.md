Live Captions is an accessibility feature that helps users understand audio by providing automatic transcription. With the NPU (Neural Processing Unit) on Surface Laptop for Business, any audio that passes through the device is transcribed instantly. This works for both live and pre-recorded video in any app or video platform from over 40 languages into English. There are multiple ways to turn on this feature on your Surface Laptop for Business:

- **Using quick settings**: Turn on Live Captions in the quick settings.

>[!NOTE]
> To open quick settings, select the battery, network, or volume icon on the taskbar.

- **Using quick settings Accessibility flyout:** Turn on the Live Captions toggle in the quick settings Accessibility flyout.
- **Using keyboard shortcut:** Press Windows logo key + Ctrl + L.
- **Using Start menu:** Select Start > All apps > Accessibility > Live Captions.
- **Using settings menu:** Go to Settings > Accessibility > Captions and turn on the Live Captions toggle.

When you turn on Live Captions for the first time, you'll be asked for your consent to process voice data on the device. You'll then be prompted to download language files to be used by on-device speech recognition.

## Improved Windows Search

:::image type="content" border="true" source="../media/improved-windows-search.gif" alt-text="Animation of Improved Windows Search feature on Microsoft Surface Laptop for Business.":::

On Surface Laptop for Business, finding files is simplified, ensuring that time isn't wasted looking for the files that you need. By using natural language, you can find the files and settings that you need without needing to remember the full file name. This feature uses on-device AI to scan your files and find what you are looking for quickly and efficiently.

Improved Windows Search is built into the following places on your Surface Laptop for Business:

- File Explorer
- Windows Search box in the taskbar
- Settings app

To initiate a search, simply click on the search box and begin typing what you are looking for. Because it uses AI to understand your intent, it doesn't require exact file name matches, perfect phrasing, or even correct spelling. For example, if you were looking for a file that was named "Q2_financial_review.pptx," you could type something as simple as "budget deck" and it would find the file.

Improved Windows search will index and support your searches automatically. You can manage what is indexed and included using the following steps:

1. Go to **Settings**.
2. Select **Privacy & Security**.
3. Click on **Searching Windows** to adjust which locations are indexed on your Surface.
4. Turn on **Enhanced** to index your entire PC.

>[!NOTE]
> It's recommended that you plug in your Surface Laptop for Business for the initial search indexing to get completed, since the process can be taxing to the battery.

This feature is optimized for six languages:

- Chinese (simplified)
- English
- French
- German
- Japanese
- Spanish

And it supports the most common file types for documents (.txt, .pdf, .docx, .doc, .rtf, .pptx, .ppt, .xls, .xlsx) and images (.jpg/.jpeg, .png, .gif, .bmp, .ico)
