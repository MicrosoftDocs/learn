Microsoft Surface Laptop for Business is a Copilot+ PC built by Microsoft that is designed specifically for business users. Combining software, hardware, and AI features, Surface Laptop for Business allows business users to complete routine tasks faster—enabling them to achieve their goals with the latest generation of hardware and software advancements.

## Hardware

Imagine that you're a business owner that needs a device that balances performance and portability to get your work done. Surface Laptop for Business offers hardware that fits these needs. Let's look at some of the device specifications that solve this need without adding complexity:

- **Qualcomm Snapdragon X Plus (10 core) X1P64100 and X Elite (12 core) X1E80100 processors:** There are two different processor choices available with Surface Laptop for Business. The Snapdragon X Plus offers 10 cores running at 3.4 GHz with a Neural Processing Unit (NPU) capable of 45 TOPS (trillions of operations per second). For more performance, there's also the option for the Snapdragon X Elite processor, which offers 12 cores running at 3.4 GHz with an NPU capable of 45 TOPS. Both of these processors offer high performance with excellent power efficiency—allowing work to be done from anywhere to meet the needs of business users.
- **PixelSense Flow Display:** Surface Laptop for Business comes in two different screen sizes: 13.8" and 15". Both feature a 3:2 aspect ratio that allows more vertical content to be displayed in web pages and Microsoft Office applications, automatically adjusting display refresh rates of 120 Hz, and 10-point multitouch for touch interaction. They both also feature Corning Gorilla Glass 5—ensuring screen durability.
- **Ports and charging:** Both size configurations of Surface Laptop for Business feature two USB-C/USB4 ports with support for charging, data transfer, DisplayPort 1.4a, and Surface Thunderbolt 4 Dock. They also feature one USB-A 3.1 Gen 2 port, a 3.5-mm headphone port, and a Surface Connect Port. The device supports fast charging with a minimum of 65-W power supply via the Surface Connect port or USB-C.

> The Surface Laptop for Business 15" model also has a MicroSDXC Express card reader for removable storage.

- **Haptic touchpad:** Surface Laptop for Business features a precision haptic touchpad that features a mode called Adaptive Touch that allows for precise scrolling with your palm, foot, or residual limb. Navigation and control are made easier with customizations that create tactile cues in the touchpad.

## Software

In our scenario, you're a business owner that places a focus on performance. On-device Copilot+ PC AI features on Surface Laptop for Business help to accomplish tasks faster.

- **Click to Do:** This feature identifies text and images on your screen, analyzes them, and provides actionable options that you can select based on the content. Click to Do identifies only the presence of text and images—not their actual content—and performs all processing locally on the device.
- **Live Captions:** An accessibility feature that translates audio from 44 different languages into English captions. Live Captions can be turned on in Accessibility settings under Captions and works with a wide range of media—including streaming webinars, video calls, and local files.
- **Improved Windows Search:** On Surface Laptop for Business, searching for essential files is now simplified with Improved Windows search. Built into File Explorer, the Windows Search box on the taskbar, and in Settings, Improved Windows Search helps you to find what you are looking for by utilizing natural language terms instead of having to remember the full file name and location. This feature also works for system settings—including adding new devices using everyday language for example "add headphones."

## Security

Business users handle sensitive data daily, making security one of the most important features of a new device. Surface Laptop for Business delivers chip-to-cloud security and offers multiple layers of protection to keep their information safe.

- **Secured-core PC:** Windows integrates closely with Surface hardware to deliver protections that take advantage of hardware capabilities. As a Secured-core PC, Surface Laptop for Business uses TPM 2.0 (Trusted Platform Module 2.0) for hardware root of trust, secure boot, and BitLocker drive encryption. This hardware provides protection that's useful against sophisticated attacks and can provide increased assurance when handling mission-critical data in data-sensitive industries.
- **Microsoft Pluton:** Surface Laptop for Business features the Microsoft Pluton security processor—a hardware-based security chip that's integrated directly into the CPU (Central Processing Unit). Microsoft Pluton provides hardware-based root of trust, secure identity, secure attestation, and cryptographic services. Pluton technology is a combination of a secure subsystem, which is part of the System on Chip (SoC), and Microsoft-authored software that runs on this integrated secure subsystem.
- **Device Firmware Configuration Interface (DFCI):** Designed to be used with software-level mobile device management (MDM), DFCI enables IT admins to remotely disable specific hardware components and prevent end users from accessing them. For example, if you need to protect sensitive information in highly secure areas, you can disable the camera, and if you don't want users booting from USB drives, you can disable that as well.
- **Windows Autopilot:** Deploying Surface Laptop for Business is simplified with Windows Autopilot. This feature simplifies the Windows device lifecycle, for both IT and end users—from initial deployment to end of life. Autopilot streamlines IT deployment processes, minimizes infrastructure maintenance requirements, and enhances usability for end users.
