## Get insights to proactively monitor and manage Surface devices

The **Insights** tab in Surface Management Portal allows you to monitor the health, compliance, and properties of all institution-managed Surface devices. The dashboard displays various insights, each represented by a card. You can pin, rearrange, or expand these cards to view more details. Here are the available insights that you can view as an IT administrator:

- **Devices not compliant:** Displays the number of devices that aren't compliant with your organization's policies—such as missing updates or failing security requirements.
- **Devices inactive 30+ days:** Lists devices that have been inactive for over 30 days.
- **Devices not registered:** Shows devices that haven't been registered in the system.
- **Devices covered:** Displays the number of devices currently covered by warranty support programs.
- **Devices expiring within 60 days:** Identifies devices whose warranty or support coverage expires within 60 days.
- **Devices eligible for optional coverage:** Displays devices that qualify for optional coverage plans but haven't been enrolled.
- **Devices expired:** Lists devices whose warranty or support coverage has expired.
- **Devices not encrypted:** Shows devices without drive encryption enabled, which could pose a security risk.
- **Devices with less than 10% storage:** Displays devices running low on disk space.
- **Devices eligible for Windows 11 update:** Lists devices eligible for an upgrade to Windows 11 but not yet updated.

Surface Management Portal  helps IT administrators manage devices at scale while maintaining visibility into compliance, coverage, and device health across the institution. With these tools, academic institutions have a better understanding of their deployed devices and can keep their faculty and data safe regardless of their preferred workflow.
