Azure Local builds on Windows Server and Hyper-V, providing a familiar foundation for managing its hyperconverged infrastructure. IT administrators can apply existing knowledge and tools—including System Center and Windows Admin Center—to manage virtualized workloads and infrastructure across on-premises and hybrid environments. 

Azure Local also integrates with Active Directory and Group Policy Objects (GPOs) for centralized identity and policy management, and supports non-Microsoft tools such as Altaro, Datadog, Commvault, Veeam, and Veritas for backup, monitoring, and data protection.

## Automation and scripting

Windows PowerShell enables cross-platform command-line management and automation. IT teams can script administrative tasks and deploy infrastructure consistently, supporting efficient lifecycle management of the HCI environment.

## Deployment flexibility

Azure Local offers flexible deployment options to meet different organizational needs:

- **Validated nodes**: Pretested hardware configurations aligned with Microsoft’s reference architecture, ensuring performance and reliability in HCI deployments.

- **Integrated systems**: Delivered with Azure Local software preinstalled, including integrated drivers and firmware for streamlined setup.

### Vendor choice

Azure Local supports a range of hardware vendors, allowing organizations to select solutions based on preferred OEMs, service agreements, and delivery models.

## Scalable infrastructure

Whether deploying a small test environment or a large-scale production cluster, Azure Local supports a wide range of infrastructure sizes. The platform’s modular, software-defined architecture enables organizations to scale resources as needed while maintaining cost efficiency.
