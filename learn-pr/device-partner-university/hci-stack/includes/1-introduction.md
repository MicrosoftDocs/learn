Organizations increasingly run workloads both on-premises and in the cloud. In this module, we explore Azure Local, Microsoftâ€™s hyperconverged infrastructure (HCI) platform. Learn how it simplifies management of virtualized workloads on-premises while integrating with Azure to support hybrid cloud capabilities.

## Learning objectives

By completing this module, you can:

- Learn how hyperconverged infrastructure in Azure Local consolidates compute, storage, and networking to streamline datacenter operations.

- Discover how Azure Arc, Azure Monitor, and other hybrid services support unified management of on-premises and cloud resources.

- Discover scalable deployment options and tools that automate infrastructure management.
