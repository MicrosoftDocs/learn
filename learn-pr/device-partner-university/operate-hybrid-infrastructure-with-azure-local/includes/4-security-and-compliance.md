Security is one of the top priorities for IT, and Azure Local is built with protection in mind at every layer of the stack. Hybrid environments introduce new challenges—data moving across boundaries, workloads running in different locations, and teams managing both cloud and on-premises resources. Azure Local addresses these challenges with an integrated security model that combines hardware-based safeguards, identity-driven access, and compliance tools to help organizations meet regulatory obligations without adding unnecessary complexity.

From encryption and threat detection to role-based access controls and compliance reporting, Azure Local provides a unified security approach that supports both day-to-day operations and long-term governance requirements. Instead of stitching together multiple tools, IT teams can rely on Azure Local to enforce consistent policies, simplify audits, and strengthen resilience against modern threats.

## Core protections

- **Threat detection:** Use Microsoft Defender for Kubernetes on HCI to spot and respond to threats in real time.  
- **Network security:** Segment your environment with software-defined networking (SDN) for microsegmentation and policy enforcement.  
- **Encryption:** Encrypt data at rest and in transit to safeguard sensitive workloads.  
- **Secure hardware:** Take advantage of secured-core server features for advanced firmware and OS-level protection.  

## Identity and access

- Integrate with Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD) for identity-based access.  
- Apply role-based access control (RBAC) consistently across environments.  
- Use conditional access policies for stronger authentication.  

## Compliance alignment

- Track regulatory requirements with Microsoft Compliance Manager.  
- Assess readiness against standards like HIPAA, PCI-DSS, and ISO 27001.  
- Automate evidence collection for audits.  

## Operational security practices

Beyond built-in protections, Azure Local also supports operational security measures that IT teams can implement day to day:  

- **Patch automation:** Use update rings to automatically roll out patches in waves, minimizing disruption.  
- **Log monitoring:** Centralize logs in Azure Monitor or Sentinel for continuous visibility and threat hunting.  
- **Access auditing:** Regularly review role assignments and conditional access policies to ensure least-privilege principles are followed.  

## Real-world example

A government agency uses Azure Local in a secure facility. SDN and Defender for Kubernetes help them meet strict security and audit requirements, while Compliance Manager ensures they stay aligned with national standards. Their IT team also uses patch automation to keep workloads up-to-date and log monitoring to identify suspicious activity in real time.

With security and compliance in place, IT teams can turn attention to financial optimization—ensuring hybrid operations deliver value at the right cost.

## Cost management strategies

IT budgets are tight, and infrastructure decisions need to reflect both technical and financial priorities. Azure Local helps you optimize spending.

### Flexible cost models

- Choose OpEx or CapEx  
- Align with accounting strategies  

### Reduce unnecessary costs

- Automate tasks to reduce overhead  
- Pay-as-you-go billing  
- Unified billing across Azure and Local resources  

### Leverage existing infrastructure

- Use existing SQL Server licenses with Arc-enabled data services  
- Manage on-prem SQL instances in Azure Portal
