You don’t have to learn everything from scratch. Azure Local works with tools you probably already use every day. That means less time spent retraining and more time getting things done. Automation, integration, and a consistent management experience help IT teams focus on innovation rather than repetitive maintenance.

## Tools overview

- **[Windows Admin Center](https://www.microsoft.com/windows-server/windows-admin-center) (WAC):** A visual interface for managing servers, clusters, and workloads. Great for day-to-day tasks like updates and troubleshooting.  
- **[PowerShell](/powershell/scripting/overview):** Automate tasks with scripts—perfect for repeatable actions like provisioning or patching.  
- **[Azure Portal](/azure/azure-portal/azure-portal-overview):** A single place to manage both cloud and local resources, with dashboards, alerts, and access controls.  

Let’s say your team is rolling out a new branch office. With WAC, you can deploy and configure the local infrastructure quickly. Then use PowerShell to automate updates across all locations. And with Azure Portal, you can monitor everything from one place—even if the branch is halfway across the country/region. Automation and centralized visibility reduce the risk of human error and simplify cross-team coordination.

## Unified operations across environments

Managing both on-premises and cloud environments can get messy. Different tools, different processes, and different teams can lead to confusion and errors.

Azure Local helps you standardize operations. You use the same tools and workflows across environments, which means fewer mistakes and faster onboarding for new team members.

### Benefits

- Reduce retraining and simplify patching, monitoring, and deployment  
- Lower risk of operational errors  
- Maintain control over tool selection  
- Apply consistent policies across environments

> Azure Arc lets you manage virtual machines and resources across both local and cloud environments—all from the Azure Portal.

## Streamlined infrastructure

Azure Local is built on three pillars:

1. **Hyperconverged infrastructure** – Combines compute, storage, and networking into one system.  
2. **Azure hybrid service** – Connects your local workloads to Azure for management and visibility.  
3. **Familiar tools** – Uses the same tools IT pros already know and trust.  

This means you can modernize your infrastructure without abandoning your existing skill set. You get the benefits of the cloud while keeping control of your local environment. Streamlined workflows allow IT teams to focus on strategic projects rather than repetitive maintenance.


## Manage virtual machines with Azure Arc

Azure Arc brings cloud-style management to your local infrastructure. You can manage VMs just like you would in Azure—even if they’re running on-premises.

### Features

- Provision and manage Windows/Linux VMs from Azure Portal  
- Consistent experience across environments  
- Role-based access control (RBAC)  
- Self-service provisioning without host access  

> [!TIP]
> Arc-enabled VM management comes with Azure Local—no extra license needed.

A university IT team lets faculty provision VMs for research projects. Azure Arc ensures secure access and consistent policies across departments. With management in place, organizations can focus on growth by scaling workloads to meet new demands efficiently.

## Scaling infrastructure

Azure Local makes it easy to grow your infrastructure when you need to, and scale back when you don’t.

### Considerations

- Run demanding workloads with consistent performance  
- Adjust cluster sizes as needed  
- Use Arc to manage hybrid resources  
- Apply predictive scaling and workload forecasting to avoid over- or under-provisioning  

Imagine a media company scales up during live events, then scales down afterward. Azure Local helps them manage resources efficiently. Using telemetry data, IT teams can forecast demand in advance and pre-allocate resources, ensuring a smoother experience during traffic spikes. Azure Local uses subscription-based billing, so you only pay for what you use.

Scaling adds flexibility, but it also introduces new financial and security considerations. Let’s start with security—built into Azure Local from the ground up.
