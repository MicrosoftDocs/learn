Azure Local’s hybrid capabilities can benefit multiple industries. Let’s explore how real organizations use Azure Local to meet operational, security, and performance needs.

## Retail

Retailers need fast, reliable infrastructure for point-of-sale systems, inventory management, and customer data. Azure Local lets them keep workloads close for speed and security, while still connecting to Azure for management and scaling.

### Needs

- Low-latency infrastructure for transactions  
- Secure environments for customer data  
- Scalable resources for seasonal demand  

### Example

Contoso Retail uses Azure Local to run POS systems in stores. During holiday sales, they scale up resources to handle peak traffic and monitor performance centrally using Azure Monitor. After the busy period, clusters are scaled down to optimize costs. 

**Try it yourself**: Use Azure portal to increase cluster capacity and monitor performance using Azure Monitor Workbooks.

## Healthcare

Healthcare organizations must protect sensitive patient data while enabling fast, reliable access for care providers. Compliance with regulations like HIPAA adds complexity, making hybrid infrastructure an ideal solution.

### Needs

- Local storage for sensitive patient records  
- High-availability systems for critical applications  
- Centralized monitoring and compliance reporting  

### Example

A regional hospital deploys Azure Local to manage electronic health records (EHR) and imaging systems on-premises for compliance. Azure Arc and Azure Monitor provide centralized visibility, while Defender for Kubernetes and SDN policies ensure security. During flu season, additional compute resources are temporarily scaled up to support increased demand for lab and imaging applications.

## Finance

Financial institutions handle large volumes of transactions and sensitive customer data, with strict regulatory requirements. They need hybrid solutions to maintain control while leveraging cloud services for analytics and reporting.

### Needs

- Local processing for high-frequency trading and transactions  
- Secure, auditable storage for customer financial data  
- Scalable resources to support end-of-quarter reporting  

### Example

A mid-sized bank uses Azure Local to run its core banking applications on-premises for performance and regulatory reasons. Azure Arc enables IT teams to provision VMs for temporary analytics workloads, such as end-of-quarter reporting, without impacting production systems. Security is enforced using RBAC and Compliance Manager tracks regulatory alignment.

These examples highlight how Azure Local helps organizations across industries balance performance, compliance, security, and cost efficiency. IT teams can operate consistently while scaling infrastructure to meet real-world demands, using tools and workflows they already know.
