A strong Surface deployment starts long before devices arrive on desks. It begins with understanding how your teams work, the challenges they face, and the tools that help them stay productive and connected. Planning with those needs in mind ensures that every device supports real collaboration—not just day-to-day tasks.

## Understand who you are deploying for

Every team works differently, so identifying your users’ roles and responsibilities is the foundation of a successful deployment.

- **Remote workers** rely on mobility, high-quality video meetings, and long battery life.
- **Hybrid teams** collaborate through shared documents, digital whiteboards, and quick transitions between workspace setups.
- **Frontline staff** need durable, dependable devices that keep up with fast-paced workflows.

When you know what each group depends on to collaborate effectively, you can align device selections and configurations to support their real-world needs.
