Once you’ve selected the right Surface devices for your organization, the next step is deploying and managing them at scale. The Surface Management Portal gives IT admins a centralized way to enroll devices, configure collaboration tools, and monitor device health—all from a single, easy-to-use dashboard. With the portal, you can streamline setup, maintain consistency across teams, and keep devices optimized for productive, secure work.

## What is the Surface Management Portal?

The Surface Management Portal is a web-based tool built to simplify Surface device lifecycle management. It helps IT teams:

- Enroll Surface devices quickly using automated or manual options
- Apply policies that support secure, collaborative work
- Monitor device health, performance, and usage trends remotely

Whether you're deploying a handful of devices or rolling out thousands across distributed teams, the Surface Management Portal offers centralized control that reduces manual work and supports long-term consistency.

## How the Surface Management Portal supports deployment

The Surface Management Portal integrates directly into your deployment workflow, giving IT a structured way to onboard devices and keep them up to date.

### Enroll devices

- Add Surface devices through bulk enrollment, automated provisioning, or manual entry.
- Organize devices by team, department, or location to make policy management simpler and more consistent.

### Apply policies

- Set security policies and baselines to ensure remote and hybrid work environments remain protected.

### Monitor and support
