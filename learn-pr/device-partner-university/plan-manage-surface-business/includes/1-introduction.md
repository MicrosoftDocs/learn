In today’s hybrid workplace, teams need devices that help them stay connected and productive—whether they're brainstorming in a conference room, joining a meeting from home, or collaborating on the go. Microsoft Surface for Business devices are built for exactly that, offering the tools and flexibility organizations need to work smoothly across locations and workstyles.

Imagine rolling out new devices to support a growing team. You need hardware that's easy to deploy, simple to manage, and ready for collaboration from day one. You also want built-in features like high-quality cameras and microphones, inking for creative work, and seamless Microsoft Teams integration—all without adding extra complexity for IT. Managing this manually across dozens or hundreds of devices can quickly become time-consuming without the right structure in place. 

This is where Surface and the Surface Management Portal make a real impact. Surface gives your users a consistent, secure device experience, while the Surface Management Portal helps IT admins plan, configure, and manage devices remotely. Together, they streamline deployment and ensure that every device is set up for teamwork and productivity.

By the end of this module, you know how to plan a Surface deployment that supports collaboration, apply remote management tools to configure devices, and enable features that help teams work more effectively across your organization.
