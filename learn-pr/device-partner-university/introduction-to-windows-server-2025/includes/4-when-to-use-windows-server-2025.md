Windows Server 2025 is designed for organizations that require a secure, scalable, and flexible operating system to support modern workloads. This unit provides guidance for evaluating whether Windows Server 2025 aligns with organizational needs by outlining its capabilities, limitations, and appropriate use cases.

## Windows Server 2025 use cases

Windows Server 2025 is suitable for environments that require:

- **Hybrid cloud integration**
  - Enables management of on-premises servers using Azure tools via Azure Arc.
  - Provides cloud-like operational flexibility without requiring full migration.

- **Enterprise-grade security**
  - Includes advanced security features such as Credential Guard, BitLocker, and Secured-Core Server.
  - Supports centralized identity and access management through Active Directory.

- **Virtualization and scalability**
  - Supports hosting multiple virtual machines (VMs) or containers on a single physical server.
  - Offers nested virtualization and live migration to maintain high availability.

- **Modern management and automation**
  - Facilitates centralized administration using Windows Admin Center.
  - Enables automation through PowerShell and Desired State Configuration (DSC).

- **Resilient storage and networking**
  - Provides fault-tolerant storage using Storage Spaces Direct.
  - Supports dynamic network configuration via software-defined networking (SDN).

- **Support for legacy and modern workloads**
  - Allows upgrades from older Windows Server versions (e.g., Server 2012 R2).
  - Maintains compatibility with both traditional applications and modern services.

## When not to use Windows Server 2025

Alternative solutions may be more appropriate if:

- The environment requires only basic file sharing or simple networking capabilities.
- The organization operates with minimal IT infrastructure, such as in small business settings.
- A fully cloud-native solution is preferred.
- A Linux-based operating system is required.
