## Advanced security and resiliency

Multi-layered security features in Windows Server 2025 are designed to address evolving cybersecurity threats while streamlining administrative management.

### Secured-core Server technology

Windows Server 2025 introduces enhanced hardware security through Secured-core server capabilities. These features are intended to mitigate firmware-level threats, establish a hardware-based root of trust, and prevent the execution of unauthorized code within the operating system. Secured-core functionality utilizes Trusted Platform Module (TPM) 2.0 and System Guard to enable secure boot processes and reduce exposure to firmware vulnerabilities.

### Hybrid deployment enhancements

For environments utilizing both on-premises and Azure deployments, Windows Server 2025 supports hotpatching. This feature enables the application of many security updates without requiring a system reboot, thereby reducing downtime.

Windows Defender Credential Guard employs virtualization-based security to isolate sensitive information, ensuring that only privileged system components can access protected credentials.

### Host intrusion prevention

Windows Defender Exploit Guard provides host intrusion prevention capabilities. These tools help administrators manage and reduce the attack surface of applications commonly used by end users.

### Endpoint protection and response

Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection (ATP) is integrated into Windows Server 2025. It offers access to kernel-level and memory-level sensors, enhancing system performance and resistance to tampering. ATP also supports automated response actions on server endpoints.

### Security baselines and best practices

Windows Server 2025 includes a customized security baseline comprising over 350 configurable security settings. Administrators can apply this baseline and utilize built-in drift control mechanisms to maintain consistent security posture across deployments.

### Virtualization-Based Security (VBS)

VBS enclaves provide isolation for sensitive workloads, separating them from both host applications and other system components. This isolation helps mitigate risks from malicious actors.

VBS also introduces key protection capabilities, enabling cryptographic keys to be safeguarded against theft—even from users with administrative privileges.

### Server Message Block encryption enhancements

Windows Server 2025 supports AES-256-GCM and AES-256-CCM cryptographic suites for Server Message Block (SMB) encryption. AES-128 remains available for compatibility with older systems.

### Intranode storage encryption

To support east-west encryption within failover clusters, Windows Server 2025 enables granular configuration of encryption and signing for intranode communications. This applies to both Cluster Shared Volumes (CSV) and the Storage Bus Layer (SBL).

### Transport Layer Security (TLS)

TLS 1.3 is supported in Windows Server 2025. This version removes deprecated cryptographic algorithms and improves handshake encryption, enhancing overall security compared to earlier TLS versions.

### Authentication and remote access

Web client support for single sign-on (SSO) is available, offering a simplified authentication process for users.

Windows Server 2025 also supports DTLS-based encryption for Remote Desktop Services, enabling secure end-to-end deployment with minimal configuration effort.

## Cloud-ready and flexible with hybrid capabilities

Windows Server 2025 includes a comprehensive set of management tools and hybrid capabilities designed to support both on-premises and cloud-integrated environments through Windows Admin Center and Azure services.

### Windows Server 2025 management capabilities

Windows Server 2025 can be managed using Windows Admin Center, a locally deployed, browser-based toolset designed for both hybrid and on-premises server environments. This toolset is available at no additional cost. Small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) can utilize Windows Admin Center to manage business continuity and disaster recovery operations through integrated hybrid services such as Azure Backup and Azure Site Recovery.

### Azure Hybrid Services integration

For hybrid deployments involving both on-premises infrastructure and Azure, the Azure hybrid services tool within Windows Admin Center consolidates integrated Azure services into a centralized interface. This enables streamlined discovery and configuration of hybrid capabilities.

Azure Monitor is supported for hybrid use cases and can collect telemetry data from physical or virtual Windows Server instances. This data is stored in a Log Analytics workspace, allowing for detailed analysis and correlation.

### Hybrid management features

Windows Server 2025 supports comprehensive management of hybrid server environments, including:

- Storage migration
- System Insights
- Virtual machine protection
- File server synchronization
- Enhanced Active Directory authentication

System Insights provides native predictive analytics capabilities for Windows Server, applicable to both on-premises and hybrid cloud deployments. These analytics deliver high-accuracy forecasts that assist in proactive resource management and cost reduction.

## High performance infrastructure

Windows Server 2025 introduces platform-level enhancements that improve performance, scalability, and manageability across compute, storage, and containerized workloads, with expanded support for modern hardware and hybrid deployment scenarios.

### Platform enhancements in Windows Server 2025

Windows Server 2025 introduces a modern operating system architecture that supports enhanced virtual machine memory, expanded processor and device compatibility, improved congestion control, and updates to encryption and networking capabilities.

Upgrading to Windows Server 2025 with the latest Intel® Xeon® E processors enables support for DDR5 memory and PCIe 5.0 interfaces, offering increased memory bandwidth and improved storage and network performance. These enhancements are particularly beneficial for small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) and entry-level bare metal cloud hosting environments.

### Storage and migration capabilities

Storage Migration Service provides a graphical interface for inventorying and transferring data from Windows, Linux, and NetApp CIFS servers to newer systems or Azure virtual machines.

Windows Server 2025 supports container-based application development, offering improved compatibility with Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). Enhancements to WSL allow Linux users to run scripts using standard tools such as OpenSSH, Curl, and Tar.

Windows containers enable packaging of applications with their dependencies using operating system-level virtualization. This approach provides fast, isolated environments on a single host system.

The Containers extension in Windows Admin Center supports container management tasks, including console access, log inspection, and resource monitoring for containers running on a host.

The Windows Server core container base image has been reduced in size by eliminating duplicate payloads and removing unused optional components.

### Package management and data analytics

Windows Package Manager (Winget) is installed by default, providing command-line tools for managing application installations on Windows systems.

Windows Server 2025 includes enhanced data storage capabilities that support integration with cloud-based analytics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence platforms.

### Software-defined storage and compression

ReFS (Resilient File System) in Windows Server 2025 includes optimized deduplication and compression for active workloads such as virtual machines. These enhancements can reduce storage usage by up to 60% for file servers and up to 90% for VHD, ISO, and backup files.

Storage Replica compression is now available across all Windows Server editions.

Windows Server software-defined datacenter (WSSD) capabilities abstract physical hardware resources to create elastic pools for compute, storage, and networking.
