### Reflection

After completing this exercise, take a moment to think about how you can make the most of assignment management:

- *How could you structure assignments and deadlines to support students with different learning speeds?*

- *How might tracking engagement and performance help you identify students who need extra support?*

- *Which strategies could you use to give timely feedback that motivates and guides learners?*

Reflecting on these questions ensures that your use of Microsoft Learning Zone maximizes both learning outcomes and classroom efficiency.
