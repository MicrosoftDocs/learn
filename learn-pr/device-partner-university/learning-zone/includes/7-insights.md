Imagine you assigned your class a math lesson on fractions using Microsoft Learning Zone. A few days later, you want to check how your students are doing—who’s engaging with the activity, who might be struggling, and how the class is performing overall. Instead of sorting through individual submissions, you can use Assignment Insights in Microsoft Learning Zone to quickly see real-time performance data and identify where more support might be needed.

1. Open the Reports Tab

   - Launch Microsoft Learning Zone on your Copilot+ PC.
   - From the navigation panel, select Reports. There's a list of all your assigned lessons along with basic information, including the number of learners and average grade for each assignment.

2. Select an assignment to review

   - Choose the lesson or activity you want to analyze. A detailed view opens, showing:
      - Participation rate: How many students started or completed the assignment.
      - Average score: The class average for the assignment.
      - Students needing support: Learners flagged as potentially struggling based on their results or activity patterns.

3. View detailed reports

   - Select a student’s name to open an individual performance report.
   - Review their participation, scores, and completed exercises.
   - You can also switch to a per-exercise view to see which questions or tasks most students found challenging.

4. Invite more learners

   - From the detailed report view, you can invite more students to the assignment.
   - Select Get join link or code, then copy and share it with any other learners.

> [!NOTE]
> Insights are updated dynamically as students engage with lessons, giving you a current snapshot of class progress and performance trends.

### Reflection

After completing this exercise, take a moment to consider how insights can improve your teaching decisions:

   - *How can the participation and performance data help you plan targeted follow-up lessons?*

   - *What strategies could you use to support students identified as needing extra help?*

   - *How might sharing progress insights with students or parents promote accountability and motivation?*

Reflecting on these questions helps you use Microsoft Learning Zone data to inform instruction, personalize support, and celebrate learning progress.
