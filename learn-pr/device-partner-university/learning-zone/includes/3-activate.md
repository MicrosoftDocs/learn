Before educators begin creating lessons or assigning activities, Microsoft Learning Zone must be activated and installed for your school or organization. This setup ensures that both educators and students can seamlessly access the app through their Microsoft 365 Education accounts.

## Activate Microsoft Learning Zone

IT administrators are responsible for enabling access to Microsoft Learning Zone within their organization. Activation is straightforward:

   1. Visit the Learning Zone Admin page at [https://aka.ms/LearningZoneAdmin](https://aka.ms/LearningZoneAdmin).
   2. Turn on the appropriate activation toggle to enable Microsoft Learning Zone for your institution.

This action grants educators permission to download and use the app on Copilot+ PC devices. Once Learning Zone becomes generally available, it will be accessible to everyone in your organization by default unless an administrator explicitly disables it.

> [!TIP]
> Enabling Learning Zone early allows teachers to explore its capabilities during the public preview phase and provide feedback before wide deployment.

## Download the app

Once Microsoft Learning Zone has been activated by your IT administrator, educators can download it directly from [https://aka.ms/getLZ](https://aka.ms/getLZ). Installation takes only a few minutes.

After installing the app, sign in using your Microsoft 365 Education credentials associated with your A1, A3, or A5 license.

> [!NOTE]
> Microsoft Learning Zone is currently available only in English and requires a Microsoft 365 Education A1, A3, or A5 license on a Copilot+ PC device.
