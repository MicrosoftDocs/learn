Imagine you’re a high school science teacher preparing for a unit on ecosystems. You want to create a lesson that engages your students with interactive content while tailoring exercises to different learning levels. Using Microsoft Learning Zone, you can quickly generate a lesson, preview it from the student perspective, and make adjustments to ensure it meets the needs of your class.

## Generate a lesson

1. Start a new lesson

   - Open Microsoft Learning Zone on your Copilot+ PC and sign in with your Microsoft 365 Education account.

   - Navigate to My Lessons and select Create new lesson.

3. Set the lesson goal

   - Once your content is selected, select Next.

   - Choose the goal of your lesson. Based on your selection, Microsoft Learning Zone generates a set of content slides, practice activities, and quizzes.

   - You can also generate a Kahoot! quiz to engage students interactively.

4. Review and adjust

   - Microsoft Learning Zone allows you to preview and edit each slide.

   - Switch between Edit mode (to make adjustments) and Play mode (to review the lesson from the student’s perspective).

   To learn more about reviewing and editing your lessons, go to [Review and edit your lesson in Microsoft Learning Zone](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/review-and-edit-your-lesson-in-microsoft-learning-zone-67143592-2b5c-43ab-93f1-9f6f192a04c1).

4. Save your lesson

   - Once you’re satisfied with the lesson content, select Save.

> [!NOTE]
> Premade lessons are also available on the Microsoft Learning Zone. It provides access to a comprehensive Content Gallery, enabling you to efficiently locate high-quality, premade lessons from a range of reputable sources. To access the Content Gallery, navigate to the Discover tab.

Now, let’s pretend you also need to assess your students’ understanding of the material in a fun and interactive way. Instead of creating a separate quiz from scratch, you can use Microsoft Learning Zone to generate a Kahoot! quiz directly from your lesson. This allows you to instantly provide students with an engaging review activity that reinforces learning and gives immediate feedback.

## Generate a Kahoot! quiz

The Microsoft Learning Zone application includes the ability to generate Kahoot! quizzes, making it easy for educators to create interactive and fun assessments that support student learning and retention.

- Choose Kahoot! as your goal: If you select a Kahoot! quiz as the goal of your lesson before generating it, you can connect the generated quiz to your Kahoot account.

- Quiz Location: The quiz will "live" in Kahoot, not in Microsoft Learning Zone. Once created, it becomes part of your Kahoot account and is managed there.

### Sign in to Kahoot!

The first time you use this feature, select Log in to Kahoot! and enter your account credentials. Your sign-in info will be saved for future sessions.

> [!TIP]
> You can sign out of your Kahoot account by selecting your username.

### Launch the quiz

To assign the quiz, open Kahoot! by selecting Open Kahoot! in the lower-right corner.

> [!NOTE]
> The Open Kahoot! option is grayed out until the generation is completed.

You can't make changes to this quiz in Microsoft Learning Zone. Edits must be made within Kahoot! according to your license.

## Reflection

After completing this exercise, take a moment to think about how the tools you used can enhance teaching:

- *How could the generated lesson and Kahoot! quiz be adapted to better support students with varying skill levels and learning needs?*

- *Which interactive elements or activities are likely to increase engagement and motivation for your learners?*

Reflecting on these questions helps you apply Microsoft Learning Zone thoughtfully, ensuring your lessons aren't only personalized but also effective and engaging for all students.
