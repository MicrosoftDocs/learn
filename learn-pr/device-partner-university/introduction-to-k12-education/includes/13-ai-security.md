Microsoft Education is leading the way in AI innovation for schools—with a strong foundation in security, privacy, and responsible use.

## Responsible AI Standard

Microsoft is guided by our [Responsible AI Standard](https://www.microsoft.com/ai/principles-and-approach)—a document that details our approach to safe and secure AI.

Our Responsible AI framework is built around six principles:

- **Fairness:** AI systems should treat all people fairly.
- **Reliability and safety:** AI systems should perform reliably and safely.
- **Privacy and security:** AI systems should be secure and respect privacy.
- **Inclusiveness:** AI systems should empower everyone and engage all people.
- **Transparency:** AI systems should be understandable.
- **Accountability:** People should be accountable for AI systems.

### Data is private

Chat and other data will only be used as the user instructs.

### Data protection is consistent

Copilot respects controls and policies set across Microsoft 365 subscriptions.

### Data isn’t used to train AI models

Prompts, responses, and data aren't used to train foundation models.
