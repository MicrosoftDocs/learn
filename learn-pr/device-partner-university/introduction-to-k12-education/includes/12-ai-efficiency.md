Now let's look at how generative AI solutions, like Copilot, can help improve efficiency in K-12 institutions.

### Empower everyone

Just like every learner is different, so is every educational institution. Rather than providing a one-size-fits-all solution—which might not work for every need—AI can be tailored to the unique needs of any institution’s students, faculty, and staff.

### Maximize data value

K-12 institutions have to handle lots of complex data every day—from teachers adjusting lesson plans to meet their students’ needs to districts deciding how to spend funding. AI can help streamline their data and analytics to boost collaboration, protect sensitive data, and turn insights into action.

### Personalize engagement

In a traditional classroom, educators must spend time and energy creating individualized lesson materials, assessments, and supports for students. AI can streamline and automate this process, providing students with personalized engagement that responds to their individual needs—and giving teachers back time.
