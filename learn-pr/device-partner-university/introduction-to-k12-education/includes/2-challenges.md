Before diving into the specifics of Microsoft Education, it’s important to understand the current educational landscape—and the trends impacting educational technology.

## The need for equity

K-12 institutions serve an incredible 1.3 billion students globally. Every single one of these students must be given access to a high-quality education—regardless of their abilities or socioeconomic status.

This need for equity requires schools to do everything they can to ensure they're providing an appropriate learning environment for all students.

## Purchasing decisions

There are many ways purchasing decisions are made for K-12 schools. Sometimes purchases are decided at a national level, while other times they are made at a provincial/state level, via a consortia, or by local school districts.  

This lack of standardization can create a highly fragmented process, making sales difficult.

## The growth of AI

We're only starting to understand the impacts generative AI can have on our world—and schools recognize that they need to have a better grasp of these new technologies to set up their students for future success.  

With proper integration, generative AI can help support everyone—from students to teachers, school staff, and IT.

## Slow to change

K-12 institutions are traditionally slow to adopt new technology. During remote or hybrid learning, schools had to quickly adjust to using new technology. Now, they need to figure out how to keep using and supporting these tools in the long term.

Schools might also struggle with outdated infrastructure and restrictive data laws.

## Security struggles

Cyberattacks have hit K-12 school districts all around the globe—making security top of mind for many institutions.

School systems need a unified technology solution that streamlines and simplifies the management and security of their IT environment—enabling them to ensure the safety of their most sensitive data.
