School leaders have roles like superintendent, school board member, or principal.

They have major power when making purchases—but might need support understanding technical details.

These leaders are looking for solutions that are secure, affordable, equitable, and designed to stay relevant for a long time. They want to be sure that their technology investments are sound—and will keep their students safe.

IT professionals, like Chief Technology Officers, IT managers, or Directors of Technology, play a large role in technology purchasing decisions.

They're looking for solutions that are easy to deploy and manage, compatible with their current systems, and secure against threats.

In addition, IT professionals are concerned about ensuring solutions are compliant with all necessary laws—especially as they expand into using AI and the cloud.

## Educators

While not directly responsible for purchasing decisions, educators play a key role in influencing investments—so it’s important to speak to their needs and wants.

Educators want technology that adds value to their classroom. They want solutions that supplement their teaching and free up time for more direct instruction. They also want technology that is easy to use and provides meaningful, student-centered learning experiences.
