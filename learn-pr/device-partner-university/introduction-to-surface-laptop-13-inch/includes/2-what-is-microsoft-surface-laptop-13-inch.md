Microsoft Surface Laptop 13-inch is a Copilot+ PC built by Microsoft. As the lightest model in the Surface Laptop range, it offers added portability to get work done from virtually any location. By combining software, hardware, and AI features, Surface Laptop 13-inch simplifies the completion of routine tasks and enables business users to execute

goals with the latest generation of hardware and software advancements.

## Hardware

Imagine your IT team needs to equip project managers with a laptop that balances performance and flexibility. Surface Laptop 13-inch offers hardware that fits these needs. Let’s look at some of the device specifications that solve this need without adding complexity.

- **Qualcomm Snapdragon X Plus (8-core) X1P-42-100 processor**: The CPU (Central Processing Unit) of Surface Laptop 13-inch offers eight cores running at 3.4 GHz, paired with an NPU (Neural Processing Unit) capable of 45 TOPS (trillions of operations per second)—enabling over 40 local AI models to run directly on the device. This hardware combination enables a variety of on-device AI experiences, including document summaries, multilingual translation, and multimonitor setups to complete work.
- **13” PixelSense Display**: Surface Laptop 13-inch features a 13” display with PixelSense technology, offering touch inputs in addition to using peripherals. It also features a 3:2 aspect ratio, ideal for vertical content—displaying more data in apps like Microsoft Word and Outlook. The screen features 400 nits of maximum brightness, allowing use in various lighting conditions.
- **Port and charging:** Surface Laptop 13-inch features two USB-C ports that support charging, data transfer, DisplayPort 1.4a (supporting up to two 4K monitors at 60Hz), and Surface Thunderbolt 4 dock and other accessories. Charging on this model is done via one of the USB-C ports—supporting fast charging at 60W. In addition to the USB-C ports, Surface Laptop 13-inch also features one USB-A 3.1 port and a 3.5mm headphone jack for wired audio.

## Software

In our scenario, your IT team is looking for a solution that places a focus on performance. On-device Copilot+ PC AI features on Surface Laptop 13-inch help to accomplish tasks faster.

- **Live Captions:** This accessibility feature translates audio from 44 different languages into English captions. Live Captions can be turned on in Accessibility settings under Captions and works with a wide range of media—including streaming services, video calls, and local video files.
- **Windows Studio Effects:** For those that are on video calls often, this feature helps to optimize video effects while on camera and can be turned on through quick settings. These can frame the subject to be centered, optimize lighting in poorly lit environments, and simulate eye contact.
- **Click to Do:** This feature identifies text and images on your screen, analyzes it, and provides actionable options that you can select based on the content. Click to Do only identifies text and images, not the content of those text or images and performed locally on device.

## Security

IT teams value security above many features. Surface Laptop 13-inch delivers chip-to-cloud security. Surface Laptop 13-inch offers multiple layers of security.

- **Secured-core PC:** Windows integrates closely with Surface hardware to deliver protections that take advantage of hardware capabilities. As a Secured-core PC, Surface Laptop 13-inch leverages TPM 2.0 for a hardware root of trust, secure boot, and BitLocker drive encryption. This hardware provides protections that are useful against sophisticated attacks and can provide increased assurance when handling mission-critical data in data-sensitive industries.
- **Microsoft Pluton:** Surface Laptop 13-inch features the Microsoft Pluton security processor—a hardware-based security chip that’s integrated directly into the CPU (Central Processing Unit) . Microsoft Pluton provides hardware-based root of trust, secure identity, secure attestation, and cryptographic services. Pluton technology is a combination of a secure subsystem, which is part of the System on Chip (SoC) and Microsoft authored software that runs on this integrated secure subsystem.
- **Device Firmware Configuration Interface (DFCI):** Designed to be used with software-level mobile device management (MDM), DFCI enables IT admins to remotely disable specific hardware components and prevent end users from accessing them. For example, if you need to protect sensitive information in highly secure areas, you can disable the camera, and if you don't want users booting from USB drives, you can disable that as well.
- **Windows Autopilot:** Deploying Surface Laptop 13-inch is simplified for IT teams with Windows Autopilot. This feature simplifies the Windows device lifecycle, for both IT and end users, from initial development to end of life. Autopilot streamlines IT deployment processes, minimizes infrastructure maintenance requirements, and enhances usability for end users.
