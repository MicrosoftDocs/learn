Organizations that still operate Windows 10 devices need a consistent way to measure post-EOS risk and the value of modernization. The **[Windows 10 EOS Calculator](https://tei.forrester.com/go/microsoft/windows10eos/)**—developed by **Microsoft and Forrester Consulting**—offers a structured, research-based approach to quantify the financial and operational impact of moving to **Windows 11 Pro**. Use it to size your current exposure, compare timelines, and align security, productivity, and budget priorities with real numbers.

This interactive tool helps organizations:
- **Quantify** ongoing costs and risks of maintaining Windows 10 after EOS  
- **Model** ROI and savings associated with upgrading to Windows 11 Pro devices  
- **Plan** modernization strategies based on device counts, timelines, and regional costs  
- **Communicate** evidence-based findings to executive decision-makers

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The calculator uses [Forrester’s TEI assumptions](https://tei.forrester.com/go/microsoft/windows10eos/#:~:text=competitive%20product%20analysis.-,TEI%20Methodology,-TEI%20not%20only) to estimate risk exposure, including increased incident rates and support costs. These are directional—not predictive—but they help IT leaders visualize the cost of delay.

## What it means now that Windows 10 support has ended

As of October 14, 2025, Windows 10 devices no longer receive:
- Monthly **security updates** or bug fixes  
- **Technical support** from Microsoft  
- New **compatibility improvements** for software or drivers

Running Windows 10 post-EOS often leads to:
- **Heightened security risk**, including exposure to new vulnerabilities  
- **Rising support costs** as IT teams maintain outdated systems  
- **Limited compatibility** with modern applications, AI tools, and cloud management platforms  
- **Reduced productivity** as performance and reliability degrade

The Windows 10 EOS Calculator helps IT decision-makers quantify these impacts and build a modernization roadmap toward Windows 11 Pro.

## Why upgrading to Windows 11 Pro matters now

If you keep Windows 10 devices in service, protecting them typically requires purchasing **[Extented Security Updates](/windows/whats-new/extended-security-updates)** (ESU)—an expense that escalates annually. Upgrading to Windows 11 Pro is a strategic alternative: it strengthens security, improves performance, and aligns your fleet with future technologies and support lifecycles.

Windows 11 Pro is designed for modern security, AI-enhanced productivity, and long-term stability:
- **Advanced security:** chip-to-cloud protections, Windows Hello, TPM 2.0, memory integrity  
- **AI-ready workflows:** Copilot in Windows streamlines everyday tasks and information retrieval  
- **Simplified IT:** automated management via Microsoft Intune, Windows Autopatch, and Microsoft Entra join

## Extended Security Updates (ESU) cost overview

Organizations that elect to continue using Windows 10 after support ends on **October 14, 2025** can enroll PCs in a paid ESU subscription. The **Year 1** list price is **$61 USD per device** for commercial/education licensing. The price **doubles each consecutive year** (maximum of three years), and ESU is **cumulative**—if you start in Year 2, you must also purchase Year 1.

### ESU cost example: 10 Windows 10 devices (organizations)

| Year | ESU price **per device** (USD) | Annual cost for **10 devices** | Running total for **10 devices** (if enrolled from Year 1) |
|------|-------------------------------:|--------------------------------:|------------------------------------------------------------:|
| 1    | $61                            | $610                            | $610                                                        |
| 2    | $122                           | $1,220                          | $1,830                                                      |
| 3    | $244                           | $2,440                          | $4,270                                                      |

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Prices double each year (maxium three years) and ESUs are cumulative. Starting in Year 2 requires paying for Year 1 as well. Use this to know when to use Windows 10 Extended Security Updates.

These benefits inform the calculator’s methodology and underscore the business case for modernization.

## Supported by research

The Windows 10 EOS Calculator uses Forrester’s TEI framework, combining research and customer data to estimate ROI and costs across timelines.

Forrester’s *[Total Economic Impact™ of Windows 11 Pro Devices (2022)](https://tei.forrester.com/go/microsoft/windows11enterprise)* found that organizations achieved:
- **250% ROI** over three years  
- **62% reduction** in security incidents  
- **15% productivity gain** per employee

Imagine a mid-sized organization with 1,000 Windows 10 devices delaying upgrade by 12 months could face up to \$300K in ESU costs and a 20% increase in support overhead, based on TEI modeling.

By combining your inputs with [Forrester’s Total Economic Impact (TEI) research](https://tools.totaleconomicimpact.com/go/microsoft/Windows11Devices/), the calculator provides **custom insights** that support modernization planning and long-term device strategy. Use the calculator as a decision aid. It provides directional estimates based on TEI assumptions and your data—it doesn't replace detailed financial planning, security threat modeling, or hardware compatibility testing.

> [!TIP]  
> Before you begin, gather an approximate device count, your typical refresh cadence (for example, every 3–5 years), and whether updates are cloud-managed. Exact numbers aren’t required to explore scenarios and compare timelines.
