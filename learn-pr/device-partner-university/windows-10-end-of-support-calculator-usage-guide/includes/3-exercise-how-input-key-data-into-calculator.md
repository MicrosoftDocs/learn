The Windows 10 EOS Calculator homepage summarizes the model and how your inputs are analyzed. There’s no separate setup—the calculator processes data in real time as you enter values.

The interface is split into two sections:
- **Left pane:** enter key organizational data  
- **Right pane:** review results that update automatically

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Default figures illustrate sample outcomes based on Forrester’s research. Adjust them to reflect your environment so the estimates better match your reality.

> [!TIP]
> If you don’t have an exact device count, start with a conservative estimate. You can refine values later and compare the differences.
