  Explore how Windows 11 Pro is evolving into a cloud-connected platform designed to support modern work. This module explains how Windows serves as the canvas where users initiate and manage intelligent tasks, while execution occurs locally or in the cloud depending on each task’s needs. You’ll learn how cloud execution enables deeper reasoning, long-running workflows, and access to broader data sources, and how these capabilities are integrated directly into familiar Windows experiences such as the taskbar, Ask Copilot, and AI agents—allowing users to stay productive while work continues in the background.

  By the end of this module, you'll be able to:
  - Describe how Windows 11 Pro uses cloud-based and on-device execution models to support different types of AI-assisted tasks and workflows.
  - Identify scenarios where cloud execution is used in Windows 11 Pro, including long-running, multi-step tasks that require reasoning, synthesis, or access to broader data sources.
  - Demonstrate how to initiate and monitor cloud-based work from the Windows taskbar, using Ask Copilot and AI agents to remain productive while tasks run in the background.
