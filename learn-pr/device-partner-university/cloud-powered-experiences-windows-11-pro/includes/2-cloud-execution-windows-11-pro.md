Windows 11 Pro is designed to take advantage of cloud services as part of the operating system experience. Rather than running all tasks locally on the device, Windows can offload certain types of work to Microsoft's cloud, where greater compute capacity and broader data access are available.

Cloud execution in Windows 11 Pro is especially well suited for scenarios that involve:

- **Deeper reasoning and analysis**, such as synthesizing information across multiple sources
- **Access to broader data sets**, including organizational data and permitted web content
- **Longer running or multi-step tasks** that don't need to complete instantly
- **Continuous improvement**, where capabilities can evolve through cloud services without requiring changes to device hardware or the Windows client

At the same time, Windows continues to run many experiences locally on the device. Windows 11 Pro selects the most appropriate execution model based on the needs of each task, balancing performance, responsiveness, and capability.

This hybrid approach allows Windows to:

- Use **local processing** when speed, efficiency, or offline access is important
- Use **cloud services** when scale, intelligence, or extended processing is required
- Deliver consistent, intelligent experiences across a wide range of devices and configurations

The following units explore how Windows 11 Pro applies this approach in practice, using cloud-powered experiences such as Copilot and AI agents to demonstrate how cloud execution is integrated directly into everyday workflows.

## Examples of cloud-based services in Windows 11 Pro

Windows 11 Pro relies on a range of cloud-based services to support intelligent, connected experiences across the operating system. These services provide capabilities that extend beyond local device processing, enabling reasoning, data access, and long-running workflows that integrate directly into Windows.

Common examples of cloud-based services used in Windows 11 Pro include:

- **Microsoft Copilot services**, which provide cloud-based reasoning, synthesis, and natural language understanding across supported Windows and Microsoft 365 experiences
- **AI agents**, which run multi-step, long-running tasks using cloud execution while remaining visible and manageable through the Windows interface
- **Microsoft 365 cloud services**, which supply organizational context, documents, email, and collaboration data for supported Copilot experiences
- **Search and indexing services**, which enhance system and content discovery by combining local signals with cloud-powered intelligence
- **Security and identity services**, such as Microsoft Entra ID, which support authentication, access control, and policy enforcement across cloud-connected experiences

| **Cloud service** | **What it provides** | **Simple example** |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Microsoft Copilot services | Cloud-based reasoning and natural language understanding | Ask Copilot to summarize a document using cloud models |
| AI agents | Multi-step, long‑running tasks handled in the cloud | Researcher agent gathers and synthesizes information while you work |
| Microsoft 365 cloud services | Organizational context and content access | Copilot retrieves relevant emails and files to answer a question |
| Search/indexing services | Cloud + local blended search intelligence | Windows Search surfaces documents based on cloud signals |
| Identity services (Entra ID) | Authentication, access, conditional policies | Verifying user identity before retrieving sensitive org data |

These services are integrated into Windows at the operating system level, allowing users to interact with cloud-powered capabilities through familiar system interfaces such as the taskbar, search, and notifications.
