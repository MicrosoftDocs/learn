Some types of work don't resolve with a single prompt or quick response. Tasks such as gathering background information, comparing sources, or understanding unfamiliar topics often require multiple steps, reasoning across inputs, and synthesis over time.

Researcher is a Microsoft 365 Copilot agent designed for these scenarios. It demonstrates how Windows 11 Pro uses cloud execution to support complex, long-running tasks while allowing users to continue working locally without interruption.

Rather than returning an immediate answer, Researcher operates as a background cloud workload. It gathers information from approved sources, reasons across multiple inputs, and produces a structured output when the task is complete.

## How Researcher uses cloud execution

Research tasks often require capabilities that are well suited to cloud execution. By running in the cloud, Researcher can access broader information sources, apply deeper reasoning, and manage multi-step workflows that would be impractical to process instantly or locally on a device.

Cloud execution allows Researcher to:

- search and retrieve relevant information from multiple sources,
- reason across those sources to identify patterns or themes,
- and synthesize findings into a clear, concise result.

Because this processing occurs in the cloud, Researcher can continue working independently while the user focuses on other tasks in Windows.

## Working while research runs in the background

When a user starts a research task, Researcher runs independently using cloud execution. Progress is surfaced through familiar Windows experiences, such as taskbar indicators and notifications, allowing users to stay aware of the task without actively monitoring it.

This approach reflects the broader Windows execution model:

- **Local interaction** remains focused on responsiveness and productivity
- **Cloud execution** handles extended reasoning and analysis in the background

By separating interaction from execution, Windows 11 Pro enables users to delegate complex work without disrupting their workflow.

## When Researcher is most useful

Researcher is particularly effective for tasks that involve exploration and synthesis, such as investigating unfamiliar topics, gathering background information for reports or presentations, or comparing multiple approaches or options.

In these scenarios, cloud execution allows Researcher to take the time it needs to reason across sources and deliver a thoughtful result, while Windows keeps users productive elsewhere.
