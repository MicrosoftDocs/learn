Imagine you've been asked to prepare a short briefing on an unfamiliar topic—for example, how a new industry regulation might impact your organization. You need background information, comparisons across sources, and a concise summary, but you also need to continue working on other responsibilities throughout the day.

In this scenario, you use the Windows taskbar as a starting point to initiate cloud-based assistance, delegate longer-running research, and monitor progress while remaining productive in Windows.

## Step 1: Open Copilot from the Windows taskbar

In this step, you'll access Copilot directly from the Windows taskbar.

- Locate the **Search box** on the Windows taskbar.
- Select the search box to open the Copilot experience integrated into Windows.
- Confirm that you can see options to:
  - search for **apps, files, and settings**
  - start a **Copilot chat or voice session**

>[!NOTE]
> The Search box serves as a single entry point for both local search and cloud-powered Copilot interactions.

## Step 2: Start a Copilot chat or voice session

Once Copilot is open, you can begin interacting with cloud-based intelligence. This step shows how users initiate cloud execution directly from the taskbar.

- From the **taskbar search box**, open the Copilot experience by either selecting **Ask Copilot** or using the Copilot entry point available in the search interface.
- Once Copilot is active, enter a question or prompt, or start a voice session.
- Review the response returned by Copilot.

You can initiate cloud-based reasoning and information retrieval without opening a separate application.

## Step 3: Select an agent from the taskbar

Some tasks require additional time or multiple steps to complete. In this step, you'll select an AI agent that runs using cloud execution to handle longer-running work.

- In the Copilot taskbar experience, locate the list of available **agents**.
- Review the **curated list of agents** provided.
- Select an agent that supports a long-running task you want to complete.

Agents enable cloud-based work to continue over time, even after the initial interaction is complete.

## Step 4: Monitor agent progress

After an agent starts running, Windows exposes its activity through the taskbar. This step demonstrates how Windows keeps cloud-based work visible and manageable while you continue working locally.

- After starting an agent, observe how it **moves to the taskbar** while it runs.
- Continue working on other tasks while the agent completes its work in the background.
- Check the taskbar at any time to:
  - View the **status** of the agent
  - Respond if the agent asks questions or requests your consent

## Step 5: Review the results

When the agent completes its task, Windows notifies you through the taskbar. In this step, you'll review the results produced by cloud execution.

- Wait for the notification indicating that the agent has completed its task.
- Select the notification to open the results in the **Microsoft 365 Copilot application**.
- Review the output provided by the agent.

In this exercise, you began by accessing Copilot directly from the Windows taskbar to ask an initial question and establish context. Because the task required deeper research and synthesis, you then selected a Researcher agent to gather information from approved sources and analyze the topic in more detail.

While the agent ran using cloud execution, you were able to continue working locally in Windows, checking progress from the taskbar as needed. When the research was complete, Windows surfaced a notification, allowing you to review a structured summary of the findings in Microsoft 365 Copilot.

Together, this scenario illustrates how Windows 11 Pro enables you to initiate cloud-powered work, delegate long-running tasks, and stay productive while intelligent processing continues in the background.
