In this module, you explored how Windows 11 Pro is evolving into a cloud-connected platform that supports modern, AI-assisted work. Instead of treating cloud intelligence as a separate tool, Windows integrates cloud execution directly into everyday system experiences.

Key takeaways include:

- **Hybrid execution models:** Windows 11 Pro balances local and cloud execution to optimize performance, efficiency, and capability. Tasks that benefit from speed and responsiveness run locally—often using specialized hardware like NPUs—while more complex, long-running work runs in the cloud.
- **Cloud experiences built into Windows:** Features like **Ask Copilot** on the taskbar provide quick access to cloud-based assistance without interrupting the user's workflow. For deeper tasks, AI agents continue working in the background, with progress surfaced through familiar taskbar indicators and notifications.
- **Deep reasoning with Researcher:** Researcher demonstrates how cloud execution enables multi-step analysis, access to multiple sources, and synthesis over time—allowing complex work to progress while users continue working locally.

Together, these experiences show how cloud execution is a foundational part of Windows 11 Pro, not an add-on. By blending cloud intelligence with local execution and surfacing it through familiar interfaces, Windows helps users stay productive, focused, and in control.
