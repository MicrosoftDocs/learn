Ask Copilot on the Windows 11 taskbar provides a lightweight starting point for cloud-based assistance in Windows. Rather than opening a separate application, users can access Microsoft Copilot directly from the taskbar to initiate requests that rely on cloud services for reasoning, search, and synthesis.

By placing Copilot directly on the taskbar, Windows 11 Pro displays cloud execution as part of the operating system itself. Users can begin AI-assisted work without leaving their current app, while processing and reasoning take place in the cloud.

This design reflects Windows' hybrid execution model:

- **User interaction** happens locally within the Windows interface
- **Intelligent processing** runs in the cloud when deeper reasoning or broader context is required

## What is Ask Copilot (taskbar experience)?

Ask Copilot is a compact entry point integrated into the Windows 11 taskbar. It serves as an entry point for initiating cloud-powered tasks using natural language, without interrupting the user's current workflow.

From this single interface, users can:

- Ask questions or submit requests using natural language
- Search across local content, organizational data, and permitted web sources
- Initiate AI-assisted tasks that rely on cloud execution

These interactions are powered by Microsoft cloud services, which enable Copilot to reason across data sources, apply context, and generate responses that go beyond what can be processed locally on the device.

> A Microsoft 365 Copilot license is required to use Copilot with your organization's Microsoft 365 data, including emails, files, meetings, and to access built‑in agents.

## Accessing Ask Copilot (taskbar experience)

Users interact with Ask Copilot directly from the Windows taskbar. The composer appears as a small, focused interface that supports:

- **Text input** for quick requests
- **Voice activation** (for supported configurations)

Because the composer is embedded in the taskbar, users can invoke cloud-based intelligence while remaining in their current app or window. This allows Windows to deliver cloud execution without disrupting local workflows.

## How Ask Copilot (taskbar experience) uses the cloud

Ask Copilot relies on cloud services to interpret user intent and perform intelligent actions. When a user submits a request, cloud-based services can:

- Interpret intent using large language models
- Connect to Microsoft 365 services for organizational context
- Retrieve relevant information from approved data sources
- Apply reasoning and synthesis across multiple inputs

This cloud-connected approach enables consistent Copilot experiences across devices and allows capabilities to improve over time without requiring updates to the Windows client.

## Why Ask Copilot relies on cloud execution

Some of the tasks Ask Copilot supports require capabilities that extend beyond what can be efficiently processed on a local device. Cloud execution enables Ask Copilot to:

- **Apply deeper reasoning** across complex or ambiguous requests
- **Access broader context**, including organizational data and permitted web sources
- **Handle multi-step requests** that may take time to complete
- **Scale processing** without depending on device hardware capabilities

By using cloud services for these scenarios, Windows 11 Pro can deliver advanced AI-assisted experiences while keeping local system resources focused on responsiveness and everyday performance.

This approach allows users to benefit from powerful intelligence without needing specialized hardware, while maintaining a consistent experience across the Windows ecosystem.

## Ask Copilot (taskbar experience) and agent-based work

Some requests can be completed quickly, while others require extended processing time or multiple steps. For these scenarios, Ask Copilot can initiate AI agents that run using cloud execution.

When an agent is started, the task moves out of the composer, allowing the user to continue their work. The agent begins working in the background, and progress is surfaced on the Windows taskbar.

This allows users to continue working locally while longer-running cloud tasks proceed in the background. Windows maintains visibility and control by keeping agent activity accessible from a familiar system interface.
