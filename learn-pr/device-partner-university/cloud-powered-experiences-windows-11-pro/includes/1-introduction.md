Windows 11 Pro is evolving from a traditional desktop operating system into a cloud-connected platform designed to support modern work. As tasks become more complex—often involving multiple sources of information, extended reasoning, and work that continues over time—Windows is adapting how and where that work runs.

Microsoft often describes Windows 11 Pro as the *canvas for AI*. In practice, this means Windows provides the environment where users interact with AI-assisted work, while intelligent processing can occur either locally on the device or in the cloud, depending on the needs of the task.

Rather than relying solely on local device processing, Windows 11 Pro uses cloud services as part of the operating system experience. This allows Windows to offload certain types of work to the cloud when greater compute capacity, broader data access, or longer processing time is required, while continuing to run other tasks locally for speed, responsiveness, and efficiency.

This hybrid approach enables Windows to deliver intelligence directly within familiar system experiences. Instead of switching between applications or waiting for tasks to complete, users can initiate, monitor, and return to cloud-powered work while continuing to use Windows as they normally would.

In this module, you'll explore how Windows 11 Pro applies cloud execution in practice. You'll examine how different execution models support modern workflows, and how cloud-powered experiences—such as Copilot and AI agents—are integrated directly into the Windows interface to help users stay productive while work runs in the background.

## Learning objectives

- Describe how Windows 11 Pro uses cloud-based and on-device execution models to support different types of AI-assisted tasks and workflows.
- Identify scenarios where cloud execution is used in Windows 11 Pro, including long-running, multi-step tasks that require reasoning, synthesis, or access to broader data sources.
- Demonstrate how to initiate and monitor cloud-based work from the Windows taskbar, using Ask Copilot and AI agents to remain productive while tasks run in the background.
