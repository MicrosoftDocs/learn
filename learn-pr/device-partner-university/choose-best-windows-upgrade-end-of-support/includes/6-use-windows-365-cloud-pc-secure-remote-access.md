The organization supports a large, distributed workforce. Employees connect from home offices, shared workspaces, and personal devices. Several business-critical applications are legacy and still require a full Windows desktop environment to function correctly.

IT must deliver secure access without depending on the security or performance of each individual endpoint. At the same time, the organization wants predictable costs and simplified onboarding for new and temporary workers.

## Decision signals in this environment

- Remote users connect from **mixed device types**
- **Legacy Windows apps** must remain accessible
- IT needs **centralized security**, not per-device enforcement
- Workforce size and access needs **change frequently**
- Help desk teams need **fast provisioning and deprovisioning**

## Why Windows 365 Cloud PC is the best fit

- Delivers a secure, cloud-hosted Windows desktop users can access from nearly any device  
- Keeps applications and data inside the cloud environment, reducing exposure on unmanaged endpoints  
- Supports legacy Windows applications without requiring local installation  
- Simplifies onboarding and offboarding for contractors, seasonal staff, and remote employees  

## Why the other options are less optimal

- **Windows 11 on new devices**  
  - Improves security and performance but requires physical device deployment and logistics coordination  
  - Adds shipping, inventory, and replacement complexity for a remote workforce  

- **Windows 10 ESU**  
  - Extends security updates only and doesn't address remote access or centralized management  
  - Leaves security responsibility on the endpoint rather than shifting it to the cloud  

### How this supports the organization

Windows 365 aligns naturally with a remote-first model by centralizing security, access, and application delivery in the cloud. It reduces dependency on endpoint hardware while giving users a consistent Windows experience wherever they work.
