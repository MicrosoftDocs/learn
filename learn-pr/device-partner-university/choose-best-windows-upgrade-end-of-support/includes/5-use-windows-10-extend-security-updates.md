The organization operates hundreds of Windows 10 devices that no longer meet Windows 11 hardware requirements. Budget limitations prevent a full device refresh in the near term, but security and operational continuity remain mandatory.

Instead of replacing all devices at once, IT must balance short-term protection with long-term modernization planning.

## Current environment snapshot

| Factor | Current Reality |
|--------|------------------|
| Device eligibility | Large percentage of devices fail Windows 11 requirements |
| Budget | Limited capital available this fiscal year |
| Security | Devices must continue receiving updates |
| User workflows | Stable on Windows 10 |
| Cloud readiness | Still in early adoption stages |

This mix strongly favors a **temporary stabilization strategy** rather than immediate transformation.

## Why Windows 10 ESU is the best fit

- Maintains critical security updates for devices that can't yet be upgraded or replaced  
- Allows IT teams to sequence modernization over multiple budget cycles  
- Avoids large, immediate capital expense tied to mass hardware replacement  
- Buys time to finalize future Windows 11 and Windows 365 adoption plans  

## Why the other options are less optimal

- **Windows 11 on new devices**  
  - Requires immediate hardware replacement at scale  
  - Often conflicts with fiscal-year budget constraints  

- **Windows 365 Cloud PC**  
  - Introduces predictable monthly costs but still requires network and identity readiness  
  - Leaves aging physical hardware in service, adding long-term maintenance overhead  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> ESU is intended as a short-term risk mitigation option. Organizations using ESU should actively plan for modernization to Windows 11 or a cloud-based solution.

### How this supports the organization

Windows 10 ESU stabilizes security while giving IT leadership breathing room to align funding, procurement, and modernization strategy. It transforms an urgent security deadline into a controlled, phased transition instead of a reactive overhaul.
