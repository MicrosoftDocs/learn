Selecting the right upgrade path in a post-Windows 10 end of support environment requires more than choosing a replacement operating system. Each organization brings different priorities—security requirements, budget realities, hardware limitations, and workforce needs.

The following decision criteria provide a practical framework for evaluating **Windows 11 on new devices**, **Windows 10 ESU**, and **Windows 365 Cloud PC** in real-world environments.

Selecting the right path requires evaluating multiple criteria:

| Criteria            | Windows 11                     | Windows 10 ESU                    | Windows 365             |
|---------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------|
| **Security**        | Advanced, hardware-backed      | Security updates only          | Cloud-hosted, managed      |
| **Cost**            | Upfront (hardware + license)   | Subscription increases yearly       | Predictable subscription |
| **Hardware**        | Requires eligible devices      | Legacy hardware supported   | Any device with a browser  |
| **Cloud readiness** | Optional integration           | Not required                | Required               |
| **User experience** | Latest features                | No feature advancement      | Consistent across devices     |

## Security and compliance

Post-Windows 10 end of support, security becomes the most immediate concern. The chosen upgrade path must help reduce exposure to threats while supporting regulatory and organizational compliance requirements.

For IT teams, security decisions made after Windows 10 end of support directly influence how effectively threats can be detected, contained, and remediated. Platforms that rely on modern hardware-backed protections reduce the need for compensating controls and lower the operational burden of defending aging systems.

**Questions to consider:**
- Does this option support modern, hardware-backed security?
- Will it help maintain regulatory compliance and data protection standards?

**How the options compare:**
- **Windows 11** supports advanced security requirements such as TPM 2.0, Secure Boot, and virtualization-based security.
- **Windows 10 ESU** provides critical security updates only and doesn't introduce new protections—risk exposure increases over time.
- **Windows 365** delivers a secure, cloud-hosted Windows environment with Microsoft-managed security and compliance controls.

## Cost and licensing

Financial impact plays a major role in upgrade decisions, especially in a post-Windows 10 end of support environment. Each option introduces different cost models that affect both short-term budgets and long-term planning.

**Questions to consider:**
- Are costs primarily upfront, ongoing, or both?
- Will expenses increase over time if modernization is delayed?

**How the options compare:**
- **Windows 11** may require capital investment for device refresh, in addition to Windows licensing.
- **Windows 10 ESU** is also subscription-based and **cost increases each year it is renewed**, reinforcing its role as a temporary solution rather than a long-term strategy.
- **Windows 365** uses a predictable per-user subscription model.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Windows 10 ESU needs to be renewed each year with a paid subscription that goes up in price annually. This reinforces ESU as a short-term bridge while an organization actively plans and executes a full modernization strategy.

## Hardware compatibility

Existing hardware plays a major role in determining which paths are realistic versus those that require larger transformation.

**Questions to consider:**
- Do current devices meet Windows 11 requirements?
- Is replacing hardware part of the organization’s near-term strategy?

**How the options compare:**
- **Windows 11** has defined hardware requirements, and the best experience is achieved on new, supported devices.
- **Windows 10 ESU** allows continued use of ineligible Windows 10 devices for a limited time.
- **Windows 365** can be accessed from nearly any device with a supported browser and internet connection.

## Planning for Windows 11 readiness and deployment considerations

Before committing to Windows 11, it’s important to treat the upgrade as a deployment project that affects devices, tools, and processes across the organization.

| Planning area       | What to evaluate                         | Why it matters               |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| Device eligibility  | Meets Windows 11 requirements            | Prevents failed upgrades     |
| Management tools    | Deployment and update workflows          | Ensures compliance post-upgrade |
| App compatibility   | Test critical apps                       | Reduces disruption           |
| Servicing strategy  | Update policies for Windows 11           | Maintains security           |
| User readiness      | Communication and training               | Improves adoption            |

### Test applications and user workflows

- Even though Windows 11 is built on the same foundation as Windows 10, you should test critical applications and workflows on new or upgraded devices before wide rollout. This ensures compatibility and catches issues early.
- Consider a phased deployment model (pilot → limited → broad) to reduce risk and rollout disruptions.

### Plan a servicing and update strategy

- Review and update your servicing strategy to account for Windows 11, scheduling updates, patches, and version rollouts similarly to how you managed Windows 10.  
- If you have mixed environments (some devices on Windows 10 with ESU, some on Windows 11), ensure support policies, security baselines, and patch management processes are adapted accordingly.

### Account for user readiness and change management

- Communicate changes clearly to end users—inform them about UI changes, new security features, or requirements for device upgrades.  
- Provide support and training for new features or different workflows after upgrade to Windows 11.  
- Align help desk support and onboarding processes to manage both Windows 10 (if still in use) and Windows 11 endpoints during transition.

Upgrading to Windows 11 isn’t just a software swap—it’s a full deployment project. A successful upgrade depends on device eligibility, infrastructure readiness, compatibility testing, and a well-planned rollout. Skipping those checks increases the risk of disrupted workflows, compliance gaps, or security issues.

## Cloud readiness

Not every environment is equally prepared for cloud-hosted desktops. Governance, identity, network infrastructure, internet bandwidth, and operations must all be considered.

**Questions to consider:**
- Is identity already cloud-based?
- Is the network and internet capable of supporting cloud desktop workloads?

**How the options compare:**
- **Windows 11** remains primarily device-based with optional cloud integration.
- **Windows 10 ESU** doesn't require cloud adoption.
- **Windows 365** depends on reliable network connectivity and cloud governance.

## User experience

User experience affects adoption, productivity, and overall satisfaction. Even technically sound deployments can struggle without user alignment.

**Questions to consider:**
- Will the experience feel familiar or disruptive?
- Does the platform support modern collaboration and productivity workflows?

**How the options compare:**
- **Windows 11** introduces the latest Windows user experience and productivity features.
- **Windows 10 ESU** retains the existing Windows 10 experience without feature advancement.
- **Windows 365** provides a consistent desktop experience across locations and devices.

## Decision checkpoint: Applying the criteria

Before moving into real-world scenarios, consider how these criteria work together:

- If long-term security, performance, and device strategy are the priority, is **Windows 11 on new devices** the right foundation?
- If hardware is ineligible and modernization must be delayed, is **Windows 10 ESU** the safest temporary path?
- If predictable monthly costs and flexible access matter most, does **Windows 365** align better with workforce needs?

These decision points help shift the conversation from “Which option is available?” to broader questions of sustainability, operational impact, and long-term alignment. In most environments, the optimal path isn't purely technical—it reflects how risk tolerance, financial planning, workforce flexibility, and modernization timelines intersect across the business.

IT professionals who evaluate these criteria together are better positioned to avoid fragmented upgrades, overlapping costs, and reactive security measures.
