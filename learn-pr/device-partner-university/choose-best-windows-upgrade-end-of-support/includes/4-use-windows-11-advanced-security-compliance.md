The organization operates in a regulated industry where audit findings, supported platforms, and hardware-backed security control directly affect business risk. Regulators and third-party auditors require evidence that endpoints run on supported operating systems with modern security protections.

In this environment, unsupported platforms represent more than technical debt—they represent **compliance exposure**.

## Compliance-driven evaluation focus

- Security controls must be **hardware-backed**
- Operating systems must be **fully supported**
- Platforms must align with **long-term lifecycle planning**
- Audit teams require **clear, defensible security baselines**
- IT leadership must minimize **exception handling and waivers**

## Why Windows 11 on new devices is the best fit

- Provides modern hardware-backed security, including TPM 2.0, Secure Boot, and virtualization-based protections  
- Runs on supported, hardware-eligible platforms aligned with regulatory expectations  
- Establishes a fully supported Windows lifecycle for compliance reporting and audits  
- Creates a secure foundation for future cloud, identity, and endpoint management initiatives  

## Why the other options are less optimal

- **Windows 10 ESU**  
  - Extends security updates but doesn't change the underlying end-of-support status  
  - Becomes increasingly costly and difficult to justify in long-term audit narratives 

- **Windows 365 Cloud PC**  
  - Provides strong cloud security but may require another regulatory validation  
  - Often complements, rather than replaces, the requirement for compliant local hardware  
 
### How this supports the organization

For regulated environments, Windows 11 on new devices reduces audit complexity and long-term compliance risk. It provides a fully supported, modern platform that aligns security architecture, hardware lifecycle, and regulatory expectations into a single, defensible standard.
