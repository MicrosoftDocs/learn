Every 24 hours, an organization’s identity-related security configurations are evaluated against Microsoft’s recommended best practices. Based on this assessment, a percentage score is calculated for the directory.

Similar to Microsoft Secure Score for Devices, the identity secure score reflects how closely an organization’s identity configurations align with Microsoft’s security guidance.

## How it helps

Each recommendation is assessed based on the organization’s current configuration.

This scoring system enables organizations to monitor and improve their identity security posture by:

- Quantitatively measuring their current identity security status.
- Planning targeted improvements to identity-related configurations.
- Tracking the effectiveness of implemented changes over time.

## The score dashboard

Organizations can view their score and related metrics on the identity secure score dashboard.

The dashboard includes:

- The current identity secure score.
- A comparison graph showing how the score compares to other tenants in similar industries and of comparable size.
- A trend graph illustrating score changes over time.
- A list of recommended configuration improvements.

## Where to find it
