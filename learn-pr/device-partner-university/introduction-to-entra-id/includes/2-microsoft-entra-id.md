Microsoft Entra ID, previously known as Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), is a cloud-based identity and access management service. It enables organizations to manage user identities, control access to applications and resources, and enforce security policies.

## Identity security challenges in modern organizations

Organizations face increasing complexity in securing user identities due to evolving cyber threats and operational demands. Key challenges include:

### Credential-based threats

- Phishing and other attacks targeting employee credentials.
- Risk of unauthorized access to corporate systems and sensitive data.

### Regulatory compliance

- Need to adhere to security standards to avoid penalties and reputational damage.

### Access management complexity

- Managing access across on-premises and cloud applications.
- Risk of unauthorized access without effective controls.

### Hybrid work complications

- Employees require secure access from various locations and devices.
- Consistent enforcement of security policies becomes more difficult.

### Authentication inefficiencies

- Poor authentication processes can disrupt workflows.
- Reduced productivity for both end users and IT teams.

### Balancing security and usability

- IT must implement solutions that ensure:
  - Strong security
  - Regulatory compliance
  - Operational efficiency
  - User convenience
