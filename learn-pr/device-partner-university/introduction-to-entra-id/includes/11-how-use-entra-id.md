This section outlines setup procedures for Microsoft Entra ID features, organized by entity type for clarity:

- Organizations
- Users
- Groups

## Directions for organizations

Organizations can sign up for Microsoft Entra ID or a new Azure subscription using either a personal Microsoft account or a work or school account.

- A personal Microsoft account provides access to consumer-oriented Microsoft services such as Outlook and Microsoft 365.
- A work or school account enables access to enterprise-grade Microsoft cloud services.

After an organization [signs up for one of these services](entra/fundamentals/sign-up-organization), Microsoft Entra ID automatically provisions a cloud-based directory that represents the organization. This directory serves as the foundation for identity and access management across Microsoft services.

- [Associate or add an Azure subscription](entra/fundamentals/how-subscriptions-associated-directory)

## Directions for users

In Microsoft Entra ID, all users are assigned a baseline set of permissions. A user's access is determined by their user type, assigned roles, and ownership of specific directory objects.

Default permissions vary depending on whether the user is a native member of the tenant (member user) or a user invited from another directory, such as a B2B collaboration guest (guest user).

For more information, refer to the documentation on [member and guest users](entra/fundamentals/users-default-permissions)[how to restrict guest permissions](entra/identity/users/users-restrict-guest-permissions).

- [Assign or remove licenses from users](entra/fundamentals/license-users-groups)

- [Restore or remove a deleted user](entra/fundamentals/users-restore)

## Directions for groups

Microsoft Entra groups are used to manage collections of users who require the same access permissions to organizational resources, such as restricted applications and services. Group-based access management allows resource owners or Entra directory administrators to assign a consistent set of permissions to all members of a group.

Administrators can also delegate group membership management to designated individuals, such as department managers or help desk personnel. These delegated users can add or remove group members as needed.

For detailed guidance on managing group ownership, refer to the [Manage groups](entra/fundamentals/how-to-manage-groups) documentation.
