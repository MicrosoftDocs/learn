Zero Trust is an increasingly adopted security framework that assumes no implicit trust for any user, device, or application—regardless of location—and requires continuous verification for access to resources.

To illustrate the significance of this shift, the U.S. government issued an executive order mandating federal agencies to enhance their cybersecurity posture through the implementation of Zero Trust architecture.

This approach isn't limited to U.S. federal entities; it's becoming a global standard for both public and private sector organizations seeking to mitigate modern cyberthreats.

By adopting Zero Trust principles, organizations can strengthen their defenses against evolving security risks. Microsoft Entra ID supports Zero Trust strategies by enabling secure identity and access management across distributed environments.

> Microsoft Entra ID applies a Zero Trust model to identity and access management. Under this model, organizations shift from a trust-by-default approach to a trust-by-exception framework.

> Entra ID doesn't inherently trust any user or device, regardless of their network location. Instead, it continuously evaluates each access request, treating all requests as originating from an untrusted source.

> This approach ensures that only verified users and devices are granted access to sensitive resources, thereby reducing the likelihood of unauthorized access and data breaches.
