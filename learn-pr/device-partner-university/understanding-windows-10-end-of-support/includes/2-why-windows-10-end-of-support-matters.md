Many individuals still rely on Windows 10. Once support ends, these systems will stop receiving security updates and technical support—leaving them vulnerable to modern threats. This module will help you prepare to support informed upgrade decisions.

Understand the difference: End of Support vs. End of Service

- **End of support (EOS)** is the final deadline for Windows 10 support. After this date, Microsoft stops releasing updates, security patches, and technical help.
- **End of service** refers to when specific versions of Windows stop receiving updates. This happens throughout a product lifecycle, but it doesn’t mean the entire OS is unsupported.

Understanding this distinction is key to helping yourself to make informed decisions about upgrading.

It’s easy to misunderstand what "End of Support" (EOS) really means. You might think updates will still arrive or that there's no rush to act because your device seems fine. This section clears up those assumptions and helps you understand why timely action matters.
