Modernizing your organization's device infrastructure is essential for maintaining security, performance, and manageability in today’s hybrid and AI-driven work environments. Windows 11 Pro, paired with Surface devices, offers a platform designed to support modern productivity, cloud-based management, and advanced security features.

## Enhanced security from chip to cloud

Security is a top priority for modern organizations. Windows 11 Pro and Surface devices offer built-in protections that span hardware, firmware, and software layers—helping IT teams implement Zero Trust principles and safeguard sensitive data.

## Windows 11 security features

- **Secured-core PCs**: Surface devices integrate hardware, firmware, and OS protections to defend against advanced threats.
- **TPM 2.0 and BitLocker**: Hardware-based encryption helps protect data and enforce compliance.
- **Windows Hello for Business**: Enables secure, passwordless authentication using biometrics.
- **Virtualization-based security (VBS)** and **Smart App Control**: Isolate critical processes and block untrusted applications.

> [!NOTE]  
> Surface for Business devices with secured-core capabilities provides additional defense against firmware-level attacks and support remote management of UEFI settings via DFCI.

## Streamlined IT management

Managing devices across a distributed workforce can be complex. Windows 11 Pro and Surface simplify this with modern tools that automate deployment, updates, and policy enforcement.

## Management tools

- **Windows Autopilot**: Enables zero-touch provisioning for new devices.
- **Microsoft Intune**: Provides centralized cloud-based device configuration and policy management.
- **Windows Autopatch**: Automates updates for Windows, Microsoft 365 Apps, and firmware.
- **Surface Management Portal**: Offers real-time insights into device health, firmware status, and compliance.

| **Task** | **Modern approach** | **Benefit** |
|---------|---------------------|-------------|
| Deployment | Windows Autopilot | Faster rollouts and consistent configuration |
| Policy enforcement | Microsoft Intune | Unified management across devices |
| Updates | Windows Autopatch | Reduced manual effort and downtime |
| Monitoring | Surface Management Portal | Centralized visibility and firmware control |

> [!TIP]  
> Integrating Surface Management Portal with Intune allows IT admins to monitor firmware status, warranty information, and compliance across all managed Surface devices.

## Productivity built for the AI era

Windows 11 Pro and Surface devices are designed to support modern workstyles and AI-enhanced experiences. From collaboration tools to performance optimization, these technologies help users stay productive and engaged.

## Productivity features

- **Microsoft Copilot**: AI-powered assistance integrated into Windows and Microsoft 365.
- **Windows Studio Effects**: Enhances video calls with features like background blur and eye contact correction.
- **Recall (preview)** (on supported devices): Enables users to find past content and context quickly.
- **Adaptive input**: Touch, pen, and voice support on Surface devices enhances flexibility.
- **Modern standby**: Faster wake and resume times improve responsiveness.

> [!NOTE]  
> Surface for Business devices with Neural Processing Units (NPUs) unlocks hardware-accelerated AI features, improving performance and user experience in hybrid work scenarios.
