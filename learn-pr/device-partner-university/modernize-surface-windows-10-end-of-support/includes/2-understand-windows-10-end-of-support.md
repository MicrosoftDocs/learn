Windows 10 has officially reached end of support, ending regular security updates, bug fixes, and technical assistance from Microsoft. Devices running Windows 10 will continue to operate, but without ongoing updates, they become increasingly vulnerable to security risks and compliance issues.

For IT professionals, this represents a critical inflection point. Upgrading to Windows 11 Pro—and modernizing hardware with Surface devices—ensures continued protection, reliability, and access to the latest productivity and AI features. Surface devices are optimized for Windows 11 and built with chip-to-cloud security, making them a strong foundation for organizations moving beyond Windows 10. 

Organizations that delay upgrading face growing exposure to threats, reduced productivity, and potential compatibility issues with modern applications and services.

## Why upgrade now

With support for Windows 10 officially ended, continuing to use legacy devices increases exposure to security risks, compliance gaps, and system instability. Upgrading to Windows 11 Pro helps reduce these risks while enabling organizations to modernize and streamline IT operations.

The following table highlights key differences between Windows 10 post-EOS and Windows 11 Pro:

| **Windows 10 (Post-EOS)** | **Windows 11 Pro (Next step)** |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------|
| ❌ No more security updates | ✅ Continuous chip-to-cloud protection |
| ❌ No new bug fixes or patches | ✅ Regular reliability and performance updates |
| ❌ No technical support | ✅ Dedicated support and management resources |
| ❌ Increased vulnerability & compliance risk | ✅ Zero Trust security and hardware-based protection |
| ❌ Rising maintenance costs | ✅ Simplified management and lower total cost of ownership |

## What changes with Windows 11 Pro

Upgrading to Windows 11 Pro provides access to:

- AI-powered productivity features such as Microsoft Copilot and Windows Studio Effects  
- Built-in chip-to-cloud security, including secured-core PCs and TPM 2.0  
- Modern management tools like Microsoft Intune, Windows Autopilot, and Windows Autopatch

Modern work environments require modern protection. With Windows 10 no longer supported, continuing to use outdated devices introduces unnecessary risk.

While Windows 10 devices may still function, they no longer receive essential security updates, technical support, or compatibility enhancements available on Windows 11 Pro devices. This gap increases exposure to threats such as malware, phishing, and operational disruptions.

## Outdated PCs, higher risks

Unsupported Windows 10 devices present several challenges:

- Less secure and harder to defend  
- More expensive to maintain  
- Vulnerable to modern cyber threats  

| **Risk area** | **Impact on Windows 10 devices** | **Benefit with Windows 11 Pro** |
|---------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Security | No new patches for vulnerabilities | Regular updates and built-in protections |
| Productivity | Slower performance and downtime | Faster, more reliable experiences |
| IT Costs | More manual maintenance | Streamlined management and automation |

## Windows 11 built-in security

Windows 11 Pro devices help organizations stay ahead of evolving threats with the latest security updates and hardware-backed protection enabled by default.

Key security features include:

- Trusted Platform Module (TPM) 2.0  
- Windows Hello for Business  
- Virtualization-based Security (VBS)  
- Smart App Control  

> [!NOTE]  
> Surface for Business devices ship with Windows 11 Pro and secured-core capabilities out of the box, offering additional protection through chip-to-cloud integration and [DFCI firmware control](/autopilot/dfci-management).

## Recommended actions for IT teams

To maintain a secure, efficient, and productive environment, IT leaders should:

- **Upgrade to Windows 11 Pro** to ensure continued security updates, feature improvements, and Microsoft 365 compatibility.  
- **Assess device eligibility** using tools like [PC Health Check](https://support.microsoft.com/windows/how-to-use-the-pc-health-check-app-9c8abd9b-03ba-4e67-81ef-36f37caa7844) or [Endpoint Analytics](/intune/analytics/?h) where hardware doesn’t meet Windows 11 standards—consider Surface devices to simplify deployment and enable modern AI experiences.  
- **Leverage Microsoft deployment resources**, including [Microsoft Intune](/mem/intune/fundamentals/what-is-intune), [Windows Autopilot](/autopilot/windows-autopilot), and [FastTrack](/microsoft-365/fasttrack/introduction#what-is-fasttrack-for-microsoft-365) for guided migration support.
- **Use temporary bridge solutions** through the [Extended Security Updates](/windows/whats-new/extended-security-updates) program for certain editions of Windows 10. This provides temporary protection while transitioning to Windows 11, but it should be used only as a short-term bridge, not a long-term solution.

Windows 10 end of support introduces significant risks for organizations that continue to rely on outdated devices. By upgrading to Windows 11 Pro and modernizing with Surface, IT teams can strengthen security, reduce maintenance costs, and prepare for the future of AI-enabled work. Microsoft provides a range of tools and resources to support this transition, helping organizations move forward with confidence.
