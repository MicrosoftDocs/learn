Reading Coach builds reading fluency through personalized reading practice—for students of all abilities. As students read aloud, it offers real-time feedback on pronunciation, syllabification accuracy, and reading progress.

## How does it benefit educators?

Reading Coach enables educators to easily personalize reading practice to meet individual student needs.

Students can use Reading Coach for independent reading practice while at school. This gives teachers more time to meet with groups of students while others work alone.

Reading Coach can also be accessed from home—so educators can assign it as homework to help students maintain their reading progress over school breaks.

### Equity and accessibility

Reading Coach can understand content in over 80 languages—including 14 English dialects. This means students from different language backgrounds can use it with ease.

In addition, Immersive Reader is embedded in Reading Coach for students who need a little extra support.

### Personalized learning

Reading Coach can use AI to create personalized stories for students—taking into account their interests and reading level. This can help foster creativity—and make reading more fun.
