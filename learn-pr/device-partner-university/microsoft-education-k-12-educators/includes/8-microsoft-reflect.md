# Microsoft Reflect

Microsoft Reflect is a well-being app designed to support connection, expression, and learning. With it, students can:

- Build self-awareness and empathy
- Grow their emotional vocabulary
- Identify and navigate their emotions
- Develop a growth mindset

Educators can use Microsoft Reflect to easily set up regular check-ins for students, staff, and families—allowing them to share how they feel about any topic, in any language.

Participants respond by selecting the word that best matches their feeling as represented by the Feelings Monster, a  character that showcases 60 emotions.

Instructors receive valuable insights from these check-ins. They can see at a glance how their audience feels and respond accordingly. This enables educators to cultivate connection, expression, and learning through data-informed conversations—as well as tailor their instruction to better respond to their students’ needs and feelings.

Cultivating social-emotional skills in K-12 schools can lead to a number of benefits:

- A Better school climate
- Greater academic achievement
- Higher engagement in learning
- More consistent attendance
- Reduced bullying
