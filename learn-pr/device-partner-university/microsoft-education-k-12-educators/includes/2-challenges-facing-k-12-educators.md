# Challenges facing K-12 educators

The concept of an educator may seem simple at first—a teacher is a teacher, right? But in reality, educators span all types of different roles, responsibilities, and requirements.

It’s impossible to list all the different kinds of educators out there, but examples include:

- Classroom teachers who stay with the same students all day, teaching all subjects
- Specialized teachers who teach one subject
- Specialists who teach specific skills, like reading, to subsets of students
- Paraprofessionals and other aides

No matter what their role may be, many K-12 educators face similar technological challenges:

## Out of date devices

Many educators and classrooms are equipped with older, outdated devices. These devices may struggle with performance issues—especially with newer applications.

This also means that attempts to use technology in class can quickly turn into an endless troubleshooting session.

## Learning new technology

Even with the right devices, new technology can be a challenge. Not only do educators have to learn how to use it—often with very little time for formal training—but they also need to be able to teach their students how to use it as well.

This can turn into a huge hassle—especially for less technologically literate educators.

## Nonproductive time

Sometimes, students may be distracted by devices in the classroom—especially if they can use them to access outside content.

Other times, educators may find that their school’s security solutions block sites or applications they need—forcing them to spend valuable time finding workarounds.
