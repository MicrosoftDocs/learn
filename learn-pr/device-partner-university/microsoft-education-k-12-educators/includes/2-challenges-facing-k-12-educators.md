The concept of an educator might seem simple at first—a teacher is a teacher, right? But in reality, educators span all types of different roles, responsibilities, and requirements.

It’s impossible to list all the different kinds of educators out there, but examples include:

- Classroom teachers who stay with the same students all day, teaching all subjects
- Specialized teachers who teach one subject
- Specialists who teach specific skills, like reading, to subsets of students
- Para-professionals and other aides

No matter what their role might be, many K-12 educators face similar technological challenges:

## Out of date devices

Many educators and classrooms are equipped with older, outdated devices. These devices might struggle with performance issues—especially with newer applications.

This also means that attempts to use technology in class can quickly turn into an endless troubleshooting session.

## Learning new technology

Even with the right devices, new technology can be a challenge. Not only do educators have to learn how to use it—often with little time for formal training—but they also need to be able to teach their students how to use it as well.

This can turn into a huge hassle—especially for less technologically literate educators.

## Nonproductive time

Sometimes, students might be distracted by devices in the classroom—especially if they can use them to access outside content.

Other times, educators might find that their school’s security solutions block sites or applications they need—forcing them to spend valuable time finding workarounds.
