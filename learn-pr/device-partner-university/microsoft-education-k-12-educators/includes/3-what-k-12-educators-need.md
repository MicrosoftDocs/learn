Microsoft Education solutions are designed to respond to the needs of K-12 educators—no matter what they teach, how they teach, or where they teach.

## Enhanced learning

K-12 educators want technology that enhances student learning—without adding disruptions or distractions.

They want apps and devices that build upon the skills students need to learn—both in school and for the future.

## Equity and accessibility

Equity and accessibility are very important to K-12 educators.

They are looking for solutions that all of their students can use—regardless of their abilities, language background, or technology experience.

## Student safety

K-12 educators want to keep all of their students safe—both in school and online.

They want technology that supports their students’ social-emotional well-being, and that deters behavior like bullying.

## Ease of use

Finally, K-12 educators want technology that is easy to use. They want to be able to help their students when needed.

They want their students to eventually use the technology independently—enabling their classes to be focused on learning, not troubleshooting.

Over the next few units, we’ll take a look at some of the Microsoft tools and features that make K-12 education easier and more equitable—and that can help equip students with the skills they’ll need in the future.
