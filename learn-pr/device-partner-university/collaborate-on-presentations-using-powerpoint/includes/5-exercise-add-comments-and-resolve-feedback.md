Feedback is most valuable when it’s clear, visible, and easy to act on. PowerPoint’s commenting tools make this possible by attaching suggestions directly to the slides they relate to. Instead of juggling email threads or side conversations, your team can keep all feedback in one place and track it from discussion to resolution.

In this exercise, you’ll practice using PowerPoint’s commenting tools to leave feedback, tag teammates, and resolve discussions. These steps will help keep collaboration organized and ensure that every idea is captured and addressed.

1. Open the shared presentation

   a. Confirm that the presentation is saved to OneDrive or SharePoint.  
   b. Open the file in PowerPoint to begin collaborating.

2. Insert a comment

   a. Select the text, object, or slide where you want to leave feedback.  
   b. Go to the **Review** tab and click **New Comment**.  
   c. Type your feedback in the comment box.  
   d. Alternatively, right-click on the slide element and choose **New Comment** from the context menu.
