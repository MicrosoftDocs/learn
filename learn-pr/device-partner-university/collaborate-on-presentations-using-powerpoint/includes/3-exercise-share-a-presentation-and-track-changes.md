Collaborating on a PowerPoint presentation is most effective when everyone can access and edit the same file in real time. In this exercise, you’ll practice sharing a presentation using OneDrive or SharePoint, inviting collaborators, and observing how changes are tracked and displayed. This hands-on activity will help you set permissions, monitor edits, and maintain version control—all essential skills for modern teamwork.
