You needed to prepare a presentation and organize project notes while saving time and reducing typing fatigue. Using Surface features and Microsoft 365 Copilot, you were able to draft, refine, and finalize content quickly and collaboratively.

Without these tools, creating polished slides and structured project plans would require more manual effort, slower iterations, and increased risk of missing details. With Copilot and Surface, you can focus on high-value work, improve collaboration, and complete tasks faster—helping you stay productive in a fast-paced business environment.
