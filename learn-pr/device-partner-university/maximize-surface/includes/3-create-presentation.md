### Step 2: Dictate or write your main points
1. Use the Studio Microphone to dictate your slide content.
2. For ideas you want to refine or organize visually, write key points with the Surface Slim Pen 2nd Edition on the first slide.

### Step 3: Use Copilot to generate slides
1. Prompt Copilot with natural language:
*"Create a five-slide presentation for our leadership meeting. Include objectives, key updates, and next steps."*
2. Copilot generates slides based on your prompts.

### Step 4: Annotate and refine slides with Surface Slim Pen 2nd Edition
1. Use the Pen to highlight text or sections.
2. Ask Copilot to rewrite highlighted content for clarity, tone, or conciseness.
3. Repeat until slides match your intended message.

### Step 5: Use touch to rearrange content
- Drag slides or text boxes with your finger or Surface Slim Pen 2nd Edition to adjust flow.
- Highlight sections to have Copilot summarize or create bullet points.

### Step 6: Add finishing touches
1. Use voice commands for quick adjustments:
*"Change the title font to bold and larger size,"* or
*“Summarize slide 3 in a single bullet point.”*
2. Review slides, taking advantage of the high-resolution display to get a clear idea of how they'll present.

***Reflection:** Which combination of Surface Slim Pen 2nd Edition, and Studio Microphone felt most natural for your workflow? How much faster could you complete a presentation compared to typing everything?*
