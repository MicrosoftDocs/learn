Microsoft 365 Copilot is an AI-powered assistant built into apps like Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, and OneNote. Copilot can help you:

- Draft and rewrite text
- Summarize emails, documents, and data
- Generate charts, tables, or slides
- Refine content tone and style

Surface devices enhance this experience with flexible input methods: Pen, touch, voice dictation, and high-resolution displays. These capabilities let you interact naturally with Copilot in ways that suit your workflow.

### How they complement each other

Surface features make Copilot more intuitive and productive:

- Surface Slim Pen: Handwrite notes or annotate slides directly; Copilot can interpret and transform them into polished content.
- PixelSense touchscreen: Highlight, rearrange, or select content seamlessly while Copilot generates outputs.
- Studio Microphone: Dictate content hands-free or give Copilot voice commands. Voice Clarity technology helps make your voice clear and more easily heard.
- High-resolution display: Compare drafts, slides, or notes side by side.

> [!TIP]
> On your Surface device, you can press Win + H to start dictation. Your spoken words are converted into text in apps like Word, PowerPoint, OneNote, or directly into Copilot’s prompt box.

And Copilot helps enhance each Microsoft 365 app:

- PowerPoint: Generate slides from written prompts, restructure content, and refine designs.
- Word: Draft documents, summarize, and polish text.
- Excel: Analyze data, extract insights, and generate charts.
- OneNote: Organize notes, create project outlines, and collaborate with others.

*Reflection: Think about tasks where typing slows you down. How could using Surface Studio Pen and voice input with the Studio Microphone speed up your workflow and reduce fatigue?*
