Microsoft 365 Copilot is your AI assistant. Built into apps like Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, and OneNote, Copilot can help you:

- Draft and rewrite text
- Summarize emails, documents, and data
- Generate charts, tables, or slides
- Refine content tone and style

Surface devices can enhance this experience with flexible input methods: Pen, touch, voice dictation, and high-resolution displays. These capabilities can help you interact naturally with Copilot in ways that suit your workflow.

### How they complement each other

Surface features can help you use Copilot more intuitively:

- Surface Slim Pen 2: Handwrite notes or annotate slides directly; Copilot can help interpret and transform them into polished content.
- PixelSense touchscreen: Can help you highlight, rearrange, or select content while using Copilot.
- Studio Microphone: Dictate content hands-free or give Copilot voice commands. Voice Clarity technology can help make your voice more easily heard.
- PixelSense display: Can help you compare drafts, slides, or notes side by side.

> [!TIP]
> On your Surface device, you can press Win + H to start dictation. Your spoken words are converted into text in apps like Word, PowerPoint, OneNote, or directly into Copilot’s prompt box.

And Copilot can help enhance each Microsoft 365 app:

- PowerPoint: Generate slides from written prompts, restructure content, and refine designs.
- Word: Draft documents, summarize, and polish text.
- Excel: Analyze data, extract insights, and generate charts.
- OneNote: Organize notes, create project outlines, and collaborate with others.

*Reflection: Think about tasks where typing slows you down. How might using Surface Slim Pen 2 and voice input with the Studio Microphone help?*
