Work moves fast, and you need tools that help you stay productive, flexible, and focused. Microsoft 365 Copilot on your Surface device helps you accomplish more in less time—whether you’re writing, analyzing data, creating presentations, or collaborating with your team.

Imagine this: You have an important meeting coming up, and you need a polished presentation fast. You were up late preparing, so your hands are already cramping from typing. You’ve also realized that using more natural input methods helps you stay focused and think more clearly. With your Surface device, you can use the Surface Slim Pen 2nd Edition to annotate ideas, the Studio Microphone with Voice Clarity technology to dictate content, and Copilot to quickly generate, summarize, and refine your slides.
