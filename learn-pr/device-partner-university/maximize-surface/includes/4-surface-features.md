Surface devices include features that can help enhance workflows and secure your data:

- **Neural Processing Unit (NPU):** Surface Copilot+ PCs process AI operations on a dedicated processor, so actions like slide generation, text rewriting, and summarization using Copilot can happen faster.
- **Windows Studio Effects:** Includes live captioning, background blur, and noise suppression, which can help with collaborative meetings and presentations.
- **Security features:** Trusted Platform Module 2.0, Windows Hello for Business, and Microsoft Pluton are designed to help protect data and identities.

Using Copilot with Surface can also help support collaboration:

- Share project outlines in OneNote with colleagues in real-time.
- Dictate notes while using Surface Studio Microphone or Surface Headphones.
- Copilot might assist you with meeting notes and follow-up tasks from collaborative calls in Microsoft Teams.

***Reflection:** How might collaboration features—such as live captioning or smart annotations—help improve the clarity of communication within your team?*
