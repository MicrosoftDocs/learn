    choices:
        - content: "Faster typing"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. Copilot doesn't directly increase typing speed but it can enhance productivity using AI and multimodal input."
        - content: "Streamlined productivity with multimodal inputs"
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct. Copilot on Surface devices improves workflow by integrating Surface Slim Pen, touch, and voice input using Studio Microphone for efficiency."
        - content: "More storage space"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. Copilot doesn't affect device storage."
        - content: "Improved battery life"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. Battery performance is unrelated to Copilot's AI productivity features."
  - content: "Which Surface Copilot+ PC feature helps Copilot respond faster to AI tasks?"
    choices:
        - content: "Touchscreen"
          isCorrect: false

        - content: "File encryption"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. Encryption protects files but doesn't directly help in meetings."
        - content: "Power mode"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. Power mode manages device performance, not meeting clarity."
  - content: "What is a recommended way to interact with Copilot efficiently?"
    choices:
        - content: "Use only the keyboard"
          isCorrect: false
