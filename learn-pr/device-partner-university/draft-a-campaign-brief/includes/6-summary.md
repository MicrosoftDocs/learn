Your company is preparing to launch a new productivity app for small business owners, and you needed to create a campaign brief to align your team and drive a successful digital campaign. In this module, you learned how to use Copilot in Word to generate a first draft of the brief, refine its structure and tone, and ensure it included all the essential componentsâ€”such as objectives, audience, channels, budget, and Key Performance Indicators.

Without Copilot, creating a campaign brief can be time-consuming and inconsistent, often requiring multiple revisions and input from several stakeholders. By using Copilot in Word, you can streamline the process, reduce back-and-forth, and produce a clear, actionable brief faster. This not only saves time but also improves alignment across teams, leading to more efficient campaign execution.
