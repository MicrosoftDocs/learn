There are many places you can interact with Copilot in Word.

- **Copilot prompt box.** This first appears at the top of a blank document, and then appears inline as you write. You can also access it by pressing <kbd>ALT</kbd>+<kbd>i</kbd>.

In the Copilot prompt box above the document, use natural language to ask Copilot to write a campaign brief for a new product. You can use <kbd>ALT</kbd>+<kbd>ENTER</kbd> to add a new line, and you can copy and paste your information about the product into the prompt.

If you want Copilot to rewrite a section, you can do the following:

- Highlight the text to be changed.
- Select the pencil icon that appears in the margin.
- Select **Auto rewrite**.

You can also provide suggestions to Copilot on how to change the rewrites before accepting one.

While in the Rewrite with Copilot experience, select the box that says **What do you want Copilot to change?**

:::image type="content" border="true" source="../media/make-changes-with-copilot.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the location of the What do you want Copilot to change prompt in Microsoft Word.":::

You can then enter in your criteria. Try asking Copilot to:

- Make the tone more professional.
- Simplify the language.
- Add more details.

Copilot will integrate your requests into the rewrites and provide you with new copy to review.
