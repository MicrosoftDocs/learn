Before diving into technical details, it’s important to recognize that Copilot+ PCs represent a shift—not just in performance, **but in how security is designed and delivered**. These devices are not just an evolution; they mark a revolution in personal computing.

With Copilot+ PCs, security isn’t an afterthought. **It’s embedded at every level, from the silicon up to the operating system and AI experiences**.

## Built for the new AI era

Copilot+ PCs are the fastest, most intelligent Windows PCs ever built—purposefully engineered for the AI-powered workplace. Each device features a dedicated Neural Processing Unit (NPU) capable of delivering over 40 trillion operations per second (TOPS). This enables advanced AI workloads to run locally on the device, unlocking real-time responsiveness, lower latency, and reduced reliance on the cloud.

This on-device AI processing model brings two major benefits: performance and privacy. Sensitive business data stays local, minimizing risk of exposure while boosting productivity. With Copilot+ PCs, **your organization can confidently adopt the latest AI experiences—knowing that data stays protected and your teams can move faster with secure, intelligent tools at their fingertips**.

## Security that evolves with you

Every Windows 11 Pro PC is built on a foundation of powerful security and productivity. But as the workplace evolves, so does Windows. Copilot+ PCs represent the next leap forward—combining the best of Windows 11 Pro with AI-optimized hardware, enhanced protections, and new experiences designed for today’s demands.

### Windows 11 Pro PCs:
