Copilot+ PCs are designed to enhance productivity without compromising trust. That means putting control in the hands of users—**and giving organizations the tools to manage that control at scale**.

From Microsoft 365 Copilot with commercial data protection to Recall’s on-device snapshots, every AI-powered experience is built on a foundation of transparency, security, and respect for personal and organizational boundaries.

Next let's explore how Recall is thoughtfully designed to give users ownership over their data—while enabling IT to maintain compliance and safeguard business information.

## Privacy, safety, and Recall

Recall is designed with privacy, transparency, and user control at its core—and it's **disabled by default on commercial devices**.

During setup of a Copilot+ PC, **IT administrators** must first enable Recall before employees have the option to opt in. If Recall is not actively turned on, it remains off. This dual-layer approach ensures that **employees retain control over whether and when they use Recall’s AI-powered timeline**.

### Local-only snapshots

Recall takes snapshots of the screen every few seconds—but these are stored **locally** and processed **entirely on the device**. The AI powering Recall never sends data to Microsoft or the cloud. Snapshots:

- Are stored locally
- Are **not shared with Microsoft or third parties**
- **Aren’t accessible** to other users on the same device
- Are **never used to train AI models**

### Security with Windows Hello

To use Recall, Windows Hello Enhanced Sign-in Security must be enabled. This includes:

- **Proof of presence**: Recall timeline and search can only be accessed when the user is physically present.
- **Just-in-time decryption**: Snapshots are encrypted and only decrypted at the moment of user access.

IT admins also **can’t view other users’ snapshots** due to per-user encryption.

### Transparency and control

Users always know when Recall is active:

- The Recall icon appears on the desktop taskbar
- A system tray icon shows when snapshots are being saved

Users can **pause or filter** what Recall saves at any time. Controls include:

- Pausing or turning off snapshot capture
- Blocking specific apps or websites from being included
- Deleting individual snapshots or all of them

### Built-in privacy boundaries

Recall is designed to respect sensitive content by automatically **excluding**:

- InPrivate browsing sessions (in supported browsers)
- Digital Rights Management (DRM) protected content

These safeguards help users feel confident and in control when using Recall.
