Beyond Recall, Copilot+ PCs are built to bring the power of AI to everyday tasks—securely and responsibly. [Microsoft 365 Copilot](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/copilot/enterprise?msockid=2600a68726456a7030cfb26d27b46b1e) helps users work smarter across apps and workflows, **while maintaining the high standards of data privacy and security that businesses expect**.

This next section highlights how Microsoft 365 Copilot is designed with enterprise-grade protections, and how IT teams can manage the experience through Microsoft 365 and Intune.

## Copilot with commercial data protection

Microsoft 365 Copilot is built to respect organizational data boundaries—**ensuring enterprise-grade security, privacy, and compliance**.

With commercial data protection enabled:

- **Prompts and responses are not retained**: User interactions aren’t stored or accessible after the session ends.  
- **No Microsoft access to data**: Microsoft doesn’t view prompts or responses.  
- **Data is never used to train the models**: Your business data stays confidential and isn’t used to improve the underlying AI.  

These safeguards ensure that users and organizations can confidently use Microsoft 365 Copilot without compromising security. [Learn more about enterprise data protection with Copilot.](/copilot/microsoft-365/enterprise-data-protection)

- **Enforceable policies**: IT admins can configure and enforce security, data access, and privacy controls.
- **Compliance-first design**: Devices and user experiences remain secure and aligned with company standards.
- **Customizable AI experiences**: Features like Recall can be enabled, restricted, or tailored to meet business needs.

This integrated approach helps **businesses embrace AI while staying in control of their data and compliance posture**.
