Organizations that want to get ahead need to embrace AI—**and Copilot+ PCs are the best place to start**.

With AI operations running directly on the device, businesses gain the ability to create secure, private, and highly productive AI experiences. That means sensitive data stays local, **helping to reduce exposure while unlocking entirely new ways of working**.

Copilot+ PCs empower teams to shape their own AI future—boosting productivity and enabling smarter, faster decisions, all while keeping business information protected.

This is especially true with features like **Recall**, which bring AI-powered memory and search to the forefront—without compromising security.¹

## Recall (preview): Designed for privacy and control

Recall (preview) is a Copilot+ PC feature that helps users quickly find and revisit content they’ve previously viewed on their device—**even if it was days or weeks ago**.

### How Recall works

Recall periodically captures snapshots of activity on the device and stores them securely on that same device. These snapshots are only accessible to the signed-in user and can be searched using natural language, making it fast and intuitive to find what’s needed.

### Key privacy protections

- **Data stays local**: Snapshots are stored only on the device and are never shared with Microsoft or anyone else.
- **User-controlled**: Users can pause, filter, or delete snapshots at any time within Settings.
- **Encrypted and secure**: All Recall data is protected with BitLocker encryption and tied to the signed-in user profile.

With Recall, Copilot+ PCs deliver a productivity boost while honoring the privacy standards businesses demand. [Learn more about Recall.](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/retrace-your-steps-with-recall-aa03f8a0-a78b-4b3e-b0a1-2eb8ac48701c)

These principles are crucial for organizations looking to secure hybrid work environments.
