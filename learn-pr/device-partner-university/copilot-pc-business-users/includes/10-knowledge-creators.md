Knowledge creators are high-value employees who serve as the driving force behind their organizations' success.

Working in positions such as sales and marketing, they curate insights and develop content used in various applications and channels. Their contributions are instrumental, playing a significant role in business growth and innovation.

## Variable economic conditions

Forward-thinking leaders recognize that we’re in a time of intense business volatility. For example, 57% of global Chief Financial Officers believe company performance has been more volatile over the past year.

What’s more, roughly half expect this trend to continue due to factors like weak demand, economic uncertainty, and inflation.

## Adversity breeds innovation

In an economic climate such as this, competition is fierce. Leaders need employees that will excel beyond ordinary expectations to drive revolutionary advancements for their businesses.

They need employees that want to make a difference, like inventors, agitators, instigators and disrupters—people who are eager to innovate and grow their organizations.

Employees such as these are driven by results—they believe that success is achieved through continuous innovation that can be felt by their customers. They want to support these high-value employees with tools that enable them to do their best work.

## Tasks and responsibilities

Knowledge creators are tasked with a diverse range of responsibilities, including:

- Developing, writing, reviewing, and delivering high-quality content quickly to meet strict deadlines.

- Analyzing information to inform strategic, data-driven decisions.

- Searching for pertinent content and information across various files, applications, and data repositories.
