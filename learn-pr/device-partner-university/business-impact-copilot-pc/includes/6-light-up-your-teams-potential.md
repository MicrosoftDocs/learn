## From idea to impact

With its blazing performance, Copilot+ PCs empowers teams to respond dynamically to business needs with speed, agility, and innovation. Let's walk through an example that showcases how Copilot+ PCs can transform the way you work and can contribute to organizational success.

## Scenario

Picture yourself in a growing organization. The company's leadership aims to increase market share by expanding operations into new geographical areas. Your responsibility is to form a cross-functional team with leaders from marketing, finance, and sales to develop a comprehensive plan for achieving this objective. You break down the assignment into three key phases, as follows:

- Research and content creation
- Collaboration
- Delivery and impact

Let's explore these three different phases and how Copilot+ PC can help in completing the assigned task:

- **Research and content creation**: As you begin your research, you remember coming across some data that would be helpful for your presentation. Unfortunately, you don't remember what the title was or where to find the file. To help you find it, you prompt Recall (preview): 

_"Find the document that I read two or three weeks ago with Indian demographic information in a pie chart."_

Recall (preview) takes regular 'snapshots' of your screen, which are saved and encrypted locally for your privacy. It can then use the power of the Copilot+ PC's NPU (Neural Processing Unit) to search those snapshots in seconds—ultimately finding the data that you needed. Now that you have what you need, you're ready to start writing your presentation. However, progress is slow—there's a lot of content to cover before the end of the day, yet making progress is challenging. 

Recall (preview) provides helpful suggestions like copy, summarize, ask Copilot, translate, or start an email. These suggestions help make it easier to reach out to your collaborators, work with your resources, and stay focused on the task at hand—creating time to add more impact to your presentation.

- **Collaboration**: Next, it's time to make your presentation to the senior executives. You decide to bring in industry consultants and business development teams from India to provide their regional perspectives. To avoid losing any context, you ask your colleagues from India to present in their native language rather than English.

You use Live Captions to translate their pitch into English. All the attendees on the call receive real-time captions as your colleagues present—so they're able to follow every word. The captions are included with the recording the meeting, so those who missed the presentation can understand as well.

Both you and your colleagues take advantage of Windows Studio Effects on your Copilot+ PCs. By adjusting your Portrait Lighting, you ensure that you're clearly and constantly visible. This helps to connect you with your audience using gestures and facial expressions—ultimately helping you land your important talking points. You also use Windows Studio Effects to ensure that you can easily be heard. With Voice Focus, background noise is eliminated, keeping your audience engaged. They're able to hear you—not the dog barking outside or the construction nearby—so you can get across your points more effectively.

- **Delivery and impact**: The senior executives were impressed with your presentation. They've signed off to expand operations into South Asia and you've secured funding to turn your plan into action. As the project lead, it's your responsibility to email stakeholders with relevant feedback from the senior executives and important action items. With COpilot, you use the following prompt to generate a summary of the presentation meeting: 

_"Recap key takeaways and action items including who's responsible for each meeting on 2/1 at 9 AM titled 'Expansion Plan Sign Off'."_

Key decisions and action items from the presentation are generated after the meeting is over. This allows everyone on the call to focus on the content being shared, with the assurance that it will be available for future reference. With the information you need in hand, all that's left to do is draft the email. This message sets the tone for the project with your stakeholders, so you want to make sure it comes across clearly and professionally. You draft an email using Copilot and select 'Email tone and length':

_"Compose an executive email summarizing the leadership decision made to expand into South Asia, budget support, and key operational steps that the team needs to take within the next month."_

Using Coaching by Copilot, you receive suggestions on how to effectively deliver sensitive information and improve the clarity and tone of your content.
