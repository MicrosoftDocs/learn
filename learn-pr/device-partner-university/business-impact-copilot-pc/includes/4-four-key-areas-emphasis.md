There are four primary ways that Copilot+ PCs enhance business impact. They are: 

- Powerful performance for transformative impact
- Unlock productivity superpowers
- Powerful security designed for AI
- Turbocharge your business impact

Let's explore each of these key areas of emphasis in more detail: 

## Powerful performance for transformative impact

Business success is accelerated with a turbocharged NPU (Neural Processing Unit), for an unmatched experience with lightning speed, smooth performance, and richer AI. Unlike the NPUs found in other Windows 11 PCs, Copilot+ PCs feature NPUs capable of a minimum of 40 TOPS (Trillions of Operations per Second)—making them up to five times faster than the most popular five-year-old Windows PCs still in use today.¹

## Unlock productivity superpowers

With unique AI experiences, you can uncover new opportunities, solve problems faster, and create compelling content. Copilot+ PCs are designed to help you get more done with less work. For instance, you can find something you’ve seen on your Copilot+ PC faster than ever using universal AI-powered Recall (preview). Copilot+ PCs also have the fastest implementation of Microsoft 365 apps.

## Powerful security designed for AI

Copilot+ PCs safeguard your most sensitive information. Like all Windows 11 Pro devices, Copilot+ PCs are designed to be secure from the moment they’re powered on. All Copilot+ PCs are Secured-core PCs and include a Microsoft Pluton security co-processor-providing extra protection for your most sensitive data.

## Turbocharge your business impact

Copilot+ PCs put AI and blazing performance at your service, so your team can respond to business needs with speed, agility, and innovation. Organizations with Copilot+ PCs are on the forefront of AI innovation—with the best power to performance efficiency of any Windows PC and incredible, all day battery life.²

## The power of an NPU

You may wonder why NPUs are so important. Let’s consider the following scenario.

There's a video feed, and you ask an AI tool to identify faces in this feed and count every face that it saw. The NPU, CPU, and GPU can all perform this task. But the NPU is designed to this far more effectively. Because the NPU is a chip that is designed specifically to handle AI workflows, it's able to complete this task faster while generating far less heat and using much less energy. As AI becomes more prevalent, PCs need this functionality to handle ever evolving user demands that rely on AI.

### Disclaimers

1. Tested May 2024 using Cinebench 2024 Multi-Core benchmark comparing Copilot+PCs with Snapdragon X Elite 12 core and Snapdragon X Plus 10 core configurations to a selection of Windows PC models commercially released four to five years ago with the most monthly active use, as determined based on Microsoft internal usage data as of February 2024. Performance varies significantly between device configuration and usage.
