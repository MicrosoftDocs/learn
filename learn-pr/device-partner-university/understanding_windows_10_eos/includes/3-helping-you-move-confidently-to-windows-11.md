Windows 10 end of support isn’t just a deadline—it’s a shift in how you stay secure, productive, and supported in today’s digital world. Windows 11 is built to meet that moment with confidence. 

Let’s look at how it empowers you with smarter performance, stronger protection, and a more modern experience.

### Know what end of support really means

**“Will my PC still get updates after the EOS date?”**  
No. After October 14, 2025, Microsoft will no longer provide free security updates, non-security updates, bug fixes, technical support, or updates to online technical content for Windows 10.

EOS is a **final deadline**, not a gradual phase-out. Acting early helps you stay secure and avoid unnecessary disruptions.

### Check if your device is ready

**“Can my Windows 10 PC upgrade to Windows 11?”**  
Not all devices will qualify. Windows 11 has specific hardware requirements.

Use the [PC Health Check app](https://support.microsoft.com/windows/how-to-use-the-pc-health-check-app-9c8abd9b-03ba-4e67-81ef-36f37caa7844) to see if your PC is compatible. This helps you plan ahead with confidence—whether that means upgrading your current device or exploring new options.

### Windows 11 system requirements

Check these baseline specs to see if your device is ready to upgrade:

- **Processor:** 1 GHz or faster, 2+ cores, 64-bit or SoC  
- **RAM:** 4 GB minimum  
- **Storage:** 64 GB or more  
- **Firmware:** UEFI with Secure Boot  
- **TPM:** Trusted Platform Module (TPM) version 2.0  
- **Graphics:** DirectX 12 or later, WDDM 2.0

### Choose secure, modern solutions

**“Do I really need to upgrade if my PC still works?”**  
Even if your device still functions, unsupported PCs are more vulnerable to threats and won’t keep up with modern features.

Upgrading to a Windows 11 Pro device gives you the latest tools for security, performance, and AI-enhanced productivity—helping you stay focused, protected, and efficient.

If your device doesn’t meet the requirements, explore modern Windows 11 Pro devices designed for today’s work.
