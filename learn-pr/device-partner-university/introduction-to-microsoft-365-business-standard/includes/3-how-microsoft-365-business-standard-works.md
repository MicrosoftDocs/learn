To understand how Microsoft 365 Business Standard works as a whole, imagine you’re a manager at a small business. You’re leading a distributed team working on a client proposal. Team members are located in different regions and need to collaborate efficiently. Microsoft 365 Business Standard provides a set of integrated tools that support communication, document creation, scheduling, and task management throughout the project.

## Communication and coordination with Microsoft Teams

The team uses **Microsoft Teams** to hold virtual meetings and maintain ongoing communication. Channels are created for different workstreams, such as budgeting, research, and design. These channels help organize:

- Conversations
- Shared files
- Meeting recordings

This structure makes it easier to locate relevant information and maintain context.

## Document collaboration

Proposal drafts are created in **Microsoft Word**, where team members coauthor documents in real time. Collaboration is supported through:

- Comments for feedback and discussion
- Tracked changes to monitor edits
- Simultaneous editing to reduce version conflicts
- Session recovery (Word 2024), which automatically restores documents after unexpected shutdowns

>[!NOTE]
> Session recovery in Word 2024 attempts to reopen documents that weren't saved before an unexpected shutdown. However, recovery isn't guaranteed. If you're a Microsoft 365 subscriber, the most reliable way to protect your work is to save files to OneDrive or SharePoint and enable AutoSave, which continuously saves changes in real time.

For budgeting and data analysis, the team uses **Microsoft Excel**. Shared spreadsheets allow contributors to:

- Input and update data
- Build charts and graphs
- Apply formulas and perform calculations
- Use dynamic charts (Excel 2024) that adjust automatically as data changes
- Apply new array and text functions to reshape and analyze data more efficiently

## Presentation development

Team members use **Microsoft PowerPoint** to build the client presentation. Slides are added collaboratively, and the presentation is reviewed and refined together. Integration with Teams allows for:

- Rehearsal sessions
- Real-time feedback
- Version control through shared access
- Use of cameo (PowerPoint 2024) to embed live camera feeds into slides
- Use of Recording Studio to capture voice, ink, and video for asynchronous presentation delivery

>[!NOTE]
> To use Recording Studio effectively, make sure your device has a working camera and microphone. You can preview your setup before recording to check audio levels and framing.

## File storage and access

Project files are stored in **OneDrive**, enabling secure access from any device. OneDrive supports:

- Cloud-based file storage
- Version history for file recovery
- Link-based sharing

A **SharePoint** site is used to organize reference materials and templates. SharePoint allows the team to:

- Centralize project resources
- Manage access permissions
- Maintain structured document libraries

## Scheduling and external coordination

Meetings are scheduled using **Outlook**, and calendar invites are sent to participants. Outlook is also used for:

- Email updates
- Deadline reminders
- Meeting follow-ups
- Improved search capabilities (Outlook 2024) for finding emails and calendar items
- New meeting options to automatically shorten events and create breaks between calls

For external consultations, **Microsoft Bookings** provides a scheduling interface that:

- Displays available time slots
- Sends automatic confirmations
- Reduces manual coordination

## Task management

Tasks and milestones are tracked in **Microsoft Planner**, which allows team members to:

- View assigned tasks and due dates
- Update progress and completion status
- Monitor overall project timelines

The Planner board is accessible within Teams for quick reference during discussions.

## Information retrieval and summarization

Throughout the project, team members use Copilot Chat in Microsoft Teams and Word to interact with content using natural language. This helps reduce time spent searching for information and supports faster decision-making.

Depending on licensing, Copilot Chat offers different levels of functionality:

### Without the Microsoft 365 Copilot add-on license

Users with a standard Microsoft 365 business subscription can use Copilot Chat to work with the content currently open in the app. For example, while editing a proposal in Word, a team member might ask:

> Summarize the key deliverables listed in this document.

Copilot Chat analyzes the open file and responds with something like:

> The document outlines three key deliverables:
>
> - A market analysis report
> - A proposed budget for Q4
> - A client presentation deck

This allows the user to quickly understand the document without reading every section.

### With the Microsoft 365 Copilot add-on license

Users with the add-on license can access broader organizational data, such as emails, meetings, and chats. For example, a team member might ask:

> What decisions were made about the proposal in the last two meetings?

Copilot Chat can then respond with something more specific and detailed, like:

>In the last two meetings, the team agreed to:
>
>- Focus the proposal on mid-sized clients
>- Allocate 20% of the budget to design
>- Schedule the client presentation for October 3rd
>
>These decisions were discussed in meetings held on September 10th and September 13th.

This deeper integration helps users connect information across tools and workstreams.

## Integrated workflow

These tools work together to support a distributed team through all phases of the project—from planning and drafting to presenting and delivering the final proposal. The integration across applications helps maintain continuity and reduces the need to switch between platforms.
