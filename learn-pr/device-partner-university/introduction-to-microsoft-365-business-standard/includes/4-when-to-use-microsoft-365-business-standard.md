You’re a manager at a small business, leading a distributed team tasked with developing a client proposal. Your team members are in different regions and need to collaborate efficiently, share documents, schedule meetings, and manage tasks—all while working remotely.

Depending on your specific needs, Microsoft 365 Business Standard may or may not be your best choice.

## When Microsoft 365 Business Standard is a good fit

Microsoft 365 Business Standard is a strong option for many small to medium-sized organizations (SMBs). Here are situations where it’s likely the best fit:

- **Your team needs to collaborate across locations:** If your team is distributed and needs to share files, hold virtual meetings, and coauthor documents in real time, Microsoft 365 Business Standard provides integrated tools like Microsoft Teams, Microsoft SharePoint, and Microsoft OneDrive.  
- **You want access to both desktop and web Office apps:** Microsoft 365 Business Standard includes full versions of Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, Microsoft PowerPoint, and Microsoft Outlook for both desktop and browser use, allowing flexibility across devices.  
- **You need business-class email and shared calendars:** Microsoft Exchange Online provides professional email hosting and calendar sharing, which supports coordination across teams.  
- **You prefer cloud-based tools with automatic updates:** Microsoft 365 Business Standard is cloud-first, meaning your apps and services are always up to date without manual intervention.  
- **Your organization doesn’t require advanced security or device management:** If basic security features like multifactor authentication and data encryption are sufficient, Microsoft 365 Business Standard covers those needs without the complexity of premium security tools.  
- **You’re managing a team of 300 users or fewer:** Microsoft 365 Business Standard supports up to 300 users, making it ideal for small to medium-sized businesses.  
- **You need task and project coordination tools:** Microsoft Planner and Microsoft Teams integration help teams organize tasks, assign responsibilities, and track progress collaboratively.  

## When another solution may be more appropriate

However, depending on your team’s specific needs, Microsoft 365 Business Standard might not be the best option.

- **Your team needs advanced security or device management:** If your organization requires mobile device management, data classification, or protection against threats, Microsoft 365 Business Premium may be more appropriate. It includes Microsoft Intune and Azure Information Protection.  
- **Your organization is larger than a small or medium-sized business:** Microsoft 365 Business Standard supports up to 300 users. If your team exceeds that limit or has complex IT infrastructure, Microsoft 365 Enterprise may be more appropriate.  
- **You operate in a regulated industry with strict compliance requirements:** For teams that need tools like eDiscovery, legal hold, or advanced auditing, Microsoft 365 Enterprise provides the necessary compliance features.  
- **You rely on hybrid Exchange deployments:** Microsoft 365 Business Standard includes Microsoft Exchange Online only. If your organization uses or plans to use a hybrid Exchange setup, Microsoft 365 Enterprise is required.  
- **You need advanced features in Microsoft Teams or Microsoft SharePoint:** Some capabilities—such as advanced analytics, compliance integrations, or custom app development—are only available in Microsoft 365 Enterprise.  
- **Your team works from a single location and doesn’t need cloud collaboration:** If your team is small, works from one office, and primarily uses Office apps for local document creation and email, Microsoft Office Home & Business may be sufficient. It includes Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, Microsoft PowerPoint, and Microsoft Outlook as a one-time purchase, without cloud services.  
- **You prefer a one-time purchase over a subscription:** For organizations or individuals who want to avoid ongoing subscription costs and don’t need cloud-based features, Microsoft Office Home & Business offers a simpler licensing model.  
- **You don’t need shared storage or real-time co-authoring:** If collaboration is limited to emailing files back and forth, and cloud-based storage isn’t required, Microsoft Office Home & Business may meet your needs without the added complexity of Microsoft 365 services.
