## Lock it and leave it

To help protect your data and privacy, your PC signs you in with Windows Hello and works with presence sensing to lock when you step away. Your PC can also adaptively dim if someone else is detected looking at your display.<sup>17</sup>

## Windows Hello for Business

To protect against credential loss or theft, Windows Hello and Windows Hello for Business enable you to securely sign into your device with your face, fingerprint, or PIN instead of a password. 

Windows Hello for Business now enables IT admins to enforce passwordless authentication by removing the password sign-in option on devices. Additionally, Windows Hello has a new look and integration with multiple features including passkeys to provide a more secure, seamless experience.<sup>17</sup>
