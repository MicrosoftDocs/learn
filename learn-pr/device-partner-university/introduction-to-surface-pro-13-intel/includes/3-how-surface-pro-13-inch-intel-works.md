Surface Pro 13-inch (Intel) is a Copilot+ PC that's ideal for AI productivity use cases, business-centric versatility, and portability. Let's get familiar with the hardware of Surface Pro 13-inch (Intel) before you turn it on for the first time.

## Ports and powering on

Let's start on the left side of the device. You'll see two USB-C ports. These ports can handle charging in addition to connecting peripherals—such as monitors, portable hard drives, and docking stations. When first booting up Surface Pro 13-inch (Intel), it's recommended to run through the initial setup with the device plugged in. On the top left corner of the device, you'll see a power button. This button serves a dual purpose: to power the device and to lock the screen while your Surface Pro 13-inch (Intel) is powered on.

On the right side of the device, you'll see the Surface Connect port. This port supports fast charging with a minimum of 60 W. These charging speeds are also available when charging via USB-C ports (USB-C chargers are sold separately).

On the front of the device, you'll see the Quad HD front-facing Surface Studio Camera that features 1440p resolution with an ultrawide field of view. This webcam has support for Windows Studio Effects with automatic framing, portrait blur, creative filters, eye contact, and background blue. This is the primary way that you capture video for virtual meetings through apps such as Microsoft Teams.

Next to the Surface Studio Camera is a secondary Windows Hello camera. This sensor enables Surface Pro 13-inch (Intel) to support secure sign-in authentication via facial recognition using Windows Hello for Business with Enhanced Sign-in Security. When set up, your Surface Pro 13-inch (Intel) will scan your face and securely sign into your Surface Pro when you press the power button.

Once you power on the Surface Pro 13-inch (Intel), you can quickly set it up and start working. Start by selecting your language, then connecting to your local network. Once the basics are set up, sign-in to your Microsoft Account. Doing this allows you to sync files and data across devices. Logging in to your account will also automatically sign you into native applications like Microsoft Edge.

After your account is synchronized, you'll have the option to set up biometric unlocking through Windows Hello to keep your device secure, importing settings from previous devices with your Microsoft Account backup, and finally setting up privacy settings. And now your Surface Pro 13-inch (Intel) is ready to be used.

To set up Windows Hello follow these steps:

1. Open **Settings**.
2. Then select **Accounts**.
3. Choose **Sign-in options**.
4. Select **Facial recognition (Windows Hello)**.
5. Select **Set up**.
