## Recall (preview)

Imagine you're working on an important presentation. You remember stumbling across a chart that would be great for a slide, but you forgot where you saw it. In the past, this meant digging through your browser history in the hopes of finding the right page.

:::image type="content" border="true" source="../media/using-recall.gif" alt-text="GIF of using Recall to find a file using natural language.":::

With Recall (preview) on Surface Pro 13-inch (Intel), you can use an explorable timeline to find the content you remember seeing before. Using semantic powered search, simply describe how you remember something, and Recall (preview) will retrieve the moment you saw it. Any photo, link, or message can be a fresh point to continue from.

>[!NOTE]
> To use Recall (preview), you need to opt in to saving snapshots, which are screenshots of your activity. Snapshots and the contextual information derived from them are saved and encrypted to your local hard drive. Recall (preview) doesn't share snapshots or associated data with Microsoft or third parties, nor is it shared between different Windows users on the same device.

If you opt into using Recall (preview), then as you use your PC, a snapshot of your active screen will be saved every few seconds and when the content of your active window changes. Snapshots are also protected with Windows Hello, so that only the signed in user can access their Recall (preview) content.

To use Recall (preview) your Surface Pro 13-inch (Intel) must meet the following requirements:

- At least 50GB of storage space free
- Device Encryption or BitLocker enabled
- Enrolled into Windows Hello Enhanced Sign-in Security with at least one biometric sign-in option enabled in order to authenticate

Recall (preview) supports multiple browsers, and their capabilities include:

- **Microsoft Edge:** filters specified websites and filters private browsing activity
- **Firefox:** filters specified websites and filters private browsing activity
- **Opera:** filters specified websites and filters private browsing activity
- **Google Chrome:** filters specified websites and filters private browsing activity
- **Chromium based browsers (124 or later):** for Chromium-based browsers not listed above, filters private browsing activity only, doesn't filter specific websites

To open Recall (preview), use the keyboard shortcut **Windows Key + J**, by selecting Recall from **Start > All Apps**, or select the Recall icon on your taskbar.

>[!NOTE]
> Every time you launch Recall (preview) or change Recall (preview) settings, you are asked to confirm that it's you by using Windows Hello. Your saved snapshots and any associated information are encrypted so that only you can access them.

Once you've confirmed your identity, you're taken to your Recall (preview) homepage. As you use your Surface Pro 13-inch (Intel), your homepage tailors itself to you based on your recent snapshots and apps you used.

If you'd prefer not to have a customized homepage, you can turn off the feature and only have a search bar. Here's how to turn off this feature:

1. Open **Settings**.
2. Select **Privacy & security**.
3. Then select **Recall & snapshots**.
4. Then **Advanced settings**.
5. Click **Off** under *Recall shows a customized experience using your snapshots*.

To review your previous snapshots, select the timeline from Recall's (preview) navigation bar. Your timeline in Recall (preview) is broken into segments, which are the blocks of time that snapshots of your screen are taken while you were using your Surface Pro 13-inch (Intel). You can hover over your timeline to review your activity in a preview window. Selecting the location on the timeline or selecting the preview window loads the snapshot where you can interact with the content.

When searching with Recall (preview), the results are listed under the headings of **text matches** and **visual matches**. Matches that are closer to your search are shown first. You'll also notice that some items are listed as one of the following types of matches:

- **Close match:** Close matches typically include at least one of the search terms or images that are representative of a term in your query.
- **Related match:** Matches that share a commonality with the search terms would be considered related.

You can filter out apps and websites from being saved as snapshots. You can add apps and websites at any time by going to **Settings** > **Privacy & security** > **Recall & snapshots** on your Surface Pro 13-inch (Intel).

If you choose to reset Recall (preview), it deletes all of your snapshots and resets all your settings for Recall (preview). A reset won't delete snapshots you previously exported to a folder, or snapshots that have been shared previously with an app or website, which have been saved by a third party. To reset Recall (preview):

1. Go to **Settings** > **Privacy & security** > **Recall & snapshots** > **Advanced settings**, then select **Reset Recall**.
2. Confirm that you want to delete all your snapshots and reset your Recall (preview) settings by selecting **Reset**.
3. Authorize the reset by using Windows Hello.

## Restyle Image

Restyle Image is a feature in the Microsoft Photos app that lets you reimagine your photos with the help of AI. With this feature you can add original contextual AI-generated styles to your photos by choosing from curated prebuilt options with adjustable creativity levels or by creating a custom style using a text prompt.

Here's how to use Restyle Image:

1. Open any of your photos with the **Microsoft Photos** app.
2. At the top of the **Photos** app, select **Edit image** or use the **Ctrl + E** keyboard shortcut.
3. Select the **Restyle Image** option.
4. You can select one of the preset prompts or enter a custom description. You can also adjust the creativity level.

Restyle Image uses proprietary and open-source AI models that are fine-tuned by Microsoft. It uses a Sketch-to-Image model, using the text prompt you entered or selected to create the style and apply it to your selected photo. If the photo you selected includes prominent faces in the foreground, a separate AI model is used to preserve facial and human characteristics in the photo. If faces are found, the selected style is only applied to the background of the photo—preserving faces from possible distortion.

>[!NOTE]
> Restyle Image is currently optimized for prompts in US English. To use this feature, you must be connected to the internet and signed into your Microsoft account in order to access cloud services that help ensure safe use of AI.
