In this module, you explored how Azure Local addresses the needs of organizations requiring on-premises infrastructure with the flexibility and innovation of the cloud. You learned how Azure Local enables organizations to run virtual machines, containers, and edge workloads locally, while still benefiting from Azure-based management, backup, and monitoring.

You reviewed the key components of Azure Local—including virtualization, software-defined storage, networking, and Azure service integration—and how they work together to deliver a resilient, scalable, and hybrid-ready platform.

Without Azure Local, organizations might face challenges in maintaining control over data, meeting compliance requirements, or managing workloads in disconnected or latency-sensitive environments. By adopting Azure Local, businesses can simplify operations, enhance resiliency, and modernize their infrastructure—all while staying connected to Azure for centralized oversight and automation.
