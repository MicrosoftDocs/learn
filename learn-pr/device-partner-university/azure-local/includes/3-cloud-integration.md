Azure Local offers deep integration with Azure, extending cloud capabilities to your on-premises environment.

## How cloud integration works

- Azure Arc connects local servers to Azure, enabling cloud-based monitoring, security, and automation.
- Workloads can be backed up to Azure, monitored with Azure Monitor, and restored with Azure Site Recovery.
- You can manage and update multiple locations from a single Azure dashboard.

### Benefits of cloud integration

- Centralized control over distributed environments.
- Faster recovery and simplified compliance.
- Scalable operations for growing infrastructure.
- Hybrid cloud flexibility, allowing workloads to run where they perform best.

## Application Support

Azure Local supports both traditional and modern workloads:

- **Virtual Machines**: Host core business applications, file servers, domain controllers, and more.
- **Containers**: Run microservices or lightweight applications using Kubernetes (Azure Kubernetes Service).
- **Custom Workloads**: Build and deploy industry-specific solutions like manufacturing control systems, hospital management software, or financial apps.

Applications can interface with existing hardware and systems while benefiting from cloud-based management and protection.
