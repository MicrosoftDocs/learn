With Azure Local, you now deliver secure, modern healthcare services, meet regulatory requirements, and empower staff with reliable, cloud-integrated ITâ€”without compromising on data residency or operational control.

Azure Local provides a unified platform for running virtual machines, containers, and cloud services on validated hardware, supporting both Windows and Linux workloads. It integrates with Azure Arc to enable centralized management, monitoring, backup, disaster recovery, and policy enforcement. Administrators can organize resources using tags and resource groups, automate updates with Azure Update Manager, and manage infrastructure through familiar tools like Windows Admin Center and PowerShell.

In this module, you explored:

- Support for Azure Kubernetes Service enabled by Azure Arc, allowing deployment and management of containerized applications across on-premises and remote environments
- Multi-layered security protections such as Secured-core servers, TPM 2.0, BitLocker, Credential Guard, and Zero Trust principles
- Integration with Microsoft Defender and Microsoft Sentinel for threat detection and compliance
- Over 300 security settings enabled by default
- Enforcement of multifactor authentication for resource management actions
