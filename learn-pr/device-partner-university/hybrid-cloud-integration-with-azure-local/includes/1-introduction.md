Imagine you’re leading IT for a regional healthcare provider with multiple clinics and a central hospital. You face strict data residency and compliance requirements for patient records, and you need to modernize your infrastructure to support new digital health initiatives.

Your legacy servers are costly to maintain and don’t support modern workloads like virtual desktops for remote staff or AI-powered diagnostics. You need to keep sensitive data on-premises, but you also want the flexibility and scalability of the cloud.

In this module, you’ll explore how Azure Local can help you meet these challenges. You’ll learn how to use hybrid cloud integration, centralized management, advanced security, and modern application platforms to deliver secure, reliable, and innovative healthcare IT—while maintaining full control over your sensitive data and compliance obligations.

## Learning objectives
