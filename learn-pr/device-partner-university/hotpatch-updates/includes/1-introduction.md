Keeping devices secure is a constant priority for IT administrators, but applying updates often means scheduling restarts that interrupt work. Hotpatch updates provide the latest way to apply security patches faster, with fewer restarts and less downtime, all while maintaining security and compliance. Hotpatching is available for Windows 11 Enterprise, version 24H2 and later, as well as Windows Server 2022 (Azure Edition) and Windows Server 2025 (Azure Edition and on-premises via Azure Arc).

This module explains how hotpatching works, when it applies, and how it fits into existing update processes. You’ll learn how hotpatch updates are deployed through Windows Autopatch, what prerequisites are required, and how this approach helps organizations maintain their security posture more quickly.

## Learning objectives

By the end of this module, you’ll be able to:

- Configure a Windows quality update policy to enable hotpatching through Windows Autopatch
- Identify prerequisites and device requirements for hotpatching
- Describe what hotpatch updates are and how they function
