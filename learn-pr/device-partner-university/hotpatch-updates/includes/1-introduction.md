Keeping devices secure is a constant priority for IT administrators, but applying updates often means scheduling restarts that can interrupt work. Hotpatch updates for Windows 11 Enterprise, version 24H2, introduce a new way to apply security patches without requiring a reboot, reducing downtime while maintaining protection.

This module explains how hotpatching works, when it applies, and how it fits into existing update processes. You’ll learn how hotpatch updates are deployed through Windows Autopatch, what prerequisites are required, and how this approach helps organizations maintain strong security with fewer restarts.

## Learning objectives

By the end of this module, you’ll be able to:

- Configure a Windows quality update policy to enable hotpatching through Windows Autopatch
- Identify prerequisites and device requirements for hotpatching
- Describe what hotpatch updates are and how they function
