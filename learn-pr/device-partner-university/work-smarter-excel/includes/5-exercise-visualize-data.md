In this exercise, you’ll practice using Copilot Chat to summarize data and create visualizations. By the end, you’ll be able to generate pivot tables, charts, and text-based summaries, refine them using follow-up instructions, and present insights clearly.

## Steps

**1. Open your workbook**

Open the Excel workbook containing the sales dataset you used in Exercise 1. Make sure it includes columns for **Product**, **Region**, **Quarter**, **Quantity**, and **Revenue**. If needed, you can copy the table provided:

| Product  | Region | Quarter | Quantity | Unit Price | Revenue |
|----------|--------|---------|----------|------------|---------|
| Alpha    | North  | Q1      | 10       | 25         | 250     |
| Beta     | South  | Q1      | 8        | 40         | 320     |
| Gamma    | East   | Q1      | 15       | 12         | 180     |
| Delta    | West   | Q1      | 5        | 100        | 500     |
| Epsilon  | North  | Q2      | 20       | 8          | 160     |
| Zeta     | South  | Q2      | 12       | 18         | 216     |
| Eta      | East   | Q2      | 7        | 50         | 350     |
| Theta    | West   | Q2      | 25       | 6          | 150     |
| Iota     | North  | Q3      | 30       | 4          | 120     |
| Kappa    | South  | Q3      | 14       | 22         | 308     |
| Lambda   | East   | Q3      | 9        | 35         | 315     |
| Mu       | West   | Q3      | 18       | 15         | 270     |

**2. Open Copilot Chat**

Access Copilot Chat from the Excel ribbon, sidebar, or sparkle icon by a selected cell.

**3. Generate a pivot table**

In the chat box, type:

*"Create a pivot table showing total revenue by product and quarter."*
Copilot generates the pivot table and provide it to you. You can then copy and paste it into a worksheet. Check that the pivot table lists the correct products, quarters, and revenue values.

**4. Create a chart**

With the pivot table selected, ask Copilot:

*"Create a column chart comparing total revenue for each product across all quarters."*
Copilot provides a column chart for you to copy and paste. You can move or resize it as needed.

**5. Refine the visualization**

Ask Copilot follow-up questions to improve clarity:

- *"Add data labels to the chart."*

- *"Change the bar chart colors to match my theme."*

- *"Filter the bar chart to show only the top five products."*

**6. Generate a text-based summary**

Ask Copilot:

*"Summarize the top three products by total sales and highlight any trends."*
Copilot provides a concise written summary that you can insert into your report.
