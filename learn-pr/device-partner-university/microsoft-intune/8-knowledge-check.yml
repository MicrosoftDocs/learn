    choices:
        - content: "Using Microsoft Edge"

        - content: "Through the Windows Store"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. The Windows Store itself doesn't support MAM. On Windows, MAM is only supported via Microsoft Edge."
        - content: "Via Microsoft Teams"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. Microsoft Teams doesn't support MAM on Windows; only Microsoft Edge supports it for now."
        - content: "By installing a non-Microsoft app"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. Intune doesn't use non-Microsoft apps for MAM on Windows. MAM is currently supported only through Microsoft Edge."

        - content: "They allow selective wiping of corporate data from managed apps"
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct. APP enables selective wiping of corporate data from managed apps, especially useful if a device is lost or an employee leaves."
        - content: "They provide unlimited admin rights to all users"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. APP is focused on data protection, not user privileges."
        - content: "They only work on company-owned devices"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. APP can protect data on both managed (company-owned) and unmanaged (personal) devices."

    choices:
        - content: "Add the app to Intune"
