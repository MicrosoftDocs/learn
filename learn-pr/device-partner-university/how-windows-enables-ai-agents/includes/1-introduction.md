AI is no longer confined to individual apps — it’s becoming part of the operating system itself. Windows is evolving from a traditional OS into a foundation for intelligent assistants, agents, and AI-powered workflows that help people work more efficiently.

AI has traditionally shown up as something users deliberately launched—through a chatbot, a webpage, or a standalone application. Now that’s changing. Intelligence is being built directly into Windows — into its shell, into system experiences, and into everyday workflows. Instead of being “one more app to open,” AI becomes part of how people use their PCs.

In this module, you’ll explore how Windows is becoming the canvas for AI by integrating intelligence across the operating system, silicon, and hardware. The goal is to help organizations move from experimentation to execution.

## Learning objectives

By the end of this module, you’ll be able to:

- Explain how AI, agents, and Microsoft 365 Copilot are integrated into familiar Windows experiences
- Describe how Copilot+ PCs support advanced on-device AI workloads
- Summarize how Windows is evolving into a platform where people and agents work together
