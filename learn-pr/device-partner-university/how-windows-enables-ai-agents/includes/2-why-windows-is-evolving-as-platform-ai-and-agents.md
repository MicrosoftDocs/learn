Organizations are under constant pressure. IT teams balance security requirements, device management, compliance standards, and user expectations—often with limited staff and increasing demand.

At the same time, AI adoption is accelerating. Users already interact with AI in browsers, productivity tools, and mobile apps. The next logical step is for AI to become part of the operating system itself.

Windows is evolving from a traditional operating system into a foundation for intelligent assistants, agents, and AI-powered workflows. Instead of AI living only inside individual apps, Windows enables people and agents to work together across the entire experience.

This shift represents more than a new feature release—it’s a **change in platform design philosophy**. Windows is still the place where applications run, but it’s also becoming a system that:

- Provides built-in intelligence
- Helps orchestrate workflows
- Assists with everyday tasks
- Supports collaboration between people and agents

Rather than being “another tool to open,” AI becomes part of how users work on their PCs.

## Windows as the canvas for AI and agents

For IT professionals, AI in Windows isn’t simply about new features. It changes how work gets done across the environment.

:::image type="content" source="../media/ai-windows-infographic.svg" alt-text="Infographic showing four areas transformed by AI in Windows: user support with contextual help, device management automation, issue diagnosis using signals and summaries, and scalable onboarding with guided setup.":::

Many familiar pain points show up again and again: repeated “how do I…?” questions, tickets for basic troubleshooting, and multi-step configuration tasks that require hands-on IT involvement. Agents are designed to reduce this repetitive workload and guide users through validated steps directly within Windows.

These changes show up most clearly in everyday IT scenarios.

**A user can’t connect to Wi-Fi.**

Traditionally, they submit a ticket and wait. With built-in agents, the device can walk through diagnostics, reset adapters, and confirm policy—often before a ticket is ever opened.

**A new employee signs in for the first time.**

Instead of step-by-step instructions from IT, policies and apps are automatically applied, and agents can answer questions about VPN, required software, or device setup.

**A device feels slow.**

Rather than guessing or searching online, an agent can gather logs, summarize findings, suggest actions, and when permitted, carry out remediation. That means fewer remote sessions and less time in Event Viewer.

The value is not “AI for AI’s sake.” The value is **fewer repetitive tickets, faster remediation, and more consistent user experiences**—while IT maintains control through policy and governance.

## What AI agents are

Before going deeper into how agents show up in Windows, it helps to define what we mean by an **AI agent**.

An AI agent is an AI-powered tool that can **do work on your behalf**, not just answer questions. While [Microsoft 365 Copilot](/copilot/microsoft-365/microsoft-365-copilot-overview) focuses on conversation, guidance, and suggestions, **agents are designed to take action** — always within the permissions and policies your organization sets.

Put simply:

- Copilot helps you think
- Agents help you do

## How to think about agents

You can think of an AI agent as a **digital teammate**. It can understand intent, reason through multi-step tasks, and take action across apps and services — all while respecting identity, permissions, and organizational policy. Instead of completing every individual step yourself, you describe the outcome you want, and the agent helps carry it out.

## What agents can assist with

Agents are especially useful for tasks that are **repeatable, multi-step, time-consuming, or support-heavy**.

For example, an AI agent could:

- **Gather diagnostics** when an update repeatedly fails
- **Summarize files or folders** to help prepare a brief or report
- **Guide users through setup or troubleshooting** without a ticket right away

In other words, agents don’t just provide answers — they take action under organizational policy, identity, and consent.

## Evolving the Windows platform

Windows isn’t just adding agents—it’s making them part of the OS experience. With **native agent infrastructure**, Windows provides secure agent connectors (preview) and a dedicated agent workspace (preview) to help agents operate safely on devices.

By embedding agent capabilities into core Windows services:

- Copilot and other agents can coordinate tasks across applications, files, and system settings
- Users receive context-aware assistance based on what they’re doing
- IT can set boundaries around what agents are allowed to do

This shift means agents aren’t running “off to the side.” They become first-class participants in the Windows experience, helping coordinate tasks, respond to context, and take policy-driven actions under IT governance.

## Phases of AI evolution in Windows

:::image type="content" source="../media/evolution-of-ai.svg" alt-text="Three phases of AI evolution showing a human with an assistant, human-led agents, and human-led agent-operated workflows.":::

| Phase | Description | What it looks like in practice |
|-------|-------------|--------------------------------|
| **Phase 1 – Human with assistant** | Each user has an AI assistant that helps with everyday tasks | Users ask Copilot questions, draft emails, summarize documents |
| **Phase 2 – Human-led agents** | Agents act as digital teammates that carry out specific tasks at human direction | Agents collect diagnostics, reset services, generate reports, or triage tickets |
| **Phase 3 – Human-led, agent-operated** | People set goals and agents run larger workflows, checking in only when needed | Agents coordinate onboarding steps, apply configuration changes, or resolve known issues end-to-end |

## Bringing agents into your flow

AI is moving into the places where work already happens, not just into separate apps. With experiences such as Ask Copilot (preview) and agents on the Windows Taskbar (preview), assistance shows up in the flow of work instead of requiring users to switch tools.

You can:

- Invoke any agents your organization makes available (first or third party)
- Use quick prompts and monitor progress with familiar UX patterns like hover, badges, and notifications
- Move on to other tasks while your agents work for you

## A more secure and resilient foundation

AI capabilities only matter if the platform beneath them is secure and dependable. Recent Windows advancements focus on strengthening encryption, identity protections, recovery capabilities, and policy-based management. Together, they allow organizations to adopt AI and agents while maintaining control, compliance, and resiliency.

These improvements are designed to support:

- Stronger identity protection
- Modern authentication experiences
- Secure data handling
- Faster device recovery when issues occur

In other words, innovation happens on top of a **secure, governed foundation**.

## Everyday IT challenges AI can help with

Most IT teams recognize the patterns immediately. A user resets their VPN credentials the wrong way and loses access. Someone can’t find the file they swear they saved “yesterday.” Another user says their device is “just slow now,” but there’s no clear error to point to. Updates occasionally fail, onboarding steps get missed, and the question “what changed recently?” comes up more often than anyone would like.

Traditionally, these situations turn into tickets, remote sessions, and manual investigation. Users search online, wait in queues, and IT walks through the same troubleshooting steps over and over again.

With AI and agent capabilities built directly into Windows, these aren’t simply “support incidents” anymore — they become guided workflows. The device itself can help users diagnose issues, gather relevant context for IT, or even resolve common problems automatically before they hit the help desk.

| Situation | Traditional path | With AI + agents in Windows |
|----------|------------------|-----------------------------|
| VPN credentials reset wrong | User loses access → ticket → remote session → manual reset | Agent detects authentication failures and walks the user through the correct reset flow |
| “I can’t find my file” | User searches folders or OneDrive, then submits a ticket | AI helps search by natural language (“budget file from last week with charts”) |
| “My device is slow” | IT gathers logs, Task Manager screenshots, remote sessions | Agent collects signals, summarizes findings, and recommends remediation |
| Failed update | Downtime → troubleshooting → sometimes reimage | Recovery guidance with automated rollback options |
| “What changed recently?” | IT manually checks policy, app installs, and updates | System surfaces recent changes automatically as context |

For example, a salesperson is about to join a customer call and their VPN connection fails. Instead of submitting a ticket and waiting, Windows detects repeated connection errors, launches guided troubleshooting, repairs the profile, and verifies connectivity. The user joins the meeting on time — IT sees the summary afterward instead of an urgent escalation.

That’s the difference: not replacing IT but moving routine fixes closer to the user while preserving auditability and control.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> AI agents do **not** replace IT teams.  
> They reduce repetitive effort so IT can focus on higher-value work.

## Thinking through familiar scenarios

Think about how these common events usually unfold:

- Wi-Fi stops working and the user restarts repeatedly before submitting a ticket
- A device “just feels slow,” requiring time-consuming remote support
- New hires aren’t sure which apps or settings to configure on day one

Now imagine a different experience. The operating system gathers diagnostics automatically, agents guide users through validated steps, remediation paths are suggested proactively, and IT receives clear summaries instead of raw logs. Recovery becomes faster, users feel more supported, and ticket volume decreases.

This is the direction Windows is moving—**a platform where people and agents work together, with IT still firmly in control.**

## Optional exercise: Identify opportunities for AI integration

Now that you understand why Windows is evolving for AI, let’s apply this concept to a real-world IT scenario.

Imagine you’re an IT admin at a mid-sized company. Your team spends hours each week resolving VPN and Wi-Fi issues.

**Task:**  
List three ways AI agents integrated into Windows could reduce repetitive support tickets in this scenario.

> Think about diagnostics, guided troubleshooting, and policy enforcement.

## Key takeaway from this unit

Windows is evolving to embed AI into the operating system, reducing friction and enabling smarter workflows. This shift sets the stage for bringing AI and agents into familiar Windows experiences.

Next, we’ll look at **how AI and agents show up in everyday Windows experiences** and what it means to bring assistance directly into familiar surfaces such as the taskbar, File Explorer, and system settings.
