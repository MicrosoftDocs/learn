Windows is being reinvented to support both people and intelligent agents. Instead of AI living only inside individual applications, Windows integrates AI and automation directly into the operating system experience. Assistance becomes something that shows up naturally where work is already happening—rather than something users have to stop and search for.

> [!NOTE]
> Some features in this unit require a **Microsoft 365 Copilot subscription**. Features specifically **marked as preview** may change before general availability. Availability can vary by tenant configuration, policy settings, build, and device type.

## Windows 11 for people and AI agents

Traditionally, using AI meant pausing work and switching context. This often interrupted focus and slowed progress.

| Traditional AI use | Integrated AI in Windows |
|--------------------|--------------------------|
| Open a browser | Access from the taskbar |
| Launch a chatbot | Use Copilot where work is happening |
| Copy and paste content | Work directly with content in File Explorer |
| Read results in another app | Receive assistance in the current workflow |
| Return to the original task | Stay within familiar Windows experiences |

For many users, constant context switching breaks flow and increases support requests when it isn’t clear **which tool is right for the job**.

Windows addresses this by bringing AI directly into familiar surfaces such as the taskbar, File Explorer, system search, notifications, Microsoft 365 applications, Microsoft Edge for Business, and system settings.

## Microsoft 365 Copilot as the common interface

Copilot provides a consistent way to interact with AI across apps and system experiences. Instead of switching between tools, users can access help directly where work is happening—whether drafting a document, adjusting settings, or troubleshooting an issue.

When AI becomes part of the places where people already work:

- Discovery is easier
- Training requirements decrease
- Adoption improves
- Assistance becomes contextual
- Interruptions are reduced

## Examples of AI in familiar Windows experiences

These experiences are designed to feel incremental, not disruptive.

- **Copilot available from the taskbar**  
  Users can access AI directly without opening a separate application-keeping their focus on the task at hand.

- **Microsoft 365 Copilot integration with File Explorer**  
  Users can summarize files, understand folder contents, or draft related emails based on selected documents—streamlining common file-related tasks

- **Voice interaction with Microsoft 365 Copilot**  
  Users can brainstorm ideas, draft responses, or prepare meeting content using voice-reducing app switching and manual typing.

Together, these capabilities make AI feel like a natural extension of Windows instead of “one more app to launch.”

> [!IMPORTANT]
> These AI experiences within Windows—such as Microsoft 365 Copilot File Explorer integration, and voice interactions—are **in preview** and may change.

## IT-relevant scenarios from everyday workflows

The benefits of familiar AI surfaces extend beyond convenience—they directly impact IT operations.

For example:

- **File review and communication drafting**  
  Copilot in File Explorer can help summarize selected files and generate draft communications, reducing time spent opening and scanning multiple documents.

- **Meeting preparation and ticket responses**  
  Voice interaction with Microsoft 365 Copilot allows IT staff to quickly capture ideas, summarize discussions, or prepare responses without breaking concentration.

- **Research and troubleshooting in Edge for Business**  
  AI capabilities in [Microsoft Edge for Business](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/deployedge/microsoft-edge-for-business) help synthesize information across multiple tabs while maintaining enterprise security, compliance, and control.

For end users, these same experiences reduce common support requests—such as “where do I find this?” or “how do I get started?”—before a ticket is ever created.

## Evolving the Windows platform for agents

These experiences are possible because Windows is evolving at the platform level—not just at the application layer.

Windows includes **native agent infrastructure** designed to help agents operate safely on devices. This includes secure agent connectors (preview) and a dedicated agent workspace (preview), all built to respect identity, consent, and organizational policy.

By embedding agent capabilities into core Windows services:

- Copilot and other agents can coordinate tasks across apps, files, and system functions
- Users receive context-aware assistance based on what they are doing
- IT teams retain control over what agents are allowed to do and when

Agents become first-class participants in the Windows experience, operating under the same governance and security expectations as other system components.

## Enabling custom AI solutions with Microsoft Foundry on Windows

All of the AI and agent experiences discussed in this module run on a native AI platform: **Microsoft Foundry on Windows**.

[Microsoft Foundry on Windows](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/ai/overview) provides a consistent set of tools that organizations can use to build, deploy, and operate AI solutions directly on Windows. These are the same tools used internally by Microsoft and made available to customers, enabling teams to move from experimentation to production using a shared platform.

Foundry supports the full AI development lifecycle—from model selection to deployment—and enables workloads to run across **CPUs, GPUs, and NPUs**. This flexibility allows organizations to choose the appropriate execution path based on performance, privacy, and operational requirements.

For IT teams, this means AI capabilities can be introduced into **line-of-business applications** using a standardized platform that aligns with Windows security, identity, and management controls. Rather than treating AI as a separate environment, Foundry integrates AI directly into Windows-based workflows in a way that is predictable, supportable, and scalable.

## How Microsoft Foundry on Windows supports IT and developers

Microsoft Foundry on Windows provides a consistent, Windows-native platform for developing and deploying AI solutions. By using the same underlying AI tooling across devices and applications, organizations can introduce AI capabilities without creating separate environments or fragmented deployment models.

From an IT perspective, this delivers several practical benefits:

- **Standardized development and deployment**  
  AI solutions follow a consistent lifecycle and deployment approach aligned with Windows.

- **Simplified support and operations**  
  AI workloads integrate into existing Windows applications and management processes instead of requiring parallel toolchains.

- **Policy-aligned execution**  
  AI capabilities inherit Windows security, identity, and management controls, making them easier to govern at scale.

- **Closer collaboration between IT and developers**  
  Developers can build AI-enabled line-of-business applications using platform-native tools, while IT retains visibility and control.

This approach reduces fragmentation and operational overhead by keeping AI workloads within the Windows platform, making them easier to deploy, manage, and support over time.

## Impact for IT professionals

As AI adoption expands, IT teams are increasingly asked to support solutions built with inconsistent tools, unclear deployment models, or limited governance. This often leads to fragmented environments, higher operational overhead, and increased risk.

Microsoft Foundry on Windows helps reduce this complexity by establishing a common AI platform aligned with Windows. As a result, IT teams can:

- **Support AI innovation at scale** without maintaining multiple parallel AI stacks
- **Apply security, identity, and compliance controls** consistently across AI workloads
- **Operationalize AI solutions** more efficiently as they move from experimentation into production

In practice, this enables organizations to extend beyond built-in AI features and deliver **custom, AI-powered business solutions**—while keeping Windows as the secure, managed foundation IT already supports.

## Optional exercise: Map AI to user workflows

Your organization wants to reduce context switching for employees.

**Task:**  
Match each Windows surface to an AI capability:

- Taskbar  
- File Explorer  
- System Search  

Capabilities:

- Summarize files  
- Invoke Copilot quickly  
- Search by natural language  

> [!NOTE]
> **Answers:** Taskbar → Invoke Copilot, File Explorer → Summarize files, System Search → Natural language search.

## Moving forward

You’ve seen how AI and Copilot show up in familiar Windows surfaces. Next, let’s dive deeper into the hardware that makes these experiences fast and reliable—Copilot+ PCs.
