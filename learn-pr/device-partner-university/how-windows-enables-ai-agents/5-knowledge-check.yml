          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct. Windows integrates AI to streamline tasks and improve productivity."
        - content: "To make AI a separate application"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. AI is moving away from being “one more app to open.”"
        - content: "To remove traditional workflows from Windows"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. AI enhances workflows, not eliminates them."
  - content: "What is a key benefit of running AI locally on Copilot+ PCs?"
    choices:
        - content: "Increased reliance on cloud connectivity"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. Local AI reduces dependence on cloud."
        - content: "Higher latency for AI responses"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. Local processing decreases latency."
        - content: "Improved privacy and reduced latency"
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct. Local AI keeps sensitive data on-device and speeds up responses."
        - content: "Elimination of all network-based tasks"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. Some tasks still require network access."
  - content: "Which Windows feature helps reduce repetitive IT tickets by guiding users through troubleshooting?"
    choices:
        - content: "Copilot+ PCs hardware"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. Hardware supports AI but does not guide troubleshooting directly."
        - content: "Microsoft Edge for Business"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. Edge helps with research, not troubleshooting tickets."
        - content: "Semantic Search"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. Search improves file discovery, not IT ticket reduction."
        - content: "Built-in AI agents"
