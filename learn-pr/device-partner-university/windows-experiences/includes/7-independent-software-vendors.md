We’re continuously partnering with new Independent Software Vendors (ISVs) to help them take advantage of our platform capabilities and the power of the Neural Processing Unit (NPU). These partnerships allow ISVs to benefit from ultra-low latency, higher performance, and enhanced security—with data processed right on the device.

***Moises Live by Music.AI***

Moises Live by Music.AI sets a new standard in real-time audio separation and control. Powered by the NPU, the app can isolate the volumes of percussion, vocals, and other elements—making music learning and practice more immersive and effective.

***Gigapixel AI by Topaz Labs***

Gigapixel AI by Topaz Labs revolutionizes the way people upscale images. With the power of the NPU, it can enlarge and enhance images up to 16 times their original size—while maintaining high quality and detail to help people design with greater accuracy.

***Other apps***

AI apps like CapCut, djay Pro, DaVinci Resolve, Camo, Cephable, and LiquidText also take advantage of the NPU to deliver faster, better working experiences. From video editing and music production to accessibility and note-taking, these apps showcase the NPU’s versatility in powering advanced, AI-driven functionalities.

## Microsoft Store on Windows

Windows Insiders can now enjoy new features in the Microsoft Store—including fresh experiences for Copilot+ PCs in the AI Hub.

The updated Home section offers personalized recommendations. Copilot is available right in the Store, letting you ask questions while browsing product pages to learn more about new apps. We’re also adding badges on product pages to clearly show which apps are designed exclusively for Copilot+ PCs and which applies AI.

Feature availability by market varies.
