## Three driving principles

At Microsoft, we base Windows feature design on three main principles:

### Tech should adapt to its users

Technology should adapt to people, not the other way around. With permission, we’re personalizing features based on user preferences to deliver a more consistent, richer experience.

### Tech should be useful and trustworthy

Experiences should be genuinely useful and trustworthy. Our features are purpose-driven, built around real needs, and rigorously assessed for safety and privacy before development starts.

### Tech should solve the hardest problems

We go beyond incremental improvements. We reimagine how Windows can empower people in new and groundbreaking ways on the devices they turn to when things matter most.

## Copilot+ PC experiences

The following features are now generally available across Copilot+ PCs—so you can find what you need, resume tasks seamlessly, and get more done with less time and effort.<sup>1</sup>

### Windows Search

Gone are the days of trying to memorize and remember file names or exact words. With improved Windows Search, you can describe what you're looking for, and Windows understands and finds it for you.

Improved Windows Search can understand the contextual meaning of words or phrases, making Search more natural and intuitive. Because Windows Search is now better at understanding context and intent, you can find what you need more quickly—resulting in less time spent searching and more time spent actually doing work.

### Recall (preview)

Recall transforms how you search for and rediscover content on your PC. It retrieves your digital memory, allowing you to quickly and securely find and get back to an app, website, image, or document.

You can simply scroll through your timeline or describe the content you remember. Better still, Recall is an opt-in experience with privacy controls to filter and customize what gets saved to find later.

### Click to Do (preview)

Why bounce between apps when workers can stay in the flow? Click to Do provides contextual shortcuts to relevant actions like summarizing, rewriting, or simply copying any text or images you see on screen.

You can stay focused and switch between tasks more easily by interacting with text and images in real time.
