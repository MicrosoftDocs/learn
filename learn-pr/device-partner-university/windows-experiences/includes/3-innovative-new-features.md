## Adding an agent to Settings

We set out to solve a common frustration—finding and changing settings on a PC—using the power of agents. With on-device AI, agents can understand user intent and, with permission, can automate and carry out tasks.

With this update to Settings, you can describe what you need help with—like *"how to control my PC by voice"* or *"my mouse pointer is too small"*—and the agent recommends steps to address it. With your permission and at your request, it can even complete the changes for you.

This experience is first available to Windows Insiders on Snapdragon-powered Copilot+ PCs and is coming soon to Windows Insiders on AMD- and Intel-powered devices. Only English language inputs are going to be supported initially.

## More actions in Click to Do

More actions are starting to roll out in Click to Do, including the option to create a bulleted list from selected text.

Windows Insiders can soon use [Ask Copilot](https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2025/04/03/announcing-windows-11-insider-preview-build-26120-3671-beta-channel/) to act on text or images, or even harness the power of Microsoft 365 Copilot to draft content in Microsoft Word. You’ll be able to use Click to Do to engage Reading Coach to practice reading selected text aloud, or use Immersive Reader to enhance their reading experience.

With Click to Do, you can quickly schedule meetings or send chats in Microsoft Teams from recognized emails—all without interrupting your workflow. You can also send table data from on screen directly into Microsoft Excel, saving time and reducing effort.

## New Windows Search actions

Windows Insiders can now find Windows settings and quickly find and install apps from the Microsoft Store.

We’re also bringing the same powerful search to the Photos app—making it faster and easier to find specific photos in your collection.
