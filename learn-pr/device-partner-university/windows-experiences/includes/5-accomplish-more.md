## Perfect screenshot

Perfect screenshot automatically adjusts the capture area to tightly frame on-screen content—reducing the need for post-capture cropping.

When activated, the tool uses a rectangular selection that analyzes the visible screen and snaps around the most prominent content in view. It provides crop handles for optional fine-tuning and is designed to make captures cleaner and more efficient with less effort.

## New features in Snipping tool

Snipping tool is also introducing two new capture tools:

- **Text extractor** allows people to extract and copy text directly from their images and screenshots.

- **Color picker** enables capturing exact color values from anywhere on screen.

These tools make it easier to work with text and design elements—giving you more flexibility when editing or sharing captured content.

This update also includes improvements to the underlying diffusion-based model to deliver better results, faster. The improved diffusion-based model is used in Cocreator and generative fill in Paint, as well as image creator and restyle image features in Photos.

These features are optimized for English text prompts and require an internet connection to access cloud services that help ensure the responsible use of AI.

## Rich image descriptions

Narrator now delivers rich image descriptions that enhance the accessibility and intuitiveness of Windows on Copilot+ PCs.

These descriptions provide detailed context for visuals—including charts, photos, and UI elements—helping blind and low-vision users better understand content without relying on alternative text.

Press *Narrator key + Ctrl + D* to hear a contextual description of an image, including people, objects, colors, text, and numbers.

With Narrator’s enhanced speech and screen reading features, understanding and interacting with visual content in Windows becomes easier.

Rich image descriptions are available now to Windows Insiders on Snapdragon X Series Copilot+ PCs, with support for AMD- and Intel-powered devices coming soon.

# Windows 11 experiences

Several new experiences started rolling out to Windows Insiders using Windows 11 this June.

## Start menu with phone companion

Start is more personal—with more options to customize and organize your apps. The new all apps category view automatically sorts based on the apps and categories you use most, so you can quickly access all your favorites.

And now with the phone companion in Start, your connected Android or iOS device is easily within reach.<sup>3</sup>

## AI actions in File Explorer

With AI actions in File Explorer, you can interact more deeply with your files. By right-clicking, you can quickly take actions like summarizing content or editing images.

Similar to Click to Do, AI actions in File Explorer help you stay in your flow. Using AI, you can take advantage of editing tools in apps like Paint and Photos, and Copilot features across Microsoft 365—all without opening your files.

## Notepad

Create, organize, and format content more easily with new capabilities in Notepad.<sup>4</sup>

The new write function generates text from your prompt, helping you quickly develop ideas or start a draft. The summarize function condenses longer content into a concise overview, making it easier to review.

Notepad also supports formatting like bold, italics, simple lists, and headings. It’s compatible with Markdown-style input and files, perfect if you prefer working in that markup language.

## Copilot on Windows

The Copilot on Windows app is adding new ways to use AI directly from the taskbar. Copilot Vision on Windows lets you share any browser or app window with Copilot, enabling it to analyze content, offer insights, answer questions, and provide coaching aloud.

Windows Insiders can also try Press to Talk by long-pressing the Copilot key to engage voice. Soon, you’ll be able to launch Copilot hands-free with the phrase *"Hey, Copilot!"*—an opt-in voice activation feature currently in testing.

Copilot Vision on Windows is available now to Windows Insiders and will be generally available soon, starting with users in the U.S.
