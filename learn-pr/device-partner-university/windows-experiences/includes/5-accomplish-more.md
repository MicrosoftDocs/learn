## Perfect screenshot

Perfect screenshot automatically adjusts the capture area to tightly frame on-screen content—reducing the need for post-capture cropping.

When activated, the tool uses a rectangular selection that analyzes the visible screen and snaps around the most prominent content in view. It provides crop handles for optional fine-tuning and is designed to make captures cleaner and more efficient with less effort.

## New features in Snipping tool

Snipping tool is also introducing two new capture tools:

- **Text extractor** allows people to extract and copy text directly from their images and screenshots.

- **Color picker** enables capturing exact color values from anywhere on screen.

These tools make it easier to work with text and design elements—giving you more flexibility when editing or sharing captured content.

This update also includes improvements to the underlying diffusion-based model to deliver better results, faster. The improved diffusion-based model is used in Cocreator and generative fill in Paint, as well as image creator and restyle image features in Photos.

These features are optimized for English text prompts and require an internet connection to access cloud services that help ensure the responsible use of AI.
