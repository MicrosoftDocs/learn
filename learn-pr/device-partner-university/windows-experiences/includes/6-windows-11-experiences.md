Several new experiences started rolling out to Windows Insiders using Windows 11 this June.

## Start menu with phone companion

Start is more personal—with more options to customize and organize your apps. The new all apps category view automatically sorts based on the apps and categories you use most, so you can quickly access all your favorites.

And now with the phone companion in Start, your connected Android or iOS device is easily within reach.<sup>3</sup>

## AI actions in File Explorer

With AI actions in File Explorer, you can interact more deeply with your files. By right-clicking, you can quickly take actions like summarizing content or editing images.

Similar to Click to Do, AI actions in File Explorer help you stay in your flow. Using AI, you can take advantage of editing tools in apps like Paint and Photos, and Copilot features across Microsoft 365—all without opening your files.

## Notepad

Create, organize, and format content more easily with new capabilities in Notepad.<sup>4</sup>

The new write function generates text from your prompt, helping you quickly develop ideas or start a draft. The summarize function condenses longer content into a concise overview, making it easier to review.

Notepad also supports formatting like bold, italics, simple lists, and headings. It’s compatible with Markdown-style input and files, perfect if you prefer working in that markup language.

## Copilot on Windows

The Copilot on Windows app is adding new ways to use AI directly from the taskbar. Copilot Vision on Windows lets you share any browser or app window with Copilot, enabling it to analyze content, offer insights, answer questions, and provide coaching aloud.

Windows Insiders can also try Press to Talk by long-pressing the Copilot key to engage voice. Soon, you’ll be able to launch Copilot hands-free with the phrase *"Hey, Copilot!"*—an opt-in voice activation feature currently in testing.

Copilot Vision on Windows is available now to Windows Insiders and will be generally available soon, starting with users in the U.S.
