Windows IoT is an operating system designed for Internet of Things (IoT) devices. It supports a wide range of hardware types, including automated teller machines (ATMs), kiosks, smart lighting systems, and other embedded solutions.

## Device management tools

Windows IoT is compatible with several device management platforms:

**Windows Admin Center:** A web-based interface for configuring and monitoring Windows devices, including IoT endpoints.

**Microsoft Endpoint Manager:** Provides centralized management capabilities such as policy enforcement, software updates, and security configuration.

**Azure IoT Hub:** A cloud-based service for connecting, monitoring, and managing IoT devices. It supports remote provisioning, firmware updates, and device health monitoring.

These tools enable IT administrators to deploy, configure, monitor, and update Windows IoT devices efficiently and at scale.

## Security features

Securing IoT devices presents distinct challenges due to their operational characteristics and deployment environments:

- **High degree of automation:** IoT devices typically operate without direct human interaction, requiring security solutions tailored to their limited flexibility and oversight.
- **Outdated systems:** Legacy platforms and infrastructure may lack current security protections, increasing vulnerability to modern threats. Security systems must support ongoing maintenance and updates.
- **Device limitations:** Many IoT devices have constrained processing power, memory, and connectivity. Security protocols must be lightweight and optimized for these constraints.
- **Device importance:** Mission-critical devices such as medical equipment, industrial control systems, and connected vehicles require robust protection due to the potential impact of security breaches.
- **Physical vulnerability:** Devices may be exposed to local or physical attacks. Security strategies should include physical safeguards and support for secure local network management.

Windows IoT includes integrated security features:

**BitLocker:** Encrypts device data to prevent unauthorized access.

**Secure Boot:** Ensures only trusted software executes during startup.

**Device Guard:** Restricts execution to approved applications, reducing exposure to malicious software.

**Windows Defender:** Provides built-in antivirus and antimalware protection.

**Lockdown Modes:** Limits user access to system settings and functions to prevent misconfiguration.

These features collectively help protect data, maintain device integrity, and support compliance with industry standards.

## Cloud integration

Windows IoT supports integration with cloud platforms to enable centralized management, analytics, and scalability across distributed deployments.

### How cloud integration works

- Devices connect to cloud services such as Microsoft Azure.
- Data from devices (e.g., sensor readings, usage metrics, alerts) is transmitted to the cloud for storage, analysis, and processing.
- Administrators can remotely monitor device status, deploy updates, and manage configurations using cloud-based tools.

### Benefits of cloud integration

Cloud connectivity enables:

**Analytics:** Aggregates data from multiple devices to identify patterns, optimize operations, and predict maintenance needs.

**AI and machine learning:** Supports cloud-based models for anomaly detection, automation, and personalized experiences.

**Remote updates:** Facilitates software and firmware updates without requiring physical access to devices.

**Scalability:** Simplifies the addition and management of devices as deployments expand.

## Application support

Windows IoT supports both custom-developed and standard Windows applications.

**Custom applications:**

Developers can build applications tailored to specific device functions, such as sensor monitoring, machinery control, or user interaction. Supported development frameworks include .NET, UWP, and Win32.

**Standard Windows applications:**

Many existing Windows applications are compatible with Windows IoT Enterprise, enabling reuse of software for tasks such as data processing, reporting, and device management.

**Integration with hardware:**

Applications can interface with device hardware (e.g., sensors, actuators, displays) using standard Windows APIs or custom drivers, enabling real-time control and data acquisition.
