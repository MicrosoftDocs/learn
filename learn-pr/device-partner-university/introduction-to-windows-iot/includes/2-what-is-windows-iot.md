Windows IoT is a specialized version of the Windows operating system designed for Internet of Things (IoT) devices. It is deployed in environments such as gas stations, ATMs, industrial sensors, and smart devices, enabling these systems to collect, process, and transmit data autonomously.

## What Windows IoT offers

Windows IoT builds on nearly three decades of experience in developing operating systems for embedded and specialized devices. As the successor to Windows CE and Windows Embedded, it enables organizations to deploy, manage, and secure a wide range of dedicated devices using established tools and a stable, long-term supported platform.

- **Reliability and longevity**: Offers long-term support (up to ten years), ensuring consistent operation and security throughout the device lifecycle. This is essential for deployments requiring sustained performance over extended periods.
- **Security**: Includes comprehensive security features such as encryption, secure boot, code integrity, exploit mitigation, and hardware-level protections. These capabilities address the specific security requirements of IoT environments.
- **Compatibility and manageability**: Supports x64 and ARM64 architectures and is compatible with a broad range of existing devices and applications. Organizations can utilize familiar development and management tools to streamline deployment and maintenance.
- **Efficiency and productivity**: Designed to support both simple and complex IoT scenarios. Built-in features and drivers facilitate rapid development and reduce operational overhead.
- **Cloud and AI integration**: Enables centralized management, analytics, and AI functionality through integration with cloud platforms such as Azure. This supports data-driven decision-making and intelligent edge solutions.
- **Low total cost of ownership**: Licensing includes support, updates, and enhancements, helping organizations manage operational costs and maintain a complete solution.
- **Versatility**: Applicable across diverse use cases, including industrial automation, smart devices, and edge-based AI analytics.
