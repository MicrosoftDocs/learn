The internet is all around us. From smart home devices to industrial sensors, many products continuously transmit and receive data. This network of connected devices is referred to as the Internet of Things (IoT).

This module introduces Windows IoT, a specialized version of the Windows operating system designed for IoT devices. It supports a range of deployment scenarios, including single-purpose devices and complex integrated systems. Core capabilities include enterprise-grade security, remote device management, cloud service integration, hardware compatibility, and support for running Windows applications on dedicated devices.

Windows IoT provides features such as long-term support, secure device operation, centralized management tools, integration with cloud and AI services, and flexibility to run custom or standard Windows applications across various hardware platforms.

## Learning objectives

- Evaluate whether Windows IoT meets the requirements for device management, security, and integration in various scenarios.
- Describe how the main components of Windows IoT function and interact, including the operating system, management tools, security features, cloud integration, and application support.
