Sales teams depend on up-to-date performance data to make informed decisions. But spreadsheets full of figures can be hard to interpret quickly.

Imagine you're a sales professional preparing for your weekly pipeline review. You've exported last quarter's results from your CRM into Excel. The data is extensive—hundreds of rows across multiple regions and product lines—and you need a quick summary that highlights trends and outliers before your meeting. Instead of manually sorting and calculating, you can use Copilot in Excel to do the heavy lifting.

By the end of this module, you'll be able to use Copilot in Excel to summarize and visualize sales data, helping you communicate insights faster and more confidently.
