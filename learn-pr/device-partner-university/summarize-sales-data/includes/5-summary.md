Sales professionals often need to review performance data quickly to prepare for meetings or identify trends. In this module, you explored how Copilot in Excel can help you summarize and visualize large datasets so you can focus on insights instead of formulas.

You learned that Copilot understands structured tables and natural-language prompts. By asking questions such as *"Summarize total revenue by region"* or *"Show top-performing products,"* you can generate summaries, tables, and charts in seconds. In the exercise, you practiced refining your results and creating visuals that make your findings easier to communicate.

Without Copilot, these steps would require building pivot tables, writing formulas, and formatting charts manuallyâ€”tasks that can take significant time and expertise.

Using Copilot, you can turn raw sales data into clear, actionable information with just a few prompts. This efficiency helps you prepare faster, identify trends sooner, and contribute more strategic insights during team discussions.
