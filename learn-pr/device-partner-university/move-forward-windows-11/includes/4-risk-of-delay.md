Modern work deserves modern protection‚Äîand waiting to upgrade could introduce unnecessary risks.

While your Windows 10 devices may still function, they **will no longer receive essential security updates, technical support, or compatibility enhancements** available with modern Windows 11 Pro devices. 

This creates growing exposure to threats like viruses, malware, and operational disruptions.

## Outdated PCs, higher risks

Outdated Windows 10 devices are:

- ‚ùå Less secure  
- üîß More expensive to maintain  
- üß® Vulnerable to modern cyber threats 

After Windows 10 end of support, these devices won‚Äôt receive essential updates, leaving your organization exposed.

## Windows 11 built-in security

Windows 11 Pro PCs shield businesses against evolving threats with the latest security updates and powerful hardware-backed protection enabled by default.

Built-in defenses, including TPM 2.0, enhanced authentication, and virtualization-based security, safeguard data and defend against phishing, malware, and credential theft.

## Security risks with EOS

**Security vulnerabilities**  
Without regular updates, Windows 10 devices are vulnerable to cyberattacks, data breaches, and malware‚Äîcreating risk where there could be resilience.

**Decreased productivity**  
Old devices are slower and require more maintenance, dragging down productivity. That means more downtime, more IT intervention, and higher costs for troubleshooting.

**Compatibility issues**  
Older devices may struggle with new apps and tools, resulting in compatibility issues. This can slow innovation and limit the ability to adopt modern solutions.

As you‚Äôll see in the next section, Windows 11 Pro doesn‚Äôt just respond to security risks‚Äîit helps you stay ahead of them.
