Modern work deserves modern protection‚Äîand now that Windows 10 has reached End of Support, waiting to upgrade introduces unnecessary risk.

While Windows 10 devices may still function, they **no longer receive essential security updates, technical support, or compatibility enhancements** available on modern Windows 11 Pro devices.  
This ongoing gap creates growing exposure to threats like malware, phishing, and operational disruptions.

## Outdated PCs, higher risks

Continuing to use unsupported Windows 10 devices increases organizational risk:

- ‚ùå Less secure and harder to defend  
- üîß More expensive to maintain  
- üß® Vulnerable to modern cyber threats  

| **Risk area** | **Impact on Windows 10 devices** | **Benefit with Windows 11 Pro** |
|----------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Security | No new patches for vulnerabilities | Regular updates and built-in protections |
| Productivity | Slower performance and downtime | Faster, more reliable experiences |
| IT costs | More manual maintenance | Streamlined management and automation |

Because these devices no longer receive security updates, they quickly fall behind evolving attack methods‚Äîleaving your business exposed to compliance, performance, and productivity challenges.

## Windows 11 built-in security

Windows 11 Pro devices shield organizations against evolving threats with the latest security updates and hardware-backed protection enabled by default.  

Built-in defenses‚Äîincluding TPM 2.0, Windows Hello, virtualization-based security (VBS), and Smart App Control‚Äîhelp safeguard sensitive data and defend against phishing, malware, and credential theft.

## Security risks post-EOS

**Security vulnerabilities**  
Without regular updates, Windows 10 devices are increasingly susceptible to cyberattacks, data breaches, and malware‚Äîcreating risk where there could be resilience.

**Decreased productivity**  
Unsupported devices often perform slower and require more maintenance, resulting in more downtime, higher IT workloads, and increased troubleshooting costs.

**Compatibility issues**  
Older hardware and software can struggle to support new business apps and tools, limiting innovation and slowing adoption of modern AI and collaboration solutions.

As you‚Äôll see in the next section, Windows 11 Pro doesn‚Äôt just respond to these security challenges‚Äîit helps you stay ahead of them with proactive protection built for the AI era.
