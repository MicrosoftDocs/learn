Windows 10 **reached end of support (EOS) on October 14, 2025**. Now that support has ended, Windows 10 devices no longer receive security updates, bug fixes, or technical assistance. This makes it more important than ever to transition to Windows 11 Pro—helping your organization stay secure, productive, and ready for what’s next.  

Upgrading to Windows 11 Pro unlocks powerful AI tools, modern security, and simplified device management—**so your organization stays ready for whatever comes next.**

Let’s take a closer look at what’s at stake—and what you gain by moving forward.


## Why upgrade now

With Windows 10 support ended, continuing to use legacy devices increases exposure to security risks and system instability.  

By moving to Windows 11 Pro, organizations can reduce risk and modernize their environment.

| **Windows 10 (Post-EOS)** | **Windows 11 Pro (Next Step)** |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------|
| 🔒 No more security updates | ✅ Continuous chip-to-cloud protection |
| 🐞 No new bug fixes or patches | ✅ Regular reliability and performance updates |
| 📞 No technical support | ✅ Dedicated support and management resources |
| ⚠️ Increased vulnerability & compliance risk | ✅ Zero Trust security and hardware-based protection |
| 💸 Rising maintenance costs | ✅ Simplified management and lower total cost of ownership |

Without these updates, devices become more vulnerable to security threats, system issues, and increasing support costs.  

## Key advantages of upgrading

By upgrading to Windows 11 Pro, your organization gains access to:  
- **Microsoft Copilot** for AI-powered productivity  
- **Built-in, chip-to-cloud zero-trust security**  
- **Streamlined IT management tools** for modern deployment and control
