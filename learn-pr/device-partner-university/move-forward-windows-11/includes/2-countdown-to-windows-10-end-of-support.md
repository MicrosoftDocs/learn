Windows 10 will reach End of Support (EOS) on **October 14, 2025**. That deadline may seem far off, but the time to act is now. Delaying the upgrade could mean missing out on critical security, productivity, and innovation advancements.  

Upgrading to Windows 11 Pro unlocks powerful AI tools, modern security, and simplified device management—**so your organization stays ready for whatever comes next**.

Let’s take a closer look at what’s at stake—and what you gain by preparing early.

## Why upgrade now

After EOS, Windows 10 devices will no longer receive:  
- 🔒 Security updates  
- 🐞 Bug fixes  
- 📞 Technical support  

Without these updates, devices become more vulnerable to security threats, system issues, and increasing support costs.  

By upgrading today, your organization gains access to:  
- **Microsoft Copilot** for AI-powered productivity  
- **Built-in zero-trust security features**  
- **Streamlined IT tools** for smarter device management
