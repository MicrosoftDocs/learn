Windows 10 and Windows 11 are designed to work together, allowing businesses to manage both with the same tools and processes.

They can save time with secure, automated setups, using existing tools for both pilot programs and full rollouts—ensuring quick employee onboarding with seamless remote configuration and automated updates.

## Bridge the gap with Extended Security Updates

Not every organization can migrate overnight. Microsoft provides a short-term solution to help maintain protection while you complete your Windows 11 Pro rollout.

### Temporary protection with Extended Security Updates (ESU)

- **Extended Security Updates program**  
  As businesses transition to Windows 11 Pro or Copilot+ PCs, Microsoft’s [Extended Security Updates program](/windows/whats-new/extended-security-updates) offers a temporary solution for Windows 10 devices that need more time to upgrade. **Although not a permanent fix**, the ESU program ensures continued protection with critical security updates—safeguarding PCs while new features and support are phased out.

- **Cost considerations for ESUs**  
  ESU enrollment provides security updates for up to three years. **Costs increase annually, and organizations enrolling in Year Two must pay for both Year One and Year Two, as fees are cumulative**.

### ESU cost and coverage overview

| **ESU year** | **Coverage duration** | **Included updates** | **Cost model** | **Key notes** |
|---------------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------|----------------|
| **Year 1** | Begins immediately after Windows 10 End of Support | Critical and important updates | Base cost | Available upon enrollment |
| **Year 2** | Extends coverage for one additional year | Critical and important updates | +100% of Year 1 (cumulative) | Requires payment for Year 1 and Year 2 |
| **Year 3** | Final year of ESU availability | Critical and important updates | +100% of Year 2 (cumulative) | No ESU coverage beyond this point |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **ESUs are designed as a temporary bridge—not a long-term solution.**  
> Transition to Windows 11 Pro as early as possible to reduce security exposure, maintain compliance, and avoid escalating ESU costs.
