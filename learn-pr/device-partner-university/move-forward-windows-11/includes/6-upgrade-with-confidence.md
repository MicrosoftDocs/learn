## Bridge the gap with Extended Security Updates

### Temporary protection with Extended Security Updates (ESU)

- **Extended Security Updates program**  
  As businesses transition to Windows 11 Pro or Copilot+ PCs, Microsoft’s [Extended Security Updates program](/windows/whats-new/extended-security-updates) offers a temporary solution for Windows 10 devices that need more time to upgrade. **Although not a permanent fix**, the ESU program ensures continued protection with critical security updates—safeguarding PCs while new features and support are phased out.

- **Cost considerations for ESUs**  
  ESU enrollment provides security updates for up to three years. **Costs increase annually, and organizations enrolling in Year Two must pay for both Year One and Year Two, as fees are cumulative**.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Move to Windows 11 as early as possible to reduce long-term security risks and avoid rising ESU expenses.
