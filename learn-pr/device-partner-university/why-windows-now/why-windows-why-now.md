With Windows EOS fast approaching, it's improtant for them to recognize the urgent need to upgrade before support needs. This messaging highlights the security risks of not moving to Windows 11 and the productivity and performance benefits they'll gain by acting now.

- _Windows 11 Pro PC_: These users have largely already moved to Windows 11, but they might still have some Windows 10 or older Windows 11 devices that need to be refreshed. Fortunately, they're usually motivated and tend to act on necessary updates. With Windows 11 Pro's core messaging, these users will be encouraged to update their devices, which references all available devices (inlcuding Copilot+ PCs).
