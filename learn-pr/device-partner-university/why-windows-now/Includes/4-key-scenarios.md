## The right messaging

Different users have different reasons for upgrading to Windows 11 Pro, depending on:

- Progress on their upgrade journey
- Device eligibility
- Current AI roadmap

These factors help to determine the right messaging. Understanding how Windows 11 can meet their needs can help drive an upgrade decision—whether it’s improving security, increasing productivity, or unlocking AI potential—helping them achieve their business goals.

## Key user scenarios

Now let's explore the three key user scenarios for a Windows 11 device upgrade:

- _Windows 10 End of Support (EOS)_: These users have a high volume of outdated Windows 10 devices. With Windows end of support fast approaching, it's important for them to recognize the urgent need to upgrade before support needs. This messaging highlights the security risks of not moving to Windows 11 and the productivity and performance benefits they gain by acting now.

- _Windows 11 Pro PC_: These users are actively moving to Windows 11, but they might still have some Windows 10 or older Windows 11 devices that need to be refreshed. Fortunately, they're motivated and tend to act on necessary updates. With Windows 11 Pro's core messaging, these users are encouraged to update their devices, which references all available devices (including Copilot+ PCs).

- _Copilot+ PCs_: These users are advanced Windows 11 users and have a strong interest in or already use AI. They're a great fit for Copilot+ PCs, especially of they have a solid AI roadmap or develop in-house  (Independent Software Vendors) apps. Copilot+ PC messaging alone or combined with Windows 11 core messaging helps to drive adoption for these users. This approach is also beneficial for users thinking of switching over to Windows 11 from other platforms.
