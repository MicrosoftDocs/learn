You can use Microsoft-built agents or create your own standalone agents with Copilot Studio. There are different types of agents available, so you can choose what works best for your specific needs.

## Prompt-and-response agents

These agents perform specific tasks based on a user's input or "prompt." They process the given input and generate a corresponding response, facilitating a back-and-forth exchange with the user.

They're helpful for streamlining routine interactions and enhancing customer support&mdash;without adding more complexity to existing systems. They can be used as chatbots, virtual assistants, or specialized AI systems for business apps.

## Cognitive agents

Designed to mimic human thought processes, these agents use machine learning and natural language processing to understand, learn, and adapt to user behavior over time. This ability enables them to analyze historical data and take action based on what they learn.

Cognitive agents can analyze customer data to deliver tailored recommendations that support informed decision-making. By using data-driven insights, these agents help create more personalized user experiences, improving customer satisfaction and engagement.

## Autonomous agents

These agents have their own distinct roles and capabilities. While they operate independently as an entity, they're also able to interact and collaborate with other agents to solve complex problems, optimize larger processes, or achieve a specific goal. 

These multi-agent systems are often used in logistics and supply chain management, where agents can orchestrate tasks like inventory management, shipment tracking, and resource allocation. You can also use these agents to enhance efficiency across departments.
