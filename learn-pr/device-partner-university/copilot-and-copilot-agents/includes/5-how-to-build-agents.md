# How can I build agents?

To build agents, start by logging into [Copilot Studio](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-copilot/microsoft-copilot-studio?msockid=1c78a392f9cd65fc11bdb6fdf847642e). It offers a low-code way to create agents&mdash;starting with grounding them in their own data.

From there, you can add actions that conect to your business systems, so the agent can perform tasks. For more sensitive or complex topics, you can design custom flows to stay in control. Then it's time to test, refine, and customize until your agent is exactly how you want it. 

## Building in Copilot Studio

With Copilot Studio, you can build agents and publish them anywhere--including Microsoft 365 Copilot. 

When you publish to Copilot, your organization benefits from being able to use that agent within the apps employees frequently work in&mdash;like Microsoft Teams, SharePoint, and [Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat](https://support.microsoft.com/topic/get-started-with-microsoft-365-copilot-chat-5b00a52d-7296-48ee-b938-b95b7209f737).

By bringing agents into these familiar apps, employees can work faster, make smarter decisions, and focus their attention on more meaningful tasks.
