If your customer has a qualifying Microsoft 365 plan, they can add Copilot to their subscription from their Microsoft admin center account.

If they're not an existing customer, they must first buy an eligible subscription. Check out the [plans and pricing](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/business/microsoft-365-plans-and-pricing) page for more details.
