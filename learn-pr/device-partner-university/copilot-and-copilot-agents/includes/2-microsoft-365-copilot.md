Microsoft 365 Copilot is a powerful AI assistant that helps boost productivity and simplify everyday tasks.

It’s built right into the Microsoft 365 apps your customers already use&mdash;like Outlook, Word, and Excel&mdash;offering real-time support and smart suggestions as they work.

Whether they’re writing emails, creating documents, or staying on top of their calendar&mdash;Copilot helps them get more done with less effort.

## Reinventing productivity

One of the key benefits of Copilot is its ability to understand and respond to natural language queries.

An employee can ask Copilot to perform tasks, find information, or provide recommendations just by typing or speaking their request. For example, they can ask Copilot to summarize a lengthy document, find relevant emails, or even draft a response for them.

This intuitive interaction allows them to focus on what matters most, while Copilot takes care of repetitive and time-consuming tasks.

## Benefits of Copilot

Additionally, Copilot leverages the power of AI to provide personalized assistance tailored to your customers' needs.

It learns from employee interactions and adapts to their preferences, ensuring that the support they receive is always relevant and helpful.

With Copilot, employees can collaborate more effectively with their team, stay organized, and make informed decisions with ease. 

Microsoft 365 Copilot transforms work in three meaningful ways:

- **Unleash creativity.** Copilot helps employees create content faster and more efficiently.  
- **Unlock productivity.** Copilot helps employees focus on what matters most.  
- **Improve skills.** Copilot makes employees better at what they’re good at and helps them quickly master what they have yet to learn.
