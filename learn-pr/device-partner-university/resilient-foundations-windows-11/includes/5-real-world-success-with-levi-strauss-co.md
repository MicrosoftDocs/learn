Levi Strauss & Co. is one of the world's most recognized apparel brands. With its scale, it faced challenges with hybrid work, IT complexity, and security compliance across a global workforce of 15,000+ employees. They needed a modern, secure platform to simplify IT management and accelerate product innovation. After deploying Windows 11 Pro and Copilot+ PCs, Chris Clark, Vice President, and Chief Information Officer at Levi's, noted, "Windows 11 and Copilot+ PCs are transforming how our teams design, make, and deliver—bringing the innovation and agility of the Levi's brand to every part of our business."

Before deploying new solutions, Levi's faced the following issues:

- Legacy systems slow down deployment and complicated device management.
- Global teams need consistent, secure experience in retail and corporate environments.
- IT sought to reduce complexity while enabling creativity and collaboration.

To solve these issues, Levi's adopted Windows 11 Pro and Copilot+ PCs for their business, creating a secure, resilient foundation for global operations. Their approach included:

- **Modern OS fundamentals:** Windows 11 Pro provides a consistent, polished user experience with features like Snap layouts, improved Settings navigation, and optimized performance for hybrid work scenarios. This ensured that both retail and corporate environments had reliable tools to stay productive.
- **Security integration at every layer:** Secured-core PCs and Microsoft Pluton processors delivered hardware-level protection against evolving threats. While Windows Hello Enhanced Sign-in Security (ESS) enables passwordless authentication, reducing identity risks and speeding secure access. These safeguards ensure compliance and protect sensitive design and retail data.
- **Automation for IT efficiency:** Levi's deployed Windows Autopatch to streamline monthly security updates across Levi's global fleet. The company also utilized Hotpatch to apply updates without requiring reboots—reducing disruption and maintaining uptime.
- **AI-driven productivity:** Copilot+ PCs and Microsoft 365 Copilot introduced intelligent workflows, enabling employees to collaborate faster, make smarter decisions, and innovate across design and operations.

By adopting Windows 11 Pro and Copilot+ PCs, Levi's was able to make a bigger impact on their day-to-day productivity while freeing up time to innovate in their field. This decision provided the following benefits:

- Unified global workforce on a secure, modern platform.
- Device setup time dropped, freeing IT for strategic initiatives.
- Improved collaboration and operational efficiency with AI-powered tools.
- Stronger security posture and faster recovery during incidents.
