Collaboration in PowerPoint isn’t just about building slides together—it’s also about refining ideas and making sure every perspective is heard. Even the strongest presentations benefit from multiple rounds of feedback, and PowerPoint’s commenting tools provide a structured way to capture those insights.  

When teams try to manage feedback through email chains or chat threads, ideas can be missed, conflicting edits pile up, and valuable input is lost in the shuffle. Comments in PowerPoint solve this by keeping all feedback in one place, tied directly to the slides where it’s most relevant.  

By using comments, your team can focus less on chasing down suggestions and more on improving the quality of the presentation. Whether it’s flagging a chart that needs an update, suggesting clearer wording, or asking a question about a detail, feedback becomes visible, actionable, and easier to track from start to finish.  

## Use comments to focus feedback

Comments attach feedback directly to slides, text, or visuals so suggestions are clear and easy to act on. Instead of vague email threads, feedback stays tied to the exact element under discussion. With **@mentions**, you can assign action items to specific teammates, while the ability to resolve or reopen comments keeps a clear record of progress.  

Benefits of using comments include:  

- **Clarify suggestions:** Keep feedback visible where it’s needed.  
- **Assign action items:** Tag teammates with **@mentions** to ensure accountability.  
- **Track decisions:** Resolve or reopen comments as issues are addressed.  

## Apply comments during teamwork

Imagine you’re preparing a sales deck with your team. One person notices a chart that needs updating, another suggests rewording a headline, and a third has a question about product details. By inserting comments directly in PowerPoint:  

- Each suggestion is attached to the correct slide or element.  
- Teammates can reply to comments, discuss options, and reach consensus.  
- Once an issue is fixed, the comment is marked as resolved—keeping the presentation tidy.  

## Key features of comments in PowerPoint

- **Insert comments:** Add feedback to any slide, shape, or text box.  
- **@mentions:** Tag specific collaborators to notify them and assign tasks.  
- **Resolve and reopen:** Mark comments as complete or bring them back for more discussion.  
- **Threaded discussions:** Keep replies grouped with the original comment for context.  

> [!TIP]  
> Keep comments focused and actionable. Be specific about what needs to change and why, so your team can respond quickly.  

## Strengthen teamwork with structured feedback

By using PowerPoint’s commenting tools, teams can:  

- Reduce miscommunication and prevent lost feedback.  
- Speed up the review process by centralizing all discussions.  
- Ensure every suggestion is tracked and resolved.  

Structured, in-context feedback leads to clearer communication, smoother collaboration, and more polished presentations.
