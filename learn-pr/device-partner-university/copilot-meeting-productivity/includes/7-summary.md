Your organization relies on Microsoft Teams to collaborate across departments, time zones, and work styles. But with the growing volume of meetings, professionals are struggling to stay informed, contribute meaningfully, and make decisions efficiently. In the past, catching up on missed meetings meant watching recordings, scanning transcripts, or relying on second hand notes—often leading to missed insights and uneven participation.

In this module, you learned how Copilot in Microsoft Teams helps transform meetings into searchable, interactive experiences. Whether you're attending live or catching up later, Copilot enables you to summarize discussions, query past meetings, and identify contributions—all within a secure, AI-powered workspace. By reducing the burden of manual reviews and promoting inclusive collaboration, Copilot empowers teams to stay aligned, reclaim time, and focus on strategic work.
