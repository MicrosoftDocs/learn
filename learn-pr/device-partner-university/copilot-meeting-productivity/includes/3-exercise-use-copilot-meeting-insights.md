In this exercise, you experience how Copilot in Microsoft Teams enhances meetings as they happen. By asking Copilot questions during a live session, you see how it can clarify discussions, highlight key takeaways, and keep participants aligned in real time.

Imagine you’re leading a virtual meeting with your project team to finalize details for an upcoming product launch. The discussion moves quickly—marketing, design, and engineering all have updates to share.

As the meeting progresses, you want to ensure everyone leaves with clear next steps and that no critical feedback gets lost. Copilot can help by listening in, summarizing the conversation, and suggesting questions or actions while the meeting is still underway.
