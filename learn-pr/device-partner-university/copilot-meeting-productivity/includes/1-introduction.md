Modern work depends on collaboration—and meetings are at the center of it. Yet as organizations become more connected, the number of meetings continues to rise. Professionals are spending more time in discussions but not always gaining more value from them. Many teams struggle with meeting fatigue, unclear outcomes, and uneven participation. How can teams stay informed without attending every session? How can leaders ensure all voices are heard?

Imagine you’re an IT professional or team lead responsible for improving collaboration across your organization. Your teams rely on Microsoft Teams for daily communication, but the constant stream of meetings makes it difficult to keep up. You need a way to reduce the burden of live attendance, extract meaningful insights, and foster inclusive engagement.

Copilot in Microsoft Teams helps solve these challenges. It uses generative AI to turn meetings into searchable, interactive records. With Copilot, users can summarize discussions, query past meetings, and identify who contributed—or who didn’t get a chance to. This module shows how Copilot can help you reclaim time, improve meeting outcomes, and support equitable collaboration.
