Not every team member can attend every meeting—but that doesn’t mean they should fall behind. Copilot in Microsoft Teams helps users stay informed and engaged by turning past meetings into dynamic, easy-to-digest insights. Whether you’re catching up after being out or reviewing outcomes across multiple sessions, Copilot ensures you can focus on what matters most.

For example, a project manager preparing for a quarterly planning session can open Copilot to review past meeting summaries. Within minutes, they can see what decisions were made, which items carried over, and where progress stalled—without sorting through hours of recordings. That context allows them to start the next meeting ready to act instead of spending time revisiting old discussions.

## Copilot features that enhance meeting efficiency

The following table outlines key Copilot features and how they support meeting productivity. Availability may vary based on your Microsoft 365 Copilot license and whether transcription is enabled.

| **Feature Area**            | **What It Does**                                                                                              | **How It Helps**                                                                                  |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Post-meeting summaries**  | Automatically generates concise recaps highlighting key decisions, action items, and topics discussed.        | Enables users to catch up quickly without rewatching recordings or reading full transcripts.      |
| **Real-time insights**      | Provides contextual prompts and summaries during meetings—such as clarifying points or listing pros and cons. | Keeps participants focused, improves understanding, and captures next steps without manual notes. |
| **Inclusive collaboration** | Identifies missed or interrupted contributions and highlights all participants’ input.                        | Promotes equitable engagement and ensures every voice is represented in meeting summaries.        |

These features work together to create continuity across meetings. When teams review Copilot summaries from earlier sessions, they can quickly identify patterns—topics that keep resurfacing, recurring blockers, or ownership gaps. Over time, this helps leaders refine processes, improve meeting agendas, and track long-term project health. Copilot becomes not only a recap tool but also a lens for continuous improvement.

## Get the most out of meetings

By understanding how Copilot captures and presents meeting insights, professionals can make better use of their time—focusing on analysis and next steps rather than catching up on what they missed. Whether attending live or reviewing afterward, Copilot ensures collaboration remains consistent, transparent, and accessible to everyone.

For example, a marketing manager preparing for a quarterly review can use Copilot to pull summaries from multiple campaign meetings and compare outcomes. Instead of piecing together notes from dozens of files, they can see which strategies performed best, what decisions were made, and where additional resources are needed. This proactive use of Copilot turns past conversations into data-driven insight.

Now that you’ve seen how Copilot captures insights after a meeting, it’s time to practice using it yourself to generate a summary and identify next steps.
