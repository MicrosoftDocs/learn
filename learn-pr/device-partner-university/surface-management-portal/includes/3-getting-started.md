## Getting started

To use Security Copilot in the Surface Management Portal, a Microsoft Intune license and available Security Compute Units (SCU) for Security Copilot are required.

Let’s go through the steps.

First, work with billing administrators to add capacity (Security Compute Units) for Security Copilot in the same tenant as the Surface Management Portal.
