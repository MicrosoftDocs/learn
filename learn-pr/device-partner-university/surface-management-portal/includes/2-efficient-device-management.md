## Efficient device management

Surface Management Portal empowers users to easily monitor, manage, and self-serve their devices in one convenient place. This allows them to gain insights, simplify tasks, get notified, and save time.

Now with the power of Security Copilot, managing devices is even more efficient. Powered by [Surface documentation](/surface/get-started), Security Copilot provides guided answers for quicker resolutions for device repairs—saving time and improving end user uptime.

### Streamlining workflows

Surface Management Portal centralizes Surface device management within Intune, giving IT teams a unified interface to manage devices at scale throughout their lifecycle.

Copilot enhances this experience by assisting with troubleshooting, summarizing warranty status, and providing best practices to maximize device performance.

### Copilot enhancements

Copilot integrates Surface documentation with tenant data to deliver contextually relevant insights. For example, it can compare official Surface driver and firmware lifecycle documentation against the lifecycle data of devices within the users’ tenant.
In a single click, Copilot generates a table highlighting which devices are nearing end of service—enabling IT to plan proactively.
Previously, this process required manually reconciling data from multiple sources, spending more time and reducing efficiency.

### Highlighting key information

Copilot makes it easy for IT pros who are new to their roles to get started with Surface device management. Instead of reviewing different resources, they can rely on Copilot to highlight key information and guide them through tasks—ensuring productivity on day one.
