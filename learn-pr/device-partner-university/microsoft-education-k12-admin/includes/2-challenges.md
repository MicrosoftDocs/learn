There isn't a single model for K-12 school systems around the world. Even schools within the same geopolitical area might have different organizational structures.

This means that the word 'administrators' can signify a wide range of roles—like principals, superintendents, school board members, district administrators, department directors, instructional coaches, and more.

Regardless of their specific role, K-12 administrators share many common challenges.

## Security and trust

K-12 administrators are deeply concerned with protecting their students’ and institution’s data.

Not only are data breaches potentially costly to recover from, they also expose school systems to liability claims and erode trust within their communities.

## Financial constraints

K-12 administrators want to make the most out of their budgets.

They don’t want to spend funds on solutions that their school communities can’t or won’t use—especially given the limited amount of money they have to spend.

## Technology challenges

K-12 administrators also might need support in understanding new technologies.

They might not have a solid understanding of how innovations like AI can help them and their school systems. At the same time, they don’t want to invest in solutions that will quickly become obsolete or don’t meet the needs of their students and teachers.
