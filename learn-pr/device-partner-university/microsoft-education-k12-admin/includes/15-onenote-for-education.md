OneNote for Education also offers administrators a powerful tool to help keep their institutions organized and efficient.

## Content is all in one place

OneNote is a powerful note-taking app that allows administrators, educators, and students to add notes and contentâ€”and then search for what they need.

## Access notes anywhere, anytime

OneNote notebooks can be accessed and edited from anywhere, on any device, at any time. Edits made on one device will carry across devices.

## Accessible for all

Users can take notes by typing, speaking, or with digital ink, using either a stylus or a fingertip. Multimedia like videos and pictures can also be added for a richer experience.
