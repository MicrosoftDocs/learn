Finally, let’s talk about accessibility. Microsoft Education solutions provide accessibility tools at no additional cost. These include features designed to help students focus on reading, narrate their thoughts out loud with speech-to-text, and more.

Let’s focus on two that can help administrators every day.

Administrators regularly have to send communications to many people—often with differing accessibility needs—at once. Accessibility Assistant, found in applications like Word, PowerPoint, and OneNote, quickly scans files and offers immediate fixes for any identified accessibility issue.

Microsoft Translator helps bridge communication gaps between administrators and multilingual speakers. With the conversations feature, administrators can have real-time conversations with automatic two-way translation that helps connect and communicate with families.
