A OneNote Staff Notebook is a digital notebook that helps facilitate collaboration at the school and district levels.

Let's take a look at the parts of a Staff Notebookâ€”and learn why they benefit administrators.

## Staff Member Notebooks

Staff Member Notebooks provide a private space shared only between staff leaders and individual staff members. Administrators can use these to easily share observation notes, lesson plan feedback, and more.

## Content Library

The Content Library is a space where read-only documents and files can be uploaded and accessed by staff team members. Administrators can use this to share essential information, like schedules, handbooks, and updates.

## Collaboration Space

Here, all members of a staff team can share, organize, and collaborate in a single place. Administrators can use this space to boost collaboration on lesson or unit plans, larger initiatives, events, and more.

## Leader-only Section

The Leader-only Section is a private space that only staff team owners and co-owners can access. Administrators can use it for drafting meeting agendas, preplanning materials, and sharing confidential information.
