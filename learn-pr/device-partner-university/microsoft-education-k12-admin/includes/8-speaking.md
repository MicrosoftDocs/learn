Public speaking can be scary and difficult to practice. Microsoft Education has developed two Learning Accelerators to help students develop skills in giving presentations—and to provide educators and administrators with the data they need to advance their students' skills.

## Speaker Coach

Speaker Coach helps evaluate students’ public speaking performances and gives personalized feedback—all without the stress of a live audience. 

### Benefits

Speaker Coach provides personalized feedback on students' speaking skills, helping them refine their delivery and build confidence.

It allows students to practice their public speaking without the need for an audience—enabling more students to get practice at once, and making better use of instructional time.

The improvements in student confidence might also lead to better performance in school and extracurricular activities.

## Speaker Progress

Speaker Progress helps educators and administrators monitor data on student public speaking skills from Speaker Coach—and track progress over time. 

### Benefits

Speaker Progress offers detailed insights into students' speaking abilities, allowing administrators to track progress over time.

With this data, administrators can better plan for support services and interventions. They can see if there are particular groups of students who need more support, and ensure they're provided with the help they need. This can have a positive effect on both individual students and the school as a whole.
