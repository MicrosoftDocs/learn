Following the phishing incident involving Hana Sykorova, the Maple School of Fine Arts board requests a formal report detailing what happened, how it was handled, and what steps are being taken to prevent future incidents. You need to generate a clear, professional summary that can be shared with nontechnical stakeholders.

Steps:
1. Return to Security Copilot
   - Open the Microsoft Defender XDR portal.
   - Navigate to the Security Copilot interface.
   - Enter the prompt: *"Generate a report for school leadership about the phishing incident on October 28 involving hana@fineartschool.net."*

2. Review the draft report

   Ensure it includes:
   - **Incident summary**: What happened and when, and how it was detected.
   - **Timeline**: Key events and timestamps, such as when the email was received, reported, investigated, and resolved.
   - **Impact**: Number of users affected, data exposure (if any), systems involved.
   - **Actions taken**: Investigation steps, user notifications, remediation.
   - **Recommendations**: Future prevention strategies such as policy updates, training needs, or technical controls.

3. Customize the report:
   
   Add school-specific context, for example:
   - *"No student data was compromised."*
   - *"The incident was contained within two hours."*
   - *“Staff will receive updated phishing awareness training."*
   
   Adjust tone and terminology for a nontechnical audience.

4. Export and distribute
   - Export the report to Word or PDF.
   - Share it with school leadership via secure channels.

5. Optional: Create a parent-facing summary

   - Ask Copilot: *"Summarize this incident in plain language for parents of Maple School of Fine Arts students."*
   - Review the output for accuracy, appropriate tone, and thoroughness.
   - Use this version for newsletters or parent communications.

6. Optional: Generate a follow-up checklist
   - Prompt Copilot to:
   *"Create a checklist of follow-up actions for the IT team after this phishing incident."*
   - Use this to track remediation and training tasks.

You’ve now created a professional, AI-assisted report in minutes—saving time and improving clarity. This builds confidence in your team’s ability to manage threats.
