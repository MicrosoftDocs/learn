You’ve now learned how to investigate a phishing attack and generate a professional incident report using Microsoft Security Copilot in an educational setting. But your journey doesn’t stop here. Security Copilot is a powerful tool that becomes even more effective when paired with other Microsoft security solutions and real-world practice.

Here are some ways to continue building your skills and applying what you’ve learned:

## Practice in a safe environment

If your organization has access to a test tenant or sandbox environment, try replicating the exercises from this module using real tools.

Practice:

- Investigating simulated phishing emails
- Generating reports for different audiences (for example, IT, leadership, parents)
- Asking Copilot to summarize incidents from Microsoft Defender or Microsoft Sentinel

- [Microsoft Security Copilot Frequently Asked Questions](/copilot/security/faq-security-copilot?source=recommendations)

## Build your own prompts

Experiment with crafting your own natural language prompts in Security Copilot. Try:

- *"Summarize all incidents from the past seven days."*
- *"List devices with compliance issues in the art department."*
- *"Generate a report on risky sign-ins for staff accounts."*

The more you practice, the more fluent you’ll become in using Copilot as a daily security assistant.

## Check out Security Copilot agents

Microsoft Security Copilot agents automate repetitive tasks and reduce manual workloads, improving efficiency across cloud, data security and privacy, identity, and network security. By combining data and code with an AI language model, agents handle high-volume, time-consuming tasks and respond to both user requests and system events. This helps security and IT teams focus on higher-impact work.

Agents integrate seamlessly into existing workflows—no special training or extra licensing is required. They operate using Security Compute Units (SCUs), just like other Security Copilot features, and connect easily with Microsoft Security solutions and partner integrations. Agents continually learn from feedback while keeping you in control of their actions. They can automate resource-intensive tasks such as creating threat intelligence briefings or optimizing Conditional Access policies.

With Microsoft Security Copilot agents, organizations can scale their security operations, increase efficiency, and strengthen resilience. By automating routine processes, teams can dedicate more time to strategic initiatives, complex investigations, and rapid response to emerging threats.
