Cybersecurity threats in education are rising at an alarming rate. From phishing emails targeting teachers to ransomware attacks that lock down entire school networks, educational institutions are increasingly vulnerable. These threats not only disrupt learning but also put sensitive student and staff data at risk.

Yet many schools operate with limited IT resources. Security teams are often small, overburdened, and reactive rather than proactive. This is where Microsoft Security Copilot comes in.

Security Copilot is a generative AI assistant that helps security professionals investigate, respond to, and learn from threats faster and more effectively. It integrates with Microsoft’s security tools—like Microsoft Defender XDR and Microsoft Sentinel—to provide real-time insights and guided responses.
