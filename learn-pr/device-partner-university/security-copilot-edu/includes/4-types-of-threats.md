Educational institutions face a unique set of cybersecurity challenges. Unlike corporate environments, schools often have:

- A wide range of users (students, teachers, staff, parents)
- Limited budgets for security tools and training
- Open networks to support learning and collaboration

These factors make schools attractive targets for cybercriminals. Common threats include:

- **Phishing Attacks**: Emails that appear to come from trusted sources (like school administrators) but are designed to steal credentials or install malware.

- **Ransomware**: Malicious software that encrypts school data and demands payment for its release. This can disrupt classes, delay exams, and compromise student records.

- **Unauthorized Access**: Students or outsiders gaining access to systems they shouldn’t, either through weak passwords or social engineering.

- **Data Breaches**: Sensitive information—such as student health records or staff payroll data—being exposed due to poor security practices or targeted attacks.

Security Copilot helps mitigate these risks by analyzing signals from Microsoft Defender, Microsoft Sentinel, and other tools. It surfaces anomalies, suggests next steps, and even drafts communications to stakeholders.
