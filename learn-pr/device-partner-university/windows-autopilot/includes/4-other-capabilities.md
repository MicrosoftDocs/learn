Windows Autopilot functional and critical updates automatically download during the out-of-the-box experience. They launch after:

- The device is connected to a network.
- Critical driver and Windows updates are complete.

End users can’t opt out of these updates.

## BitLocker encryption

With Windows Autopilot, you can configure BitLocker encryption settings to apply before automatic encryption starts.

By doing so, you can enforce an organization’s security policies or requirements right from the start of the device setup process—ensuring consistency, compliance, and enhanced protection for sensitive data.

To learn how to configure these settings, visit [Microsoft Learn](/autopilot/bitlocker).

## Pre-provisioning

Pre-provisioning enhances efficiency and boosts user satisfaction during the initial device setup.

This process takes place between the time the device leaves the factory and when it arrives at the end user. During this phase, an IT technician performs intermediate but automatic configurations, such as installing apps and adjusting settings.

As a result, when end users sign in for the first time, they don't have to wait for any configurations to complete—they can jump right in and start using their device.

## Common challenges

**Deploying and configuring devices so an end user can set it up themselves**
[Windows Autopilot user-driven mode](/autopilot/user-driven) lets you configure new Windows devices to automatically transform from their factory state to a ready-to-use state.

**Deploying devices automatically configured for shared use, as a kiosk, or as a digital signage device**
[Windows Autopilot self-deploying mode](/autopilot/self-deploying) lets you deploy a device as a kiosk, digital signage device, or a shared device with little to no user interaction.

**Redeploying devices in a business-ready state**
[Windows Autopilot Reset](/autopilot/windows-autopilot-reset) takes the device back to a business-ready state, allowing the next person to sign in and get productive quickly and simply.

**Reducing the time spent deploying devices** 
[Windows Autopilot device preparation](/autopilot/device-preparation/overview) simplifies device deployment by delivering consistent configurations, enhancing the overall setup speed, and improving troubleshooting capabilities.
