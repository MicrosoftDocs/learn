Microsoft Teams provides tools for organizing and managing meetings within a team or organization. Scheduling meetings manually can lead to missed invitations, scheduling conflicts, and confusion about participant roles.

Imagine you’re responsible for coordinating weekly project meetings for your team. You need a reliable way to set up recurring meetings, ensure all necessary participants are invited, and manage meeting options such as who can present or join directly. When done manually, this can take a long time—and can lead to mistakes like forgotten invites or incorrect meeting settings. Consider how much time is wasted in a meeting when the lead presenter can’t share their screen—or a large audience can unmute themselves at will! Automating these tasks helps reduce errors and saves time.

By the end of this module, you’ll be able to automate meeting scheduling and manage meeting options in the new calendar view of Microsoft Teams.

## Learning objectives

- Schedule recurring meetings faster using the new calendar view in Microsoft Teams.
