Microsoft Teams meetings have three main roles:

- **Organizer:** Schedules the meeting and controls its settings.
- **Presenter:** Shares content, manages participants, and controls meeting features.
- **Attendee:** Joins, views shared content, and participates, but has limited controls.

Each role comes with different permissions, so itâ€™s important to assign them appropriately based on the needs of your meeting.

## Access and adjust meeting options before a meeting

Before your meeting starts, you can set options to control how participants join and interact:

- Key settings include:
  - **Who can bypass the lobby:** Decide if everyone, only people in your organization, or only you can join directly.
  - **Who can present:** Choose whether everyone, specific people, or only the organizer can present.
  - **Attendee mic and camera permissions:** Allow or block attendees from unmuting themselves or turning on their cameras.

Adjust these options to match the needs and security requirements of your meeting.

## Manage participant permissions during a meeting

During the meeting, organizers and presenters can manage participant permissions in real time:

- **Spotlight a presenter:** Keep their video visible to all participants.
- **Mute attendees:** Reduce background noise by muting all or individual participants.
- **Admit participants from the lobby:** Control who joins the meeting and when.
- **Change roles:** Promote an attendee to presenter if needed.

These controls help maintain order and ensure the meeting runs smoothly.

## Best practices for meeting control

Keep these best practices in mind as you determine your meeting controls.

- Assign presenter roles only to those who need to share content or manage the meeting.
- Use the lobby feature for sensitive meetings to control who joins.
- Mute attendees during presentations to minimize distractions.
- Regularly review and adjust meeting options to maintain security and order.
- Communicate meeting roles and expectations to participants ahead of time.
