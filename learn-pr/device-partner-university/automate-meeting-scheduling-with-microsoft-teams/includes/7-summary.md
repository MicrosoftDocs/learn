Coordinating regular team meetings can be challenging, especially when scheduling conflicts, missed invitations, and unclear participant roles disrupt collaboration. In this module, you learned how to use Microsoft Teams to automate meeting scheduling and manage meeting options. You scheduled recurring meetings using Teams calendar integration and configured participant roles and permissions to ensure meetings run smoothly.

Without these automation tools, you would need to manually coordinate schedules, send individual invites, and manage participant permissions during each meeting—an inefficient process prone to errors and wasted time. By using Microsoft Teams’ scheduling and meeting management features, you save time, reduce mistakes, and help your team collaborate more effectively. This streamlined approach improves meeting reliability and frees up time for more productive work.
