Managing how participants join and interact in a meeting is key to running effective sessions. In this exercise, you’ll configure meeting options before the meeting starts and practice managing participant roles and permissions during the meeting. You’ll learn how to control who can present, who can bypass the lobby, and how to adjust permissions in real time to keep your meetings organized and secure.

1. Open a scheduled meeting in Microsoft Teams.
   1. Go to the Calendar tab and select the meeting you want to configure.

1. Choose the scope of meetings to be edited.
   1. At the top of the Event instance pop-up, a message appears explaining that you're editing one event in the series.
   1. If you only need to change the meeting options for the selected date and time, move onto the next step.
   1. If you want to change meeting options moving forward, select **Edit series** (this will apply the changes retroactively) or **Edit this and all following events** (this will apply the changes to the current meeting and all future ones.)
