Microsoft Teams includes a built-in calendar that helps you organize and manage meetings for your team. The Teams calendar is fully integrated with Outlook, so any meeting you create in Teams will automatically appear in your Outlook calendar, and vice versa. This integration keeps your schedule consistent across both platforms and makes it easier to keep track of upcoming meetings.

## Types of meetings you can schedule

You can schedule several types of meetings in Teams:

- **One-time meetings:** Set for a specific date and time and don't repeat.
- **Recurring meetings:** Repeat at intervals you choose, such as daily, weekly, or monthly. Useful for regular team check-ins or project updates.
- **Channel meetings:** Linked to a specific Teams channel, allowing all channel members to join and access meeting resources. Helpful for team-wide discussions or ongoing projects.

## How meeting invitations sync across Teams and Outlook

Meeting invitations and updates are automatically synced between Teams and Outlook. If you change the meeting time, add participants, or update other details, those changes will be reflected in both calendars. Attendees receive notifications and calendar updates, helping everyone stay informed and prepared.

## Best practices for setting up recurring meetings

Keep these best practices in mind for successful meetings.

- **Confirm participant availability:** Check team members’ calendars to avoid conflicts.
- **Use clear, descriptive meeting titles:** Help attendees identify the purpose of the meeting.
- **Set an agenda:** Include a brief agenda in the meeting invite.

  >[!TIP]
  > You can add an agenda by selecting “Add an agenda” at the very bottom of the event window in Microsoft Teams. This agenda is powered by Microsoft Loop. By default, anyone invited to the meeting can edit this agenda.
  >
  >Note that permissions may be restricted by tenant admin settings in some organizations.
