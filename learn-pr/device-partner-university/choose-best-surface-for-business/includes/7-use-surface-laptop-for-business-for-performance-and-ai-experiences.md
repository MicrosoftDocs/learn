In our scenario, users who manage the commercial sales team need a device that can support demanding workloads and handle advanced AI features. Managers run complex spreadsheets, participate in video conferences, and use AI-powered tools to maximize their efficiency. They need a device that delivers strong performance and integrates seamlessly with AI experiences.

For these users, they need a device that can ensure smooth multitasking and responsiveness for resource-intensive applications. Surface Laptop for Business is their best solution.

**Analysis of the criteria:** In our scenario, we're looking at a device for a manager of a commercial selling team. These users are looking for performance above all else. With Surface Laptop for Business, users get the best performance from multiple silicon options.

Surface Laptop for Business offers users the option of Intel Core Ultra (Series 2) or Qualcomm Snapdragon® X Plus / X Elite processors. Intel models feature the Intel Core Ultra 5 (236V, 238V) or Intel Core Ultra 7 (266V, 268V) processors. These processors deliver trusted x86 compatibility—ensuring seamless performance with the deepest catalog of Windows applications and enterprise software. Models that feature Qualcomm Snapdragon® X Plus / X Elite processors are optimized for power efficiency and AI workloads, emphasizing local AI processing with the Qualcomm Hexagon NPU (neural processing unit) that's capable of up to 45 TOPS (trillions of operations per second).

Both processor platforms deliver high-end performance and enable users to get their work done depending on their needs and workflows.

| **Feature** | **Intel Core Ultra (Series 2)** | **Qualcomm Snapdragon**® **X Plus/ X Elite** |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Core count | Up to eight cores | X Plus: Eight cores X Elite: 12 cores |
| AI acceleration | Intel AI Boost, up to 48 TOPS | Qualcomm Hexagon NPU, up to 45 TOPS |
| Battery | Optimized for all-day productivity | Extended battery life for mobile use |
| Compatibility | Broad support for Windows apps | Optimized for modern apps and ARM-native software |
| Security features | TPM 2.0 (Trusted Platform Module) BitLocker Microsoft Pluton Windows Autopilot | TPM 2.0 (Trusted Platform Module) BitLocker Microsoft Pluton Windows Autopilot |

Both processor models offer users with enterprise-grade level performance that's optimized for AI—ensuring that tasks are completed efficiently and smoothly. With business features like BitLocker, TPM 2.0, and Windows Autopilot, users are productive and secure—giving them peace of mind while they focus on work. Lastly, these devices balance the performance metrics while also providing extended battery life for mobile use.

**Why other options are suboptimal:** While all Surface for Business devices can handle AI workloads and offer excellent performance, the combination of power with security features help to set Surface Laptop for Business apart for power users. Let's explore why.

- *Surface Pro for Business:* This device offers excellent power and portability, but when compared to a traditional laptop form factor it's less suited for sustained heavy workloads. It contains a smaller thermal envelope that limits device performance under prolonged multitasking when compared to Surface Laptop for Business.
- *Surface Laptop 13-inch:* This device as mentioned in previous units offers an excellent combination of battery life and portability. But it also features a processor (Snapdragon® X Plus [8 Core] X1P-42-100) that has a slower clock speed and fewer cores—making it less ideal for performance intensive tasks. While this processor offers strong AI capabilities, the processors on Surface Laptop for Business offer slightly stronger AI processing capabilities.
- *Surface Pro 12-inch:* This device is intended for maximum portability with its smaller 12-inch display and lightweight build. But this means that it has less high-end performance capabilities for power users. It isn't designed for enterprise-grade AI workflows or heavy multitasking, making Surface Laptop for Business a better option for these users.

For users that prioritize performance and utilizing AI experiences as a part of their daily workflow, Surface Laptop for Business offers the best combination of speed, enterprise security, and AI integration. It's ideal for professionals who need a secure, high-performance device for advanced productivity.
