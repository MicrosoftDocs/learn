When considering our scenario of a commercial sales team, there are various worker types that need reliable battery life—such as a frequent traveler, remote worker, or event presenter. These types of users get work done in a wide array of locations where power isn't guaranteed, requiring a device that can execute their tasks and have enough endurance to make it through the workday.

For these users, a device with long run time is essential but it must also be portable enough to not be burdensome when going from location to location. Surface Laptop 13-inch is the best solution for these users.

**Analysis of the criteria:** Surface Laptop 13-inch features exceptional battery life—designed for all-day use and often outperforming hybrid devices in longevity. When compared to other Surface for Business devices in local video playback and web usage endurance, Surface Laptop 13-inch provides the longest runtime.

| **Device** | **Hours of local video playback** | **Hours of active web usage** |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Surface Laptop 13-inch | 23 hours | 16 hours |
| Surface Laptop for Business 13.8-inch | 20 hours | 13 hours |
| Surface Laptop for Business 15-inch | 22 hours | 15 hours |
| Surface Pro for Business | 14 hours | 10 hours |
| Surface Pro 12-inch | 16 hours | 12 hours |

While preserving battery life, this doesn't come at the expense of performance. Equipped with the Qualcomm Snapdragon® X Plus (eight Core) X1P-42-100 processor and Qualcomm Hexagon NPU with 45 TOPS (trillions of operations per second), Surface Laptop 13-inch is designed to accomplish AI-enhanced tasks. Features such as Live Captions, Recall (preview), Windows Studio Effects, and others are available to make routine daily tasks easier.

For the users in our scenario, balancing battery life and portability is a must. Among other Surface laptops, Surface Laptop 13-inch offers a lighter weight build for enhanced portability. While heavier than Surface Pro models, the multiple hours of longer battery life offered by Surface Laptop 13-inch a better balance for these users.

| **Device** | **Weight (in lbs)** | **Weight (in kgs)** |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Surface Laptop 13-inch | 2.7 lbs | 1.22 kg |
| Surface Laptop for Business 13.8-inch | 2.97 lbs | 1.35 kg |
| Surface Laptop for Business 15-inch | 3.66 lbs | 1.66 kg |
| Surface Pro for Business | 1.92 kg | 0.87 kg |
| Surface Pro 12-inch | 1.5 lbs | 0.68 kg |

**Analysis of why other options are suboptimal:** When it comes battery life prioritization, Surface Laptop 13-inch offers the best combination of longevity, portability, and performance for everyday productivity use cases. Let's explore why other Surface for Business devices don't strike as well of a balance for these users.

- *Surface Pro 12-inch:* The smaller footprint of this device makes it excellent for those users that focus solely on portability. However, it offers shorter runtime due to its smaller chassis and may require frequent charging in between power-intensive tasks, such as video calling.
- *Surface Pro for Business:* This device excels from a security standpoint when compared to other options. Its lower weight is also ideal from a portability perspective, but its battery longevity is lower than Surface Laptop 13-inch—meaning that it isn't as suitable for long, unplugged sessions.
- *Surface Laptop for Business:* This is the most viable alternative to Surface Laptop 13-inch. It sacrifices some portability in terms of weight, especially with the 15-inch variant. Battery life is comparable but is still slightly lower than Surface Laptop 13-inch. It offers more business features not available on Surface Laptop 13-inch, but that may not be as much of a factor for users that are focused on battery life over other features.
