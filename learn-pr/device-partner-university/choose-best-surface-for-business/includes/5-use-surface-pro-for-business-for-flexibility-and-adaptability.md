In our scenario, you're analyzing what the best device is for a commercial sales team. Consider a manager that works from their desk but also needs to be productive during meetings and at other events. Having a device that offers power and adaptability to different venues is crucial to remaining efficient.

For these users, they need a device with versatility, a color accurate display, and support for multimonitor experiences with performance that keeps up with their workflow. Surface Pro for Business is their best solution.

**Analysis of the criteria:** Surface Pro for Business offers hardware flexibility and performance that allows users to be adaptable. As a 2-in-1 device, Surface Pro for Business allows users to use it as a tablet or as a laptop when needed. But what makes it stand out as a great option for managers is that when it's paired with the Surface Pro 13-inch Flex Keyboard for Business, they can use the keyboard without it being attached to the device. This enables a laptop-to-desktop workflow that can dynamically change based on their use case.

With its 13" PixelSense™ Flow display, Surface Pro 13-inch provides ample real estate while remaining portable. Available in both LCD (liquid crystal display) and OLED (organic light-emitting diode) options, Surface Pro for Business provides the following display features that provide enhanced viewing experiences:

- Resolution: 2880 x 1920 (267 pixels per inch)
- Aspect ratio: 3:2 for better viewing of vertical content
- Dynamic refresh rate: Up to 120 Hz
- Color profile: sRGB and Vivid
- Touch: 10-point multi-touch
- Anti-reflective display, ISO 9241-307 certified1

Performance is also key to the experience for these users with Surface Pro for Business. With the inclusion of USB-C/USB4 ports, managers can easily connect docking stations, monitors, and removable storage with support for fast charging2, data transfer, and 4K monitors. Surface Pro for Business allows managers of a sales team to stay nimble, productive, and flexible.

**Analysis of why other options are suboptimal:** Surface Pro for Business is a 2-in-1 device, which makes it a more adaptable form factor than a traditional laptop. The ability to go from touch-only to a full laptop experience makes it a better fit for managers that may be moving throughout the office to get work done. The addition of the Surface Pro 13-inch Flex Keyboard makes it an even better solution for these users over Surface Pro 12-inch because the keyboard doesn't need to be attached to the device—creating more flexibility and setup freedom.

Surface Pro for Business also offers a more vivid and interactive display experience. When compared to Surface Pro 12-inch it has a larger display, with a higher refresh rate, and anti-reflective glass. While Surface Laptop 13-inch and Surface Laptop for Business also have large screens, they lack pen support and tablet mode. As a result, Surface Pro for Business offers richer interaction options with better display adaptability.

| **Feature** | **Surface Pro for Business** | **Surface Pro 12-inch** | **Surface Laptop 13-inch** | **Surface Laptop for Business** |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Form factor | 2-in-1 Detachable | 2-in-1 Detachable | Clamshell only | Clamshell only |
| Display | 13" OLED optional | 12" LCD | 13" LCD | 13.8" or 15" OLED optional |

| Security | Pluton, Autopilot, NFC (near field communication) | Pluton, Autopilot | Pluton, Autopilot | Pluton, Autopilot |

Surface Pro for Business is the only option that combines tablet portability, laptop power, pen input, and enterprise-grade security in one package. It offers premium display features, AI acceleration, and optional 5G that's ideal for managers that move around the office and to various locations.
