For a traveling commercial sales team, having a device that's easy to transport and can function in various conditions is important. These users need a device that can be carried easily with enough performance to execute their daily tasks.

For these users, some important factors to consider are weight, battery life, screen size, and input variety. Microsoft Surface Pro 12-inch is the ideal choice for these needs:

| **Device** | **Weight** | **Screen size** | **Input methods** |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Microsoft Surface Pro 12-inch | 1.5 lbs | 12-inch | Touch Trackpad Surface Slim Pen (2nd Edition) |
| Microsoft Surface Laptop 13-inch | 2.7 lbs | 13-inch | Touch Trackpad |
| Microsoft Surface Pro for Business | 1.97 lbs | 13-inch | Touch Trackpad Surface Slim Pen (2nd Edition) |
| Microsoft Surface Laptop for Business | 2.96 lbs - 3.67 lbs | 13.8-inch 15-inch | Touch Trackpad |

**Analysis of the criteria:** Surface Pro 12-inch offers a blend of flexibility and portability that's ideal for a traveling commercial sales team. Its 1.5-lb weight makes it the lightest Surface for Business device while meeting the performance needs of these users. The option of using the device as a tablet or as a laptop hybrid with the Surface Pro 12-inch Keyboard attached offers compact flexibility that helps them get their work done.

Surface Pro 12-inch still offers similar secure experiences to other Surface for Business devices that's crucial to users that are accessing company data in various locations. It features enhanced security with Microsoft Pluton TPM 2.0 (Trusted Platform Module) and BitLocker support. Surface Pro 12-inch is also a Secured Core PC—designed to protect against malware attacks by securing sensitive data at the firmware level.

The combination of enhanced portability and secure experiences makes Surface Pro 12-inch an ideal choice for the users in our scenario of a traveling salesperson.

**Analysis of why other options are suboptimal:** Other Surface for Business devices match the Surface Pro 12-inch in security but have greater weight, reducing portability. Surface Laptop devices trade off some portability for a larger display, in addition to lacking the hybrid functionality of a 2-in-1 device and the lack of pen support.

Surface Pro for Business offers many of the benefits of Surface Pro 12-inch, such as 2-in-1 form factor and pen support. But it's a larger and heavier device, which limits some of its appeal as a travel companion.

All Surface for Business devices are meant to be portable and long lasting, but Surface Pro 12-inch is the most portable, which is important to consider for a traveling sales team that values portability above other needs.
