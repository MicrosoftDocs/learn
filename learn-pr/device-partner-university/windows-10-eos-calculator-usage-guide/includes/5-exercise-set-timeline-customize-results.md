A well-planned upgrade timeline helps your organization control costs, minimize risk, and keep productivity high. The Windows 10 EOS Calculator makes it easy to visualize different rollout strategies and compare their impact.

In this exercise, you’ll practice setting your upgrade cadence, customizing scenario details, and exporting a report to share with stakeholders. These steps will help you build a clear, actionable modernization plan.

1. Set your upgrade timeline
   1. In the **Upgrade Timeline** section, enter the percentage of devices you plan to refresh each year.
   1. For example, you might enter **40% in Year 1**, **40% in Year 2**, and **20% in Year 3**.
   1. Adjust these numbers to fit your organization’s needs—spread upgrades out or accelerate to reduce risk.

   > [!NOTE]
   > The timeline you set determines how quickly you reduce support costs and security risks.

2. Refine your scenario with Additional options
   1. Toggle **Additional options** to On.

   1. Enter details to customize your calculations:
      - Estimated annual revenue
      - Percentage of devices not eligible for Windows 11
      - Typical device refresh cycle (in years)
      - Average employee salary
      - Average IT admin salary
      - Annual cost of productivity and security software
      - Average cost to upgrade a device for Windows 11
      - Whether updates are managed with a Microsoft cloud solution
   1. Review and adjust any default values to match your organization for more accurate results.

   > [!TIP]
   > If you have both cloud-managed and on-premises devices, model them separately for more precise insights.

1. Review initial results  
   1. After entering your data, the **right pane** displays a summary of your scenario.  
   1. You’ll see key metrics such as:  
      - **Estimated ROI** and **net present value (NPV)**  
      - **Cost of Extended Security Updates (ESUs)**  
      - **Devices upgraded per quarter**  
      - **Total benefits and costs over three years**  
   1. The calculator also compares your timeline to an expedited upgrade path, helping you visualize tradeoffs in cost, risk, and payback.
