With Windows 10 support now ending, organizations often rely on rough estimates and gut feel to plan upgrades—leading to hidden ESU costs, extended exposure to security risk, and timelines that slip as budgets and device lifecycles collide. In this module, you replaced guesswork with a structured approach. You entered baseline data into the Windows 10 EOS Calculator, refined assumptions in **Additional options**, compared phased and accelerated timelines, and exported a clear PDF to brief stakeholders. That workflow turned scattered inputs into a single picture of cost, risk, and ROI—so finance, IT, and security leaders can evaluate tradeoffs using the same facts.

Without a shared model, decisions stall: **Extended Security Updates** spend compounds year over year, legacy support effort grows, and teams debate priorities without a common baseline. The Windows 10 EOS Calculator closes those gaps by translating your environment into research-backed estimates and side-by-side scenarios. With a few inputs, you can show how timing affects payback, where to prioritize device refresh, and how cloud-managed updates improve efficiency—then turn those insights into a wave-by-wave plan aligned to budget windows and procurement lead times.

The result isn’t just a one-time analysis—it’s a repeatable way to plan modernization. Revisit the Windows 10 EOS Calculator as pilots finish, assumptions sharpen, or supply changes, and regenerate the report to keep leadership aligned. By grounding your Windows 11 transition in data instead of assumptions, you accelerate decisions, reduce risk, and give your organization a consistent path to modern, secure, and productive devices.
