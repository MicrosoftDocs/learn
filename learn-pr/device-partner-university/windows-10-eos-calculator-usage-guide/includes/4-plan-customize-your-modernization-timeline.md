Modernization isn’t a single moment—it’s a sequence of pilots and waves. The calculator helps you visualize how different cadences affect cost, risk, and payback so you can balance urgency with feasibility and align to your fiscal calendar and procurement lead times.

## Timing considerations after EOS

For organizations still running Windows 10:
- **Extended Security Updates (ESU)** are available at a cost and typically increase annually.  
- **Hardware limitations** can restrict device eligibility for Windows 11, which may require replacement instead of in-place upgrades.  
- **Operational delays** tend to drive productivity losses and higher support overhead as legacy issues accumulate.

## Customizing inputs for accuracy

Open the calculator’s **Additional options** section and enter:

- **Estimated annual revenue**  
- **Percentage of devices not eligible for Windows 11**  
- **Typical device refresh cycle (in years)**  
- **Average employee salary**  
- **Average IT admin salary**  
- **Annual cost of productivity and security software**  
- **Average cost of a device upgraded for Windows 11**  
- **Whether updates are managed with a Microsoft cloud solution**

> [!TIP]
> If compensation ranges aren’t available, use conservative medians. Re-run the model with HR-provided figures later and compare the deltas in the PDF export.

## Testing different scenarios

Use the calculator to simulate modernization paths that match your constraints:

- **Phased upgrade:** devices refreshed gradually (for example, 40/40/20 across three years).  
- **Accelerated upgrade:** complete migration within 6–12 months post-EOS.  
- **Minimal upgrade with ESU:** limited device replacement while purchasing ESU.

Running at least two timelines creates a side-by-side comparison that often clarifies the business case.

### Example scenario (organizations)

Contoso Services operates **350 Windows 10 devices**, with **25% not eligible** for Windows 11. IT manages updates through a **hybrid model** (Intune + on-premius tools).  
They test two timelines in the calculator:

- **Phased (40/40/20 over 3 years):** spreads CAPEX, allows app remediation, but prolongs ESU exposure and legacy support effort.  
- **Accelerated (100% within 12 months):** compresses training and procurement windows, reduces ESU exposure sooner, and typically shortens payback because security and admin-efficiency benefits land earlier.

> [!NOTE]
> Use the same inputs across both runs (device counts, salaries, refresh assumptions) and change **only** the timeline. This keeps comparisons fair and makes the tradeoffs clear in your PDF.

## Reading the results

The results view summarizes each scenario with charts and tables. Focus on:
- **ROI and payback period**  
- **ESU and legacy support costs**  
- **Security exposure**  
- **IT efficiency**

> [!TIP]
> When presenting results, lead with ROI, payback period, and ESU savings. These metrics resonate with finance and executive stakeholders and help secure buy-in.

## From numbers to a plan

Turn the outputs into a simple, reusable plan:
- **Executive summary**  
- **Key metrics**  
- **Rollout waves**  
- **Risks & mitigations**  
- **Dependencies**

Ready to put your planning into action? In this exercise, you’ll define your upgrade cadence, adjust key assumptions, and compare side-by-side scenarios. The goal is to generate a personalized report that supports executive decision-making and helps align your modernization strategy with business priorities.
