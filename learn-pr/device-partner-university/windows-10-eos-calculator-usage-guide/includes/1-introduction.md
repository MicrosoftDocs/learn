Windows 10 support has ended, and organizations need a clear, data-driven path to modernize on Windows 11 so teams remain productive and protected. Many businesses struggle to estimate the costs, risks, and benefits of upgrading: How large is the exposure if we delay? What’s the ROI if we accelerate? Which timeline best fits our device mix and budget cycles?

Imagine you're an IT decision-maker responsible for guiding your organization through the transition from Windows 10 to Windows 11. Support for Windows 10 has officially ended, and now you're faced with critical questions to answer those questions.

It helps IT leaders move beyond reactive budgeting and toward proactive planning—aligning modernization with business goals, security posture, and workforce productivity.
