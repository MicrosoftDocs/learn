A Copilot+ PC is a type of Windows 11 PC that has a Neural Processing Unit (NPU) capable of 40+ TOPS (trillions of operations per second).

A Neural Processing Unit, or NPU, is a specialized microchip designed to run AI processes. It enables on-device processing for some AI workloads—allowing for faster speeds and greater privacy. TOPS is a metric used to measure the theoretical peak performance of AI hardware like NPUs. It indicates how many basic operations, such as additions and multiplications, the hardware can perform in one second. In short, the higher the TOPS, the greater the AI processing capacity of an NPU.

In addition, every Copilot+ PC comes with a Copilot key.

## Copilot key

The Copilot key, announced in January 2024, represented the first major change to the Windows PC keyboard in nearly three decades. Originally, pressing the Copilot key would open Copilot in Windows. However, as the Copilot experience has evolved, this functionality has changed.

On older devices with the Copilot key mapped to the Copilot app, the Copilot key still retains that mapping unless changed manually.

For commercial users (signed in with a Microsoft Entra account), the Copilot key should be remapped to open the Microsoft 365 app, which includes enterprise-grade Copilot experiences. New devices automatically default to this behavior when set up using a Microsoft Entra account.

For consumer users (signed in with a Microsoft account), the key continues to open the Microsoft Copilot app.

## Copilot+ PC performance

Copilot+ PCs are powerful devices. In fact, the top performing Copilot+ PCs outperform the MacBook Air® M4™. See [aka.ms/cpclaims](https://aka.ms/cpclaims) for more details, including device-specific testing results.
