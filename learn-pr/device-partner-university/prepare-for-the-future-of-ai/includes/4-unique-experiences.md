Thanks to their powerful NPUs, Copilot+ PCs enable a number of unique AI experiences.

It’s important to note that many ISVs (independent software vendors) are also building applications and tools that will take advantage of the NPU—making tasks like video editing, deepfake detection, and threat analysis faster and more efficient than before.

Let's take a look at some of the exclusive NPU-powered features found in Copilot+ PCs. Check out [Microsoft's official site](https://www.microsoft.com/windows/copilot-plus-pcs) for more information on availability.

## Recall (preview)

Recall (preview) can help you find anything you remember seeing on your device. By using natural language, you can describe what you remember—and Recall will do the rest. It takes periodic snapshots of your screen and organizes them into a timeline. These snapshots are locally stored and never leave your PC. You can use Recall to search these snapshots by just describing what you're looking for.

New [privacy controls](https://support.microsoft.com/windows/privacy-and-control-over-your-recall-experience-d404f672-7647-41e5-886c-a3c59680af15) make Recall more secure than ever.

## Live Captions

On Copilot+ PCs, Live Captions offers real-time translation for video and audio from over 40 languages into English—removing boundaries for understanding and collaboration across languages. Live Captions can provide captions even when disconnected from the internet, and you have control over how the captions look.

## Windows Studio Effects

Windows Studio Effects offer a number of video and audio enhancements for video calls. These include creative filters, portrait light, eye contact teleprompter, portrait blur and voice focus—all designed to ensure everyone can make their best impression. While some of these effects are available on Windows 11 PCs with NPUs capable of under 40 TOPS, like Portrait Blur and Automatic Framing, you'll need a Copilot+ PC to take advantage of the entire set.

## Click to Do (preview)

Click to Do (preview) is a newer AI experience for Copilot+ PCs. By making text and images selectable, Click to Do provides relevant action suggestions that help you get things done faster. For example, you can use Click to Do to quickly summarize text on a screen with Copilot or edit an on-screen image. The analysis is always performed locally on the device, and ends when you exit Click to Do.

## Improved Windows search (preview)

On Copilot+ PCs, Improved Windows search is built into File Explorer, the taskbar’s Windows Search box, and Settings. You can find any local files and active OneDrive files using associated words and phrases—even if you don’t remember the file name. Improved Windows search also works for settings, so you can simply type what you want to do—like "turn on dark mode" or "add headphones" and it will offer you the correct setting. It even works offline thanks to the NPU!
