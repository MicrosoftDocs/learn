Contoso is a global financial services company with over 50,000 employees operating across multiple regions. The organization faces several challenges:

- High IT complexity: Managing updates and recovery for thousands of endpoints requires significant manual effort.
- Growing security risks: Increased phishing attempts and credential theft have raised concerns about identity protection and compliance.

To address these challenges, think about some of the features you learned about in this module:

- Cloud Rebuild – Rebuild devices remotely by downloading installation files from the cloud.
- Point-in-Time Restore – Roll back devices to a previous state quickly.
- Quick Machine Recovery – Speeds up remediation when devices fail to boot.
- Windows Hello for Business – Passwordless authentication using biometrics and passkeys.
- BitLocker encryption – Protects data at rest on devices.
- Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) – Future-proof encryption against quantum attacks.
- Windows Autopatch – Automates monthly security updates and quality patches.
- Windows Hotpatch – Applies updates without rebooting to reduce downtime.

## Real-world success story

[Banco do Brasil](https://www.microsoft.com/customers/story/24651-banco-do-brasil-windows-11/?msockid=04e7825cf65763aa120197b9f7736295#section-block-body) is one of the largest and most established financial institutions in the world, with more than 86,000 employees operating across thousands of service locations. The organization faced significant challenges in delivering a consistent and secure digital experience due to fragmented operating systems and complex IT environments.

- Devices running different operating systems created inconsistencies in security and management.
- Remote work during the pandemic highlighted the need for a standardized, secure hybrid environment.
- Increased security risks required stronger identity protection and compliance controls.

### Solutions

To address these challenges, Banco do Brasil:

- Migrated more than 30,000 devices to **Windows 11 Enterprise** to standardize the operating environment.
- Implemented **Windows Hello for Business** for passwordless authentication using facial and fingerprint biometrics.
- Enabled **BitLocker encryption** and **Microsoft Defender for Endpoint** for advanced device security.
- Adopted **Microsoft Intune** and **Windows Autopilot** for centralized device management and automated provisioning.
- Integrated **Microsoft Entra ID** for identity-based security, including multifactor authentication (MFA) and Conditional Access.

### Outcomes

As a result, they experienced:

- Improved security posture with advanced encryption and identity protection.
- Reduced IT complexity through cloud-based management and automated provisioning.
- Enhanced collaboration with a consistent user experience, resulting in a 117% increase in daily Microsoft Teams message exchanges.

Banco do Brasil’s approach demonstrates how combining identity security (Windows Hello for Business), device protection (BitLocker), and modern management tools (Intune, Autopatch) can create a secure, standardized environment for a global workforce.
