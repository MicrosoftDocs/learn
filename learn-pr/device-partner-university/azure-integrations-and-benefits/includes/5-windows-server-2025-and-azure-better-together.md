Windows Server 2025 is designed to work seamlessly with Azure management tools, helping organizations improve uptime, streamline operations, and unlock advanced hybrid capabilities. By connecting Windows Server to Azure, IT teams gain access to features that simplify management and reduce disruption. For more, see [Windows Server and Azure Management](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows-server/administration/azure).

Some of the key benefits include:

- **[Hotpatching](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows-server/get-started/hotpatch)**: Install updates without frequent reboots, cutting downtime from up to 12 reboots annually to as few as 4.
- **At-scale inventory**: Search and manage all servers and resources from a single portal.
- **Consistent VM extensions**: Enforce best practices across environments for reliable operations.
- **Integration with premium services**: Connect hybrid servers to advanced management capabilities.

> [!TIP]
> **Troubleshooting**
> If Hotpatching fails to apply, check:
> - Whether the server is connected to Azure Arc.
> - That the server is running a supported version of Windows Server.
> - That the required subscription is active.

## High-performance and resilience with Azure

Windows Server 2025 gains additional advantages in Azure, such as:
- **AI and HPC support**: Up to 832 CPU threads and 24TB RAM for demanding workloads.
- **Scalable storage**: Millions of IOPS with low latency and high throughput.
- **Resilience**: Real-time failover and cloud-based backup for business continuity.
 
With hybrid environments in place, securing them becomes critical. Let’s explore how Azure Arc helps enforce consistent security and compliance across your infrastructure.

## Security and compliance

Azure Arc helps apply Azure’s security measures to Windows Server, ensuring consistent protection and compliance. Key capabilities include:

- Applying security baselines across servers
- Enforcing role-based access controls [Azure RBAC](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/overview)
- Maintaining compliance with regulatory standards across on-premises and hybrid environments

### Scenario: Healthcare Compliance

A healthcare provider must meet HIPAA requirements across multiple data centers. By applying Azure Policy and RBAC through Azure Arc, they ensure consistent security configurations and access controls—without manual audits.

Use Azure Monitor to track patch status and alerts. 

You’ve now seen how Windows Server 2025 and Azure combine to deliver a robust, secure, and scalable hybrid solution. Let’s recap the key takeaways from this module.
