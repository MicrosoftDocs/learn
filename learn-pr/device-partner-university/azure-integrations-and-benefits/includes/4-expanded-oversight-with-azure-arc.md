## Unified management of servers

[Azure Arc-enabled Windows Servers](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-arc/servers/overview) allow IT teams to manage both virtual machines and physical servers from a single platform. This streamlines operations and reduces the complexity of maintaining multiple environments.

## Multi-OS monitoring

Organizations can monitor and manage servers running both Windows and Linux operating systems, giving a complete view of the infrastructure and enabling more informed decisions.

## Strategic insights and control

By using Azure Arc insights, IT teams can make data-driven decisions that align with business objectives. Centralized management provides visibility and control across on-premises, Azure, and other cloud environments, improving security and compliance.

## Securing hybrid Windows Server environments

Azure Arc-enabled Windows Server integrates with Azure’s built-in security and compliance tools:

- **[Azure Policy](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/governance/policy/overview)**: Enforce compliance at scale across all registered servers.
- **Security baselines**: Apply consistent configurations to reduce vulnerabilities.
- **[Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC)](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/overview)**: Limit access to sensitive resources.
- **Cross-environment compliance**: Monitor and ensure compliance with regulations across on-premises and cloud deployments.
 
## Security integration

Azure Arc also connects Windows Server environments to Azure’s built-in security and compliance tools, such as Azure Policy and role-based access control (RBAC).  
We’ll dive deeper into these capabilities in the **Security and compliance** unit later in this module.

Operational efficiency is equally critical—especially for organizations running mission-critical workloads. Let’s explore how Windows Server 2025 and Azure work together to keep systems running smoothly.
