Windows Server 2025 is designed to integrate with Azure, giving you flexibility to manage workloads on-premises, in Azure, or across multiple clouds. Azure Arc extends these capabilities by enabling a single management experience for all your servers and applications, regardless of where they run.

Imagine your IT team manages servers in three different environments—on-premises, a private data center, and another cloud provider. Without Azure Arc, each environment requires its own tools. With Azure Arc, you can centralize management through the Azure Portal for consistent operations. See [Windows Server Management](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-arc/servers/windows-server-management-overview) for an overview of Azure Arc-enabled Windows Server capabilities.

## What is Microsoft Azure?

Microsoft Azure is a cloud platform that provides infrastructure, services, and management tools. Azure supports:
- On-demand scalability.
- Enterprise-grade security and compliance.
- Flexible compute, storage, and networking.
- A wide ecosystem of services such as databases, AI, and monitoring.

Suppose your organization is expanding to a new region. Instead of investing in new hardware, you can spin up Azure resources instantly and scale them as demand grows—paying only for what you use.

## Azure services for Windows Server

Several Azure services enhance Windows Server 2025 deployments:

- **[Azure VMware Solution](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-vmware/introduction)**: Enables you to migrate and run VMware workloads natively in Azure.
- **[Azure Hybrid Benefit](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/get-started/azure-hybrid-benefit)**: Allows your organization to use existing Windows Server licenses to save on costs when moving workloads to the cloud.
- **[Microsoft Defender for Cloud](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/defender-for-cloud-introduction)**: Strengthens hybrid environments by detecting and responding to threats.
- **[Microsoft Sentinel](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sentinel/overview?tabs=defender-portal)**: A cloud-native SIEM that monitors Windows Server environments for security threats across hybrid infrastructures.
 
Now that you understand how Windows Server 2025 is built for hybrid flexibility, let’s take a closer look at the cloud platform that powers these capabilities—Microsoft Azure. Understanding Azure’s core services will help you see how they complement and extend Windows Server functionality.
