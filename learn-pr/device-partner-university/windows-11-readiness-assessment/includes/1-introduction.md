Windows 10 has reached end of support (EOS), which means it no longer receives security updates, patches, or technical assistance from Microsoft. For IT professionals, this milestone introduces a critical responsibility—ensuring that every device in the organization is ready for Windows 11.

Imagine you're an IT administrator preparing for this transition. Some of your organization’s devices are standalone systems that aren’t managed through any centralized tool. Others are part of a managed environment using Microsoft Intune. Leadership has tasked you with evaluating which systems can upgrade to Windows 11, which require hardware replacement, and how to minimize disruption during the process.

In this module, you learn how to perform a Windows 11 device readiness assessment using Microsoft’s available tools for both managed and unmanaged devices. You start by checking device eligibility with the PC Health Check app for noncentrally managed endpoints, then move on to reviewing readiness data through Endpoint Analytics in Microsoft Intune for managed environments.

By the end of this module, you're able to confidently assess hardware readiness and prepare your organization for a secure, efficient migration to Windows 11.

## Learning objectives

By the end of this module, you're able to:

- Assess Windows 11 readiness for unmanaged devices using PC Health Check.  
- Evaluate managed devices using Endpoint Analytics in Microsoft Intune.  
- Interpret readiness results to determine which devices require upgrades or replacements.  
- Document findings to support planning and deployment decisions.
