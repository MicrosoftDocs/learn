Now that support has ended for Windows 10, organizations must ensure every device in their environment is secure, compliant, and prepared for the future. Without a clear readiness process, IT teams can struggle to determine which systems meet Windows 11 requirements, which need upgrades, and how to plan replacements efficiently. These challenges can lead to increased vulnerability, inconsistent device performance, and unnecessary disruption for end users.

In this module, you explored how Microsoft tools simplify that transition. You used the **PC Health Check** app to evaluate unmanaged devices and identify which systems are ready for Windows 11. You also used **Endpoint Analytics** in Microsoft Intune to assess managed devices at scale, analyze readiness results, and uncover potential hardware blockers. Together, these approaches provide a complete readiness framework—helping IT professionals move from uncertainty to confidence as they guide their organizations through the post–Windows 10 era.

Without these assessment tools, upgrade planning often depends on manual checks, incomplete inventories, or assumptions that can delay progress. By using Microsoft’s built-in solutions, IT professionals can streamline evaluations, reduce risk, and make data-driven upgrade decisions. These skills not only simplify the transition to Windows 11 but also establish a repeatable process for ongoing device lifecycle management—ensuring every system remains secure, productive, and ready for what’s next.
