With your web app running in Azure and connected with VSTS, now let's try the whole CI/CD pipeline. After you make a change in Visual Studio and commit your code, a build is triggered which then triggers a release to Azure.

In this tutorial, you will:
    - Update app in Visual Studio and commit changes
    - Review build process and updated running app

At the end of the tutorial, you can check your knowledge with a quiz challenge.
