## Overview of VSTS build defintions and CI/CD pipelines

The starting point for configuring CI and CD for your applications is to have your source code in a version control system. VSTS supports two forms of version control - *Git* and *Team Foundation Version Control*. The *Build* service integrates with both of these version control systems. Once you have configured CI, any changes you push to your version control repository will be automatically built and validated. You can also manage your source code in Subversion, Bitbucket, GitHub, or any other Git repository. The Build service integrates with all of these version control systems.

To configure CI, you create a build definition. A build definition is a representation of the automation process that you want to run to build and test your application. The automation process is defined as a collection of tasks. VSTS has a number of tasks to build and test your application. For example, tasks exist to build .Net, Java, Node, Android, Xcode, and C++ applications. Similarly, there are tasks to run tests using a number of testing frameworks and services. You can also run command line, PowerShell, or Shell scripts in your automation.
