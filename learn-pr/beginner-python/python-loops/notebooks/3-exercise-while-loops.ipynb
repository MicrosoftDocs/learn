    "# Using `while` loops in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, `while` loops let you run code an unknown number of times. The loops examine a Boolean condition and, as long as the condition is true, the code inside the loop will run. This is very useful for situations like prompting a user for values.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you're creating an application that prompts a user to enter a list of planets. In a later exercise, you'll add code that displays the list. For now, though, you'll create only the code that prompts the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "Start by adding two variables, one for the input from the user, named `new_planet`, and another variable for the list of planets, named `planets`."

    "Inside the loop, you'll check to see whether the `new_planet` variable contains a value, which should be the name of a planet. This is a quick way to see whether the user has entered a value. If they have, your code will `append` that value to the `planets` variable.\n",
