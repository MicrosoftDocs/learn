By using test expressions, otherwise known as Boolean expressions, you can conditionally run Python code. They are commonly used in Python to "make decisions" about what should happen next while a program is running. In the earlier units, you wrote test expressions as part of `if`, `else`, and `elif` statements, and you further fine-tuned your conditions by using the operators `and` and `or`.

Boolean expressions and statements are a key part of creating complex Python programs, where you want your code to run only under certain conditions.

Here are some of the essentials you now know about conditional logic:

- Booleans can have one of two values, `True` or `False`.
- `if`, `else`, and `elif` statements can be used to run code under specific conditions.
- `and` and `or` operators can be used to combine test expressions and create more complex conditions.

With these tools, you should feel ready to write more complex code blocks in Python.
