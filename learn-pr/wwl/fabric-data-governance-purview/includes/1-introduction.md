Microsoft Fabric is an end-to-end, analytics, and data platform that provides a unified solution for data storage, movement, transformation, processing, real-time event routing, and reporting. When working with a large volume of data in Fabric, some of which is highly sensitive, you must ensure that it's accurate, trustworthy, and protected throughout the data lifecycle. Data governance is the set of techniques and tools that you use to implement these requirements.
