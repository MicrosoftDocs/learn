quiz:
  questions:
  - content: What is a key advantage of using the Import mode in a scalable semantic model?
    choices:
    - content: It supports many-to-many relationships without the need for bridge tables.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. This is a feature of Composite model, not Import mode.
    - content: It allows querying data directly from the source without storing it in Power BI.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. This is a feature of DirectQuery mode, not Import mode.
    - content: It offers the most flexibility and fastest performance but requires periodic refreshes to keep the data current.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. Import mode involves importing and storing data within Power BI, offering the most flexibility and fastest performance.
  - content: What is the purpose of iterator functions in DAX?
    choices:
    - content: To store the result of an expression and reuse it multiple times
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. This describes the purpose of variables in DAX, not iterator functions.
    - content: To perform row-by-row calculations over a table and return a single value
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. Iterator functions in DAX, such as SUMX, AVERAGEX, and MAXX, perform row-by-row calculations over a table and return a single value.
    - content: To perform checks and return information about the data
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. This describes the purpose of information functions in DAX, not iterator functions.
  - content: What is the primary benefit of using calculation groups in a semantic model?
    choices:
    - content: They enable users to select different fields or measures dynamically.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. This functionality is provided by field parameters, not calculation groups.
    - content: They allow for reusable calculations that apply across multiple measures, reducing redundancy and simplifying maintenance.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. Calculation groups streamline complex calculations like time intelligence functions across the entire model.
    - content: They allow for dynamic formatting based on certain conditions.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. Dynamic formatting is achieved through dynamic format strings, not calculation groups.
