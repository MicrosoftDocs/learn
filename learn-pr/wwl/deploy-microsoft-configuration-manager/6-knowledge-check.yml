  - content: "Contoso wants to run Windows setup to complete an in-place upgrade from Windows 8.1 to Windows 11. What's the recommended approach for large-scale deployments such as Contoso that have hundreds of devices to upgrade?"
    choices:
    - content: "Run the Windows setup manually with an unattended file"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Running setup manually is not a scalable solution, even when using an unattended file. Try again."
    - content: "Build a task sequence"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Running setup manually is not a scalable solution, even when using an unattended file. Building a task sequence is the recommended approach for large-scale deployments."
