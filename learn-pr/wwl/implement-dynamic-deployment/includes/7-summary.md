Administrators can use dynamic deployment methods to configure Windows 10 and later clients. Subscription Activation can be used to change the edition of a Windows client, without the need to reinstall the operating system. Provisioning packages can be used to apply a desired configuration, including apps, to a device using removable media or a downloaded file. When a device joins Azure AD, configuration policies can automatically be applied. For user-owned devices, after enrollment, users can agree to policies that can be applied to ensure organizational compliance.
