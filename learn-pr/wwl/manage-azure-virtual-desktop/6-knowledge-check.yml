  - content: "A system administrator is tasked with setting up a Windows 11 Enterprise desktop in Azure Virtual Desktop. They have created a personal host pool, a session host virtual machine, a workspace, and an application group. What should they do next to ensure users can access the desktop?"
    choices:
    - content: "They should assign users to the application group."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. After setting up the host pool, session host VM, workspace, and application group, the next step is to assign users to the application group."
    - content: "They should create another session host virtual machine."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Creating another session host virtual machine isn't required unless more resources are needed."
    - content: "They should delete and recreate the host pool."
