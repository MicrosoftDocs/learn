  - content: "A system administrator is tasked with setting up a Windows 11 Enterprise desktop in Azure Virtual Desktop. They have created a personal host pool, a session host virtual machine, a workspace, and an application group. What should they do next to ensure users can access the desktop?"
    choices:
    - content: "They should assign users to the application group."
