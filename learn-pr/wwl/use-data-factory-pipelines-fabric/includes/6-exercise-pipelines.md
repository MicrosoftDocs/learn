Now it's your chance to implement a pipeline in Microsoft Fabric. In this exercise, you create a pipeline that copies data from an external source into a lakehouse. Then enhance the pipeline by adding activities to transform the ingested data.

> [!NOTE]
> You need a Microsoft Fabric trial license with the Fabric preview enabled in your tenant. See [**Getting started with Fabric**](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/get-started/fabric-trial) to enable your Fabric trial license.

Launch the exercise and follow the instructions.
