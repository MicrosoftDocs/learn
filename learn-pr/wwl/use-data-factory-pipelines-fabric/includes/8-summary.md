With Microsoft Fabric, you can create pipelines that encapsulate complex data ingestion and transformation processes. Pipelines provide an effective way to orchestrate data processing tasks that can be run on-demand or at scheduled intervals.

> [!TIP]
> For more information about pipelines in Microsoft Fabric, see [Data pipelines](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/data-factory/data-factory-overview) in the Microsoft Fabric documentation.
