As a Fabric admin, part of your role is to manage security for the Fabric environment, including managing users and groups, and how users share and distribute content in Fabric.

## Manage users: assign and manage licenses

**User licenses** control the level of user access and functionality within the Fabric environment. Administrators ensure licensed users have the access they need to data and analytics to do their jobs effectively. They also limit access to sensitive data and ensure compliance with data protection laws and regulations.

Managing licenses allows administrators to monitor and control costs by ensuring that licenses are allocated efficiently and only to users who need them. This can help to prevent unnecessary expenses and ensure that the organization is utilizing its resources effectively.

Having the appropriate procedures in place to assign and manage licenses helps to control access to data and analytics, ensure compliance with regulations, and optimize costs.

License management for Fabric is handled in the Microsoft 365 admin center. For more information about managing licenses, see [Assign licenses to users](/microsoft-365/admin/manage/assign-licenses-to-users?view=o365-worldwide&preserve-view=true).

> [!NOTE]
> The *license type* in workspace settings is related to the user licenses listed here. Users can see reports depending on the user license and the workspace license. For detailed information, see the [Microsoft Fabric licenses](/fabric/enterprise/licenses#workspace) documentation.

## Manage items and sharing

As an admin, you can manage how users share and distribute content. You can manage how users share content with others, and how they distribute content to others. You can also manage how users interact with items, such as data warehouses, data pipelines, datasets, reports, and dashboards.

Items in workspaces are best distributed through a workspace app or the workspace directly. Granting the least permissive rights is the first step in securing the data. Share the read only app for access to the reports or grant access to the workspaces for collaboration and development. Another aspect of managing and distributing items is enforcing these types of best practices.

You can manage sharing and distribution both internally and outside of your organization, in compliance with your organization's policies and procedures.
