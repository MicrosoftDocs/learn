      explanation: "Correct. Delta Lake provides a relational storage layer in which you can create tables based on Parquet files in a data lake."
    - content: "A synchronization solution that replicates data between SQL Server and SPark."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Delta Lake does not replicate data between SQL Server and Spark."
  - content: "You've loaded a Spark dataframe with data, that you now want to use in a delta table. What format should you use to write the dataframe to storage?"
    choices:

    - content: "The table definition is removed from the metastore, but the data files remain intact."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The life-cycle of the metadata and data for a managed table are the same."
