    - content: "A relational storage layer for Spark that supports tables based on Parquet files."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Delta Lake provides a relational storage layer in which you can create tables based on Parquet files in a data lake."
    - content: "A synchronization solution that replicates data between SQL Server and SPark."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Delta Lake does not replicate data between SQL Server and Spark."
  - content: "You've loaded a Spark dataframe with data, that you now want to use in a delta table. What format should you use to write the dataframe to storage?"
    choices:
    - content: "CSV"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Delta Lake does not support tables based on CSV files."
    - content: "PARQUET"

      explanation: "Incorrect. Although Delta Lake tables are based on Parquet files, the format must also include a transaction log."
    - content: "DELTA"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Storing a dataframe in DELTA format creates parquet files for the data and the transaction log metadata necessary for Delta Lake tables."
  - content: "You have a managed table based on a folder that contains data files in delta format. If you drop the table, what happens?"
    choices:
    - content: "The table metadata and data files are deleted."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The life-cycle of the metadata and data for a managed table are the same."
    - content: "The table definition is removed from the metastore, but the data files remain intact."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The life-cycle of the metadata and data for a managed table are the same."
    - content: "The table definition remains in the metastore, but the data files are deleted."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The life-cycle of the metadata and data for a managed table are the same."
