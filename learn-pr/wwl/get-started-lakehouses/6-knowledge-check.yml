  questions:
  - content: "What is a Microsoft Fabric lakehouse?"
    choices:
    - content: "A relational database based on the Microsoft SQL Server database engine."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Lakehouses aren't based on SQL Server."
    - content: "A hierarchy of folders and files in Azure Data Lake Store Gen2."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Lakehouses aren't folders in Azure Data Lake Store Gen2."
    - content: "An analytical store that combines the file storage flexibility of a data lake with the SQL-based query capabilities of a data warehouse."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Lakehouses combine data lake and data warehouse features."
  - content: "You want to include data in an external Azure Data Lake Store Gen2 location in your lakehouse, without the requirement to copy the data. What should you do?"
    choices:
    - content: "Create a Data pipeline that uses a Copy Data activity to load the external data into a file."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A Copy Data activity in a pipeline copies the data."
    - content: "Create a shortcut."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. A shortcut enables you to include external data in the lakehouse."
    - content: "Create a Dataflow (Gen2) that extracts the data and loads it into a table."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A dataflow that loads the data into a table would copy the data."
  - content: "You want to use Apache Spark to interactively explore data in a file in the lakehouse. What should you do?"
    choices:
    - content: "Create a notebook."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. A notebook enables interactive Spark coding."
    - content: "Switch to the SQL analytics endpoint mode."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The SQL analytics endpoint mode doesn't support interactive Spark code."
    - content: "Create a Dataflow (Gen2)."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A dataflow doesn't provide an interactive Spark coding interface."
