## Minimum requirements

### Subscription

In order to purchase security compute units, you need to have an Azure subscription. For more information, see [Create your Azure free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free).

### Security compute units

Security compute units are the required units of resources that are needed for dependable and consistent performance of Microsoft Security Copilot.  

Security Copilot is sold in a provisioned capacity model and is billed by the hour. You can provision Security Compute Units (SCUs) and increase or decrease them at any time. Billing is calculated on an hourly basis with a minimum of one hour. 

For more information, see [Microsoft Security Copilot pricing](https://aka.ms/CopilotforSecurity_Pricing).
 
### Capacity

Capacity in the context of Security Copilot, is an Azure resource that contains SCUs. SCUs are provisioned for Security Copilot. You can easily manage capacity by increasing or decreasing provisioned SCUs within the Azure portal or the Security Copilot portal. Security Copilot provides a usage monitoring dashboard for Copilot owners, allowing them to track usage over time and make informed decisions about capacity provisioning. 

## Onboarding to Security Copilot

Onboarding to Security Copilot is a two-step process:

- [Step 1: Provision capacity](#step-1-provision-capacity)
- [Step 2: Set up default environment](#step-2-set-up-default-environment)

### Step 1: Provision capacity

You can choose from the following options to provision capacity:

- [Option 1 (Recommended): Provision capacity within Security Copilot](#option-1-recommended-provision-capacity-through-copilot-for-security)
- [Option 2: Provision capacity through Azure](#option-2-provision-capacity-in-azure)


>[!NOTE]
>Regardless of the method you choose, you will need to purchase a minimum of 1 and a maximum of 100 SCUs. The recommended number of units to start *the most basic exploration* of Security Copilot is 3 units.


#### Option 1 (Recommended): Provision capacity through Security Copilot

When you first open Security Copilot (https://securitycopilot.microsoft.com), you're guided through the steps in setting up capacity for your organization.

**Required role**

You need to be an Azure subscription owner or contributor to create capacity.

> [!NOTE]
> A global administrator in Microsoft Entra ID doesn't necessarily have the Azure subscription owner or contributor role by default. Microsoft Entra role assignments don't grant access to Azure resources. As a global admin in Entra, you can enable acccess management for Azure resources through Azure portal.
1. Sign in to Security Copilot (https://securitycopilot.microsoft.com). 

2. Select **Get started**.

3. Set up your security capacity: 
   Select the Azure subscription, associate capacity to a resource group, add a name to the capacity, select the prompt evaluation location, and specify the number of Security Compute Units (SCUs). Data is always stored in your home tenant geo.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/set-up-capacity.png" alt-text="Screenshot of set up your security capacity." lightbox="../media/set-up-capacity.png":::

    > [!NOTE]
    > The number of SCUs is provisioned on an hourly basis, and the estimated monthly cost is displayed.
    >
    > If your selected geo location is too busy, you can also evaluate the prompts anywhere in the world. This can be done by selecting the appropriate option in the capacity creation screen.

4. Confirm that you acknowledge and agree to the terms and conditions, then select **Continue**.

After you've created the capacity, it will take a few minutes to deploy the Azure resource on the backend.
