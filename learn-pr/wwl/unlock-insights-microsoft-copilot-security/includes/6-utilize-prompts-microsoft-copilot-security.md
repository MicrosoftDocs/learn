## Prompting in Microsoft Security Copilot

### Overview

Microsoft Security Copilot enhances your security operations by using prompts to generate responses tailored to your security needs. Prompts are text-based inputs that guide Security Copilot to deliver valuable insights and actions.

### How to Use Prompts

#### Selecting the prompts icon

1. **Access the Prompt Bar:** On the Copilot home page, select the sparkle icon located at the prompt bar.
2. **Explore Promptbooks:** You'll find a list of promptbooks and individual prompts. Promptbooks are collections of prompts designed to accomplish specific security tasks in sequence.

#### Creating your own prompts

1. **Enter Your Request:** Type your question or request in the prompt bar.
2. **Submit the Prompt:** Select Send or press Enter.
3. **View the Response:** Security Copilot will process your prompt and display the response. You can monitor the steps taken in the process log, which shows the actions and information sources used.

You can cancel, edit, or delete your prompt at any time during the response generation. Review the response to ensure it meets your needs. If necessary, continue the session with more prompts for iterative responses. Adjust your prompts by providing more details or specifying the response format to improve accuracy.

#### Effective Prompt elements

To create effective prompts, include:
- **Goal:** Clearly define the specific information or action you need.
- **Context:** Explain why you need the information or how you'll use it.
- **Expectations:** Indicate the preferred format or target audience.
- **Source:** Specify known data sources or plugins to use.

**Example Prompts:**
- Basic: "Summarize incident 15134."
- Improved: "Summarize incident 15134 in Microsoft Defender XDR into a paragraph that I can submit to my manager and create a list of entities involved."

#### Providing feedback

Your feedback helps improve Security Copilot. Use the feedback buttons at the bottom of each response:
- **Looks Right:** If satisfied, specify what was accurate.
- **Needs Improvement:** If not satisfied, provide details on what was lacking.
- **Inappropriate:** Report any concerning or unexpected responses.
