  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "As an IT administrator, you're considering using Windows Autopilot's \"Self-Deploying\" mode for deploying new devices in your organization. Which of the following is a benefit of this mode?"
    choices:
    - content: "It allows a device to be fully configured for company use, reducing the time IT must spend on deploying new devices."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The \"Self-Deploying\" mode in Windows Autopilot enables a device to be fully configured for company use, reducing the time IT must spend on deploying new devices."
    - content: "It requires manual entry of user credentials during device setup."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. In \"Self-Deploying\" mode, devices are configured automatically and do not require user credentials during setup. Try again."
    - content: "It requires IT personnel to manually register each device."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The \"Self-Deploying\" mode doesn't require IT personnel to manually register each device. Try again."
    - content: "It increases the need for physical IT support during deployment."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The \"Self-Deploying\" mode reduces the need for physical IT support during deployment. Try again."
  - content: "You're preparing for an Autopilot deployment in your organization and need to gather device hardware IDs. Which method can you use to obtain these IDs?"
    choices:
    - content: "Using a third-party software inventory tool."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While third-party tools might be able to provide this information, they are not the recommended method for gathering device hardware IDs for Autopilot deployment. Try again."
    - content: "Manually checking each device's system information."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Manually checking each device's system information is not a scalable or efficient method for gathering device hardware IDs for Autopilot deployment. Try again."
    - content: "Using the Windows Autopilot hardware ID script."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. You can use the Windows Autopilot hardware ID script (Get-WindowsAutoPilotInfo.ps1) to gather device hardware IDs for Autopilot deployment."
    - content: "Requesting the information from the device manufacturer."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While some manufacturers can provide this information for new devices, it's not a reliable method for all devices, especially existing ones in your organization. Try again."
  - content: "You're troubleshooting a failed Windows Autopilot deployment. Which of the following steps would be most helpful in identifying the root cause of the failure?"
    choices:
    - content: "Reboot the device and attempt the deployment again."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While rebooting the device may solve some issues, it's not the most helpful step in identifying the root cause of a deployment failure. Try again."
    - content: "Check the Event Viewer for errors related to device enrollment."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The Event Viewer can provide detailed error messages related to device enrollment, which can be crucial in identifying the root cause of a deployment failure."
    - content: "Reinstall the operating system on the device."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While this may ultimately be necessary in some cases, it's a drastic step and won't help identify the root cause of the deployment failure. Try again."
    - content: "Physically inspect the device for hardware issues."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Hardware issues are unlikely to be the root cause of a Windows Autopilot deployment failure. Try again."
