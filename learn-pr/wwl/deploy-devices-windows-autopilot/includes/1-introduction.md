Traditionally, the process of deploying a new device begins with wiping the device with whatever operating system was pre-installed and deploying one of the organization’s images to the device. However when admins are purchasing a device from an OEM, Windows 11 is already the OS on the device. While simply using the OEM image isn’t practical, Windows 10 introduced a new process called Windows Autopilot. Autopilot is designed to achieve the desired outcome of deploying a new hardware or refreshing an existing hardware with the organization’s desired configuration, without the process of creating, managing, and pushing large images over the network.
