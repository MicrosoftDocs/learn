Windows 10 introduced a new OS deployment method called Windows Autopilot. Windows Autopilot reconfigures the existing operating system to a desired configuration. This feature significantly reduces the overhead involved with managing and deploying large images to clients. Instead of creating or configuring an image, Administrators configure a deployment profile with the intended configuration settings. Windows Autopilot offers different deployment modes that provide flexibility such as a user-driven experience or automated approach. This method can be used on new or existing Windows 11 clients. The Autopilot for Existing Devices feature provides a method for upgrading from Windows 8.1 devices.
