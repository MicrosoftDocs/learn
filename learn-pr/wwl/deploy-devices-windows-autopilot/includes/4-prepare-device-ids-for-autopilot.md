After you meet all the prerequisites, you can set up Windows Autopilot deployment. The setup process includes:

 -  Obtaining the hardware IDs of the devices that you want to deploy to the cloud service.
 -  Uploading the hardware IDs
 -  Creating a Windows Autopilot deployment profile.
 -  Applying the Windows Autopilot deployment profile to the devices or device groups.

### Manage Windows Autopilot in Intune

If you want to manage Windows Autopilot in Microsoft Intune, you must configure automatic mobile device management (MDM) enrollment for Microsoft Entra ID-joined Windows 11 devices. You can configure automatic MDM enrollment by performing the following steps:

1. In the Microsoft Entra admin center, select **Microsoft Entra ID**.
2. On the Microsoft Entra ID blade, select **Mobility (MDM and MAM)**, and then in the details pane, select **Microsoft Intune**.
3. On the Microsoft Intune blade, under **MDM user scope**, select **All** if you want all users to be able to enroll their devices in mobile device management. If you want only certain users to be able to enroll their devices, select **Some**, specify the groups whose members should be able to enroll, and then select **Save**.

As discussed earlier, you can create Windows Autopilot deployment profiles in the Microsoft Intune admin center.


### Prepare a Microsoft Autopilot deployment

You can manage Windows Autopilot deployment by using:

 -  Intune
 -  Microsoft Store for Business

> [!NOTE]
> Microsoft Store for Business is a cloud service that organizations of any size can use. Organizations use it to distribute both modern Windows apps that vendors develop for a general audience and line-of-business (LOB) apps that are available only for the organization*.*

You must perform the first step—uploading device-specific information, including hardware IDs—in Microsoft Store for Business or Microsoft Intune. If you plan to manage Windows Autopilot in Intune, you’ll have to sync Windows Autopilot devices from Microsoft Store for Business to Intune.

To deploy devices by using Windows Autopilot, you must first obtain the CSV file that contains the device-specific information.

### Get the CSV file from your OEM partner

If your OEM partner supports Windows Autopilot, you can obtain a CSV file from them when you purchase the devices. You can also generate a device-specific CSV file yourself, based on the device inventory. The CSV file should have the following three columns:

 -  Device Serial Number
 -  Windows Product ID
 -  Hardware Hash

### Generate your own CSV file

If the OEM partner doesn't provide a CSV file, you can generate a device-specific file by obtaining and running the Get-WindowsAutopilotInfo.ps1 Windows PowerShell script. You can install the script by running the following cmdlet:

`Install-Script -Name Get-WindowsAutopilotInfo`

After installing the script, you can generate device-specific information and save it to the D:\\Devices\\Device1.csv file by running the following cmdlet:

`Get-WindowsAutopilotInfo.ps1 –OutputFile D:\\Devices\\Device1.csv`

### Upload the device-specific CSV file

To do this, you must have the Admin role in Microsoft Store for Business or Global admin role in Intune. When you upload a CSV file, you'll receive a notification if the upload was successful and the number of devices that were added. If there was any error, for example, if the CSV file wasn't formatted properly or some devices were already in Microsoft Store for Business, you can download the CSV file with error information and URLs that point to detailed error descriptions, and then you can review the details.

When you upload a CSV file, you can add devices to an existing Windows Autopilot deployment group, create a new Windows Autopilot deployment group for the devices, or add them without using groups. You can use groups when you want to apply the same deployment settings to multiple devices at once.

To complete this process using Intune, use the following procedure:

1.  In Microsoft Intune admin center, navigate to **Devices** > **Enroll Devices** > **Devices**. Select **Import**.
2.  Browse and locate your CSV file.
3.  Import the file.
4.  After import is complete, select **Device enrollment**, select **Windows enrollment**, select **Windows Autopilot**, select **Devices** and then select **Sync**.
5.  Refresh the view to see the new devices.

### Import a device hash directly into Intune

In certain circumstances, it might be beneficial to directly import the device hash into Microsoft Intune rather than generating the file as shown above. This is often useful in testing scenarios or perhaps could be useful if you have a batch of machines that are being built by onsite technicians ready for users.

The following example imports the device directly into Intune along with assigning a Dynamic variable tag (Autopilot-Devices) to an Azure AD group to ensure the device ends up in a specific group:

Open a PowerShell prompt on the Autopilot device at the 'Welcome screen':

```powershell
Install-Script -Name Get-WindowsAutopilotInfo
```

```powershell
Get-WindowsAutoPilotInfo.ps1 -online -GroupTag "Autopilot-Devices" -Assign
```
