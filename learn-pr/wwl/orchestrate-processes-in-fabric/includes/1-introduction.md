This module covers various articles that provide an overview of some of the data orchestration and data movement technologies within Microsoft Fabric. It provides an overview of the scheduling and event-based triggering capabilities, which can help data engineers design pro-active systems to support the rapidly changing data needs of business.

## Pipelines in Microsoft Fabric

Data Factory provides a modern data integration experience to ingest, prepare, and transform data from various sources like databases, data warehouses, Lakehouse, and real-time data. It supports both citizen and professional developers with intelligent transformations and a rich set of activities. Users can create pipelines to execute multiple activities, access data sources through linked services, and add triggers to automate processes. Data Factory in Microsoft Fabric introduces Fast Copy capabilities for rapid data movement between data stores, enabling efficient data transfer to Lakehouse and Data Warehouse for analytics.

## Notebooks in Microsoft Fabric

Notebooks in Microsoft Fabric offer a versatile environment for data exploration, transformation, and analysis. They support various programming languages, including Python, KQL, and SQL, and provide an interactive interface for running code, visualizing data, and documenting workflows. Key features include:

## Schedules and Triggers in Microsoft Fabric

Scheduling pipelines includes three standard types of scheduling, including time-based, event-based, and custom scheduling. Scheduling in Microsoft Fabric also allows for seamless integration with other services, which allow for more dynamic event-driven pipelines.
