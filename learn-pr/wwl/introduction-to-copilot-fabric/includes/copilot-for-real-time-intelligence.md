Copilot for Real-Time Intelligence in Microsoft Fabric is an AI-based assistant that supports analysis of real-time data streams. It uses generative AI to help with complex queries and provide query suggestions and summaries.

## Key concepts

Copilot for Real-Time Intelligence can assist with the following tasks.

- **Natural language to query**: Copilot allows you to interact with real-time data using natural language. For example, you can ask Copilot to "Show the top-performing regions in the last hour," and it generates the necessary KQL (Kusto Query Language) query to retrieve the data.

- **Conversational interactions**: Copilot supports conversational interactions, which allows you to clarify, adapt, and extend your queries dynamically, all while maintaining the context of your previous inputs. You can refine the initial KQL generated by Copilot, or ask follow-up questions to explore the data further.

Here's an example of how you can interact with Copilot in the Fabric KQL queryset editor:
