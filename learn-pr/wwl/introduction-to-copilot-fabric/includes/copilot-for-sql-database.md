Copilot for SQL Database in Microsoft Fabric is an AI-based assistant that supports database management and query development. It uses generative AI to assist with query creation, debugging, and optimization.

### Key concepts

Copilot for SQL Database addresses common challenges users face when working with SQL. For example, many people struggle to translate business questions into accurate SQL queries. With **Natural language to SQL**, you can describe what you need—such as "List all customers who made purchases last month"—and Copilot will generate a query, reducing the need to memorize syntax.

Writing efficient queries can be time-consuming, especially when you're unsure of the table or column names. **Code completion** suggests relevant code snippets as you type. If you encounter issues or are unsure why a query isn't working, **Quick actions** can attempt to fix errors or explain the logic behind queries.

Understanding the structure of a database is another common hurdle. Copilot’s **Schema awareness** uses database metadata to offer context-aware suggestions. When errors occur, **Error handling and debugging** features provide recommendations to resolve issues and optimize performance.

Finally, complex queries can be difficult to interpret, especially for those new to SQL. With **Query explanation**, Copilot translates SQL logic into plain language, making it easier to understand what queries are doing and helping reinforce best practices.

Here's an example of how you can interact with Copilot in the Fabric SQL Database editor:
