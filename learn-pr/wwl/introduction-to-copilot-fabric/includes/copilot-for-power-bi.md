Copilot for Power BI is an AI-powered assistant designed to enhance the report creation and data exploration experience. It uses generative AI to help you interact with your data, create reports, and gain insights more efficiently. Copilot is available in both Power BI Desktop and the Power BI Service.

## Key concepts

Understanding the following fundamental concepts will help you leverage Copilot for Power BI effectively in your organization.

**Natural language interaction** makes it possible to communicate with your data using everyday language. If you’ve ever struggled to remember the exact field names or how to build a specific chart, Copilot lets you simply ask, “Show the top categories by sales,” or “Create a summary of this report.” This removes technical barriers and empowers users of all skill levels to explore data confidently.

With **report creation**, Copilot streamlines the process of building report pages. Instead of manually selecting visuals and fields, you can describe what you need, and Copilot will suggest appropriate visuals, fields, and measures. This is especially helpful if you’re unsure which chart best represents your data or if you want to quickly prototype a report for stakeholder review.

**Narrative visuals** address the common challenge of interpreting complex data. Copilot automatically generates narrative summaries for report pages or entire reports, providing clear context and actionable insights. This feature is invaluable when presenting findings to non-technical audiences or when you need to quickly grasp the story behind your data.

For those who find writing DAX formulas challenging, **DAX query assistance** simplifies the process. Copilot can generate DAX code from natural language prompts, making complex calculations more accessible and reducing the time spent troubleshooting syntax errors.

Understanding the structure of your data model can be daunting, especially in large projects. **Semantic model insights** help by summarizing and documenting measures, relationships, and suggesting synonyms to improve the Q&A experience. This makes it easier to maintain and share your models with colleagues.

Finally, **quick actions** such as fixing errors in DAX queries or explaining the logic behind them enable you to debug and optimize your reports efficiently. If you’ve ever been stuck on a formula or unsure why a calculation isn’t working, Copilot’s quick actions provide immediate support, helping you work smarter and more independently.

By mastering these concepts, you’ll be able to overcome common obstacles in Power BI and use Copilot to accelerate your workflow, improve accuracy, and communicate insights more effectively.

Here's an example of how you can interact with Copilot in the Power BI Desktop:
