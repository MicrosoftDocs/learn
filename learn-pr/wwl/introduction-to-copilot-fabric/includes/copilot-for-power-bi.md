Copilot for Power BI is an AI-powered assistant designed to enhance the report creation and data exploration experience. It uses generative AI to help you interact with your data, create reports, and gain insights more efficiently. Copilot is available in both Power BI Desktop and the Power BI Service.

## Key concepts

1. **Natural language interaction**  
   Copilot allows you to ask questions about your data or request specific visuals using natural language. For example, you can ask Copilot to "Show the top categories by sales" or "Create a summary of this report."

2. **Report creation**  
   Copilot can generate report pages based on user prompts. It suggests visuals, fields, and measures to include, ensuring that the report aligns with your requirements.

3. **Narrative visuals**  
   Copilot can create narrative summaries for report pages or entire reports. These summaries provide context and insights, making it easier to understand the data.

4. **DAX query assistance**  
   Copilot helps you write DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) queries by generating code based on natural language prompts. This feature simplifies complex calculations and enhances productivity.

5. **Semantic model insights**  
   Copilot can summarize and document the semantic model, including measures and relationships. It also suggests synonyms to improve the Q&A experience in reports.

6. **Quick actions**  
   Copilot provides quick actions such as fixing errors in DAX queries or explaining the logic behind them. These actions help you debug and optimize your reports.

Here's an example of how you can interact with Copilot in the Power BI Desktop:
