Let's first understand the context of Microsoft Fabric and its components.

## What is Microsoft Fabric?

Microsoft Fabric is a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) analytics platform that unifies core data and AI workloads—including data engineering, data integration, data warehousing, data science, real-time analytics, and business intelligence—into a single, cohesive experience. By delivering these capabilities as a managed SaaS offering, Fabric reduces infrastructure and integration overhead, streamlines collaboration, and helps users focus on turning data into actionable insights.

## What is Copilot for Fabric?

Copilot for Fabric is an AI-powered assistant that supports common tasks across Microsoft Fabric. It uses generative AI to help users transform and analyze data, generate insights, and create visualizations and reports.

Copilot for Fabric provides code suggestions, can automate routine processes, and enables natural language interactions. This helps reduce the learning curve for new users and supports moving from raw data to insights.

In the next sections, we'll outline components of Copilot for Fabric, including Copilot for Data Factory, Copilot for SQL Database, Copilot for Real-Time Intelligence, and Fabric Data Agents. Each component addresses specific use cases within Microsoft Fabric.
