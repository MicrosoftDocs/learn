  questions:
  - content: "Which Microsoft Fabric Real-Time Intelligence component should you use to ingest and transform a stream of real-time data?"
    choices:
    - content: "Eventhouse"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. An eventhouse is used to store real-time data in KQL databases."
    - content: "Eventstream"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. An eventstream is used to ingest and transform real-time data."
    - content: "Activator"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Activator is used to automate actions based on events."
  - content: "Which language is optimized for querying real-time data in an eventhouse?"
    choices:
    - content: "Python"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Python isn't supported for querying tables in an eventhouse."
    - content: "SQL"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While SQL is supported in an eventhouse, it isn't as optimized for real-time data as another supported language."
    - content: "KQL"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. KQL is the native language for databases in an eventstore and is optimized for handling real-time data."
  - content: "Which Microsoft Fabric Real-Time Intelligence component is used to visualize and explore real-time data in tiles?"
    choices:
    - content: "Dataflows"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Dataflows are used to ingest and process batch data, not to visualize real-time data in tiles."
    - content: "Real-Time Dashboards"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Real-Time Dashboards enable you to visualize and explore data in tiles based on KQL queries."
    - content: "Delta tables"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Delta tables are relational data structures used to store data in a lakehouse or data warehouse."
