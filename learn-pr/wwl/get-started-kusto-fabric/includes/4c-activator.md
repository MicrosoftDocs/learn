Activator is a technology in Microsoft Fabric that enables automated processing of events that trigger actions. For example, you can use Activator to notify you by email when a value in an Eventstream deviates from a specific range or to run a notebook to perform some Spark-based data processing logic when a real-time dashboard is updated.

## Understand Activator key concepts

Activator operates based on four core concepts: *Events*, *Objects*, *Properties*, and *Rules*.

- **Events** - Each record in a stream of data represents an *event* that has occurred at a specific point in time.
- **Objects** - The data in an event record can be used to represent an *object*, such as a sales order, a sensor, or some other business entity.
- **Properties** - The fields in the event data can be mapped to *properties* of the business object, representing some aspect of its state. For example, a *total_amount* field might represent a sales order total, or a *temperature* field might represent the temperature measured by an environmental sensor.
- **Rules** - The key to using Activator to automate actions based on events is to define *rules* that set conditions under which an action is triggered based on the property values of objects referenced in events. For example, you might define a rule that sends an email to a maintenance manager if the temperature measured by a sensor exceeds a specific threshold.

## Use cases for Activator

Activator can help you in various scenarios, such as dynamic inventory management, real-time customer engagement, and effective resource allocation in cloud environments. It's a powerful tool for any circumstance that requires real-time data analysis and automated actions.

Use Activator to:

- Initiate marketing actions when product sales drop.
- Send notifications when temperature changes could affect perishable goods.
- Flag real-time issues affecting the user experience on apps and websites.
- Trigger alerts when a shipment hasn't been updated within an expected time frame.
- Send alerts when a customer's account balance crosses a certain threshold.
- Respond to anomalies or failures in data processing workflows immediately.
- Run ads when same-store sales decline.
- Alert store managers to move food from failing grocery store freezers before it spoils.
