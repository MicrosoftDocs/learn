You explored the Real‑Time Hub for discovering streams, Eventstreams for ingesting and processing event data, and KQL databases in Eventhouses for fast, time‑based analytics using KQL. You also learned how to visualize streaming insights with Real‑Time dashboards and Power BI, and how to automate responses using Activator.
