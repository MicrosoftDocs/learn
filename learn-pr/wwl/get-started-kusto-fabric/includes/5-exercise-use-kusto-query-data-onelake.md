Now it's time to try out Fabric Real-Time Intelligence for yourself.

In this exercise, you'll ingest real-time data into Microsoft Fabric. You'll then query and visualize the data before defining an alert to automate an action based on a threshold value in the real-time data stream.

> [!NOTE]
> You need a Microsoft Fabric tenant to complete this exercise. For more information about accessing Microsoft Fabric, see [**Getting started with Fabric**](/fabric/get-started/fabric-trial).
