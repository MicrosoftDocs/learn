Real-time analytics is the practice of processing, analyzing, and acting on data as it's generated, typically within seconds to minutes of when events occur. Unlike traditional analytics that works with static snapshots of historical data stored in databases, real-time analytics operates on data that's actively flowing through your systems, enabling immediate insights and rapid responses to changing conditions. This approach is also known as *near* real-time analytics, since there's always some degree of processing and network latency involved.

## Understand events and streams

In data systems, *events* are records of things that happen in a system. They capture moments when something occurs, changes or is completed. Examples include website clicks, stock price changes, customer purchases, patient vital sign changes, or equipment sensor readings. Think of them as digital records or log entries that document activity across your systems.  

A *stream* is essentially a sequence of events, typically ordered by the time an event occurred. Each event in the stream represents something that happened at a specific moment. Events flow through streams continuously as they occur. For example, a stream of equipment temperature sensor readings contains temperature readings over many points of time. That means that a stream contains the event information needed to detect patterns over time or to identify opportunities or risks and take action immediately after something happens, or in *real-time*.

Streams are the delivery mechanism that carries events from where they happen to where they need to be processed, analyzed, or acted upon.

> [!NOTE]
> While events are the most common type of streaming data, streams can also carry other types of real-time data such as continuous metrics, log entries, and time-series measurements. However, events provide a particularly effective structure for real-time analytics because they capture discrete occurrences of system activities that can be used to trigger specific actions and responses.

## Components of real-time analytics solutions

Real-time analytics extends beyond processing event streams. To build real-time solutions, you need several integrated capabilities working together:

**Real-time data ingestion:** Collect data from multiple sources simultaneously - database changes (Change Data Capture or CDC), sensors, applications, system logs, and APIs - as information is generated.

**Stream processing:** Analyze data while it's in motion, perform operations like filtering, aggregating, joining with other data sources, and detect patterns with minimal latency. Data may be temporarily buffered for processing but flows through the system continuously.

**Low-latency storage:** Use specialized databases and storage systems designed to handle high-velocity data writes and provide instant query responses.

**Interactive dashboards:** Create visualizations that update automatically as new data arrives, show current state and trends in real-time.

**Automated decision making:** Set up event-driven rules and triggers that can initiate actions, send alerts, or start workflows based on real-time conditions.

**Complex event processing:** Identify meaningful patterns across multiple event streams, such as correlating user behavior with system performance or detecting fraud by analyzing transaction patterns.

## Use real-time analytics

To leverage real-time data effectively, information has to be ingested, processed, stored, analyzed and presented to be actionable. Real-time analytics enables you to:

- **Respond immediately** to opportunities or problems as they emerge
- **Optimize operations** by adjusting resources and configurations based on current conditions  
- **Enhance customer experiences** through personalized, contextual interactions
- **Prevent issues** by detecting anomalies before they become critical problems

Real-Time Intelligence in Microsoft Fabric brings all these capabilities together in a single platform. Through components like eventstreams for data ingestion and transformation, eventhouses for analytics-optimized storage, the Real-Time hub for data discovery, Real-Time dashboards for visualization, and Activator for automated alerts and actions, Real-Time Intelligence enables you to monitor system health, trigger automated responses, track business processes, and analyze patterns in real-time, turning what happens in your systems into actionable insights.
