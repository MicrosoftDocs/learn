Synapse Real-Time Analytics provides an end-to-end streaming solution for high-speed data analysis across the Fabric service. Itâ€™s optimized for time-series data and supports automatic partitioning and indexing of any data format.

Real-Time Analytics delivers high performance for data of various sizes, ranging from a few gigabytes to several petabytes. It can handle data from different sources and in various formats. Fabric's Real-Time Analytics workload can be used for solutions like IoT and log analytics in many scenarios including manufacturing, oil and gas, and automotive.

## Understand Real-Time Analytics in Microsoft Fabric

Real-Time Analytics is a fully managed service that is optimized for streaming time-series data. With Real-Time Analytics you're able to get consistent performance searching all types of data, which includes structured, unstructured, and semi-structured data at scale. Additionally, it's fully integrated with the entire suite of Fabric capabilities, which allows tight integration of loading and visualization.

By Using Real-Time Analytics in Fabric, you can:

- Ingest data from any source, in any data format.
- Run analytical queries directly on raw data without the need to build complex data models or create scripting to transform the data.
- Import data with by-default streaming that provides high performance, low latency, high freshness data analysis.
- Imported data undergoes default partitioning - both time and hash-based partitioning, and by-default indexing.
- Work with versatile data structures and query structured, semi-structured, or free text.
Query raw data without transformation, with high performance, incredibly low response time, and using a wide variety of available operators.
- Scale to an unlimited amount of data, from gigabytes to petabytes, with unlimited scale on concurrent queries and concurrent users.
- Integrate seamlessly with other workloads and items in Microsoft Fabric.

### Kusto Query Language (KQL)

Kusto Query Language (KQL) is a declarative query language used to analyze and extract insights from structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data. KQL was designed specifically for searching large-scale log data efficiently and quickly, making it perfectly suited for cloud-based data analytics. We'll explore some basic KQL syntax later in this module, but for now, consider the following benefits of the KQL capabilities in Microsoft Fabric:

- It enables **efficiency in data exploration and data analysis** by allowing users to work with heterogeneous data sources and visualize the results in various ways.
- It supports **reproducible analyses** by allowing users to create notebooks with Kusto kernel that can capture code, results and context on the analysis.
- It improves **DevOps troubleshooting experience** by allowing users to create runbooks or playbooks in notebooks with Kusto kernel that can detail how to troubleshoot and mitigate issues using telemetry data.
- It enriches **DevOps flow** by allowing users to add KQL files and KQL notebook files to their Git repositories and CI/CD pipelines.
- It provides **guidance and helps you build search queries from scratch** by using the KQL editor that quickly identifies potential errors and displays hints about how to resolve issues.
- It lets you **quickly paste long, complex queries directly into the editor** if you receive them from other sources.
- It allows you to **filter, present, and aggregate your data** using various operators and functions that are easy to read and author.
