Real-Time Dashboards provide a way to pin data visualizations to a single visual interface, enabling you to surface real-time insights at a glance. Each *tile* in a dashboard shows you different information based on a KQL query that extracts real-time data from tables in an eventhouse.

## Create a Real-Time Dashboard

You can create a Real-Time Dashboard in a workspace and then configure its source, or you can create one directly from a KQL queryset in an eventhouse.

Dashboards are composed of one or more *tiles*, each containing a visualization based on a KQL query expression. By default, the visualization shows the results of the query as a table; but you can edit the tile to customize how the data is displayed.

When published, tiles let you explore the data they contain interactively by drilling into the data and using a visual interface to filter and aggregate the data, and change the visualization type.

## Visualize real-time data with Power BI

You also can create Power BI reports from your KQL database data.
