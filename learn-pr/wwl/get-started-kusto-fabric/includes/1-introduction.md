Microsoft Fabric provides an end-to-end platform for data solutions, including real-time data analytics. Synapse Real-Time Analytics in Fabric uses a KQL Database to provide table storage and Kusto Query Language (KQL) which is a powerful tool for analyzing data. This structure provides an efficient way to find insights and patterns from textual or structured data. Moreover, KQL is optimized for data that includes a time series component, such as real-time data from log files or streaming services. With Real-Time Analytics, you can focus and scale up your analytics solution while democratizing data for the needs for your entire data organization.

In Fabric, you only need a source and a Kusto database to start streaming data in and out of Fabric and writing your queries using KQL. Microsoft Fabric also provides KQL querysets that can be shared within the tenant and Power BI using what's known as quick create.
