You can create custom prompts in Microsoft Security Copilot to access specific information about your Intune data. Be clear and specific with your prompts, including details like device IDs, app names, or policy names for better results. For example, use prompts like “According to Intune, how many devices were enrolled this week?” or “Tell me about Intune devices for [user name].” Experiment with different variations to see what works best, and save effective prompts in a promptbook for future use. This section lists some ideas and examples.

### Before you begin

- Be clear and specific with your prompts. You might get better results if you include specific device IDs or names, app names, or policy names in your prompts.

  It might also help to add **Intune** to your prompt, like:

  - **According to Intune, how many devices were enrolled this week**?
  - **Tell me about Intune devices for (user name)**.

- Experiment with different prompts and variations to see what works best for your use case. Chat AI models vary, so iterate and refine your prompts based on the results you receive.  

  You can also save your prompts in a promptbook for future use. For more information, go to:
