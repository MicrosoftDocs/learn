PL-300: Module 6 Optimize model performance 

Module 6 Overview 

As you begin to teach this module, get familiar with what the students will learn during the module. In this module, students will learn about optimizing their data model performance, relation to visuals, and how everything comes in at the start. They will also look at the data source and how the data source is coming in. 

This module consists of three lessons: 

- Lesson 1 – Optimize the data model for performance 
- Lesson 2 – Identify poorly performing measures, relationships, and visuals 
- Lesson 3 – Reduce cardinality levels to improve performance
