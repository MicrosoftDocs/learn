The PL-300: Microsoft Power BI Data Analyst course is meant to be an introduction to Power BI and includes a lot of time with the Power BI Desktop and then moves into the Power BI service so learners will be ready to use the Power BI tool by the end of the course. Demos are provided in the trainer materials; however you may want to use a lab environment to go through some of the steps in the lab to demonstrate the examples. Showing examples in a lab environment will also provide your learners with a head start on the actual labs. 

Use the trainer demos and your own experience to demonstrate each module’s purpose and watch for links to additional information that you’ll want to share with your students. 

Before we begin, make sure you use the most up-to-date version of the Microsoft Official Curriculum (MOC). It is recommended that you log into the [Learning Download Center](https://aka.ms/ldc) (LDC) at least quarterly. If you have not already done so, please download the course materials from the LDC before continuing in this learning path.
