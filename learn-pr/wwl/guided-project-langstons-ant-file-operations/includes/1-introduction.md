Langston's Ant is a simulation of an ant walking along a grid. The ant follows a set of simple rules: it turns right if it's on a white square, and left if it's on a black square. Each time the ant moves to a new square, the square color changes from either black to white, or white to black. As the ant continues moving, it creates a pattern that slowly becomes more complex and interesting to observe. This simulation demonstrates how simple rules can create complex behaviors.

Suppose you want to save or view a simulation state. You may want to use file operations to read or write the simulation data to and from a file. This module guides you through the steps to modify a Langston's Ant simulation to save and load the simulation state. By the end of this module, your project use file operations to read and write the state of the simulation.
