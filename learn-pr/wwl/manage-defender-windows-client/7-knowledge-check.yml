  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "Contoso has implemented Microsoft Defender Antivirus on all company devices to help prevent spyware and other unwanted software from running on any of its computers. As a best practice, Contoso schedules a daily Quick scan on each device. If Microsoft Defender Antivirus identifies a potentially dangerous file during a scan, what action does it take?"
    choices:
    - content: "Flags it as being potentially infected"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This action isn't performed by Microsoft Defender Antivirus when a scan detects a potentially harmful file. Try again."
    - content: "Removes the file"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This action isn't performed by Microsoft Defender Antivirus when a scan detects a potentially harmful file. Try again."
    - content: "Moves the file to a quarantine area"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. When Microsoft Defender Antivirus detects a potentially harmful file, it moves the file to a quarantine area, and it does not allow it to run or allow other processes to access it. Once the scan is complete, you can open the Scan history page, and in the Quarantined threats section, you can choose to Remove or Restore each discovered threat."
  - content: "What feature of Windows Defender Credential Guard blocks the credential theft attack techniques and tools used in many targeted attacks?"
    choices:
    - content: "Virtualization-based security"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The credential theft attack techniques and tools used in many targeted attacks are blocked when Credential Manager domain credentials, NTLM, and Kerberos-derived credentials are protected using virtualization-based security. Malware running in the operating system with administrative privileges can't extract secrets that are protected by virtualization-based security."
    - content: "Local Security Authority (LSA)"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Previous versions of Windows stored secrets in the Local Security Authority (LSA). It's still part of the process used by Credential Guard, but it doesn't protect data stored by the isolated LSA process. Try again."
    - content: "Group Policy"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Group Policy can be used to enable Credential Guard, but it isn't a feature of Credential Guard. Try again."
