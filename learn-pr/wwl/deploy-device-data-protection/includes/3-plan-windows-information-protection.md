Planning for the usage of WIP in your organization is crucial because it not only helps to address the shortcomings of DLP and IRM systems but also enables you to explore innovative approaches to data management.

WIP helps you to overcome several common challenges by providing:

 -  **Separation between personal and corporate data:** Users don't need to choose which app to use for which data.
 -  **Additional protection to LOB apps:** You can add protection without modifying the app.
 -  **Ability to perform a selective wipe:** You can remove corporate data from a device without removing personal data.
 -  **Audit reporting:**. WIP gives you the ability to track and report on policy issues and the actions performed in response to policy violations.
 -  **Management system integration:** WIP integrates with Intune, Endpoint Configuration Manager, and other Mobile Device Management (MDM) systems. These benefits help you protect enterprise data in various scenarios:
 -  **Encrypt data on a device:** When you are copying or downloading organizational data from SharePoint, Microsoft OneDrive, network shares, or other locations using a device that is managed by using WIP policies, WIP encrypts the data on the device, even if the device is personally owned.
 -  **Control which apps can access corporate data:** Apps that you've included on the Allowed Apps list can access organizational data, while apps that aren't on the list have more limited capabilities. For example, if the policy is set to Override mode, when a user tries to copy data from an allowed app to a personal app, a warning notice will ask for confirmation to perform a potentially unsafe action.
 -  **Enlighted apps allow users to work with both personal and corporate data:** Some apps, such as Word, automatically detect when a file contains corporate data and should be WIP-protected, and they maintain that protection when saving a file locally or on removable media. This protection is maintained even if the file name changes or if the data is stored with unencrypted personal data.
 -  **Prevent use of personal apps and services:** You can prevent accidental release of organizational data to public spaces and social media by preventing users from using applications such as personal OneDrive to store files. You can also prevent users from copying data from allowed apps to Twitter or Facebook.
 -  **Remove corporate data from lost or stolen devices, or devices owned by ex-employees:** You can remove organizational data from, and unenroll, any devices that are enrolled in Intune, including personal devices, even if the device is lost or stolen. This is a necessary protection when employees leave the company and it doesn’t affect personal data.
