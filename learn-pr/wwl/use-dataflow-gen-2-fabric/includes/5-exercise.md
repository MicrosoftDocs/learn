In this module, we walked through a scenario where both data engineers and data analysts have a need to prepare data for consumption and expand datasets. We identified Dataflows (Gen2) as the best solution for the data transformation steps. In this exercise, you create and use a Dataflow (Gen2) to ingest transformed data into a Lakehouse.
