  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "What is a Dataflow Gen2?"
    choices:
    - content: "A hybrid database that supports ACID transactions."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A Fabric Lakehouse is a hybrid database storage layer that supports transactional data consistency."
    - content: "A way to export data to Power BI Desktop."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A Dataflow Gen2 is intended for transformations on a semantic model."
    - content: "A way to import and transform data with Power Query Online."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Dataflow Gen2 allows you to get and transform data, then optionally ingest to a Lakehouse."
  - content: "Which workload experience lets you create a Dataflow Gen2?"
    choices:
    - content: "Real-time analytics."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Real-time analytics is for Kusto workloads."
    - content: "Data warehouse."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The Data warehouse workload is primarily for importing data."
    - content: "Data Factory."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Data Factory and Power BI workloads allow Dataflow Gen2 creation."
  - content: "You need to connect to and transform data to be loaded into a Fabric Lakehouse and also loaded into a KQL Database for Real-time Analytics. You aren't comfortable using Spark notebooks, so decide to use Dataflows Gen2. How would you complete this task?"
    choices:
    - content: "Connect to Data Factory workload > Create Dataflows Gen2 to transform data > Create Data pipeline to include your dataflow and then land data to a KQL Database."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. These are the high-level steps to accomplish your task."
    - content: "Connect to Real-time Analytics workload > Create Pipeline to copy data > Transform data with an Eventstream."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Eventstreams and the Real-time analytics workload are not meant for data integration."
    - content: "Connect to Data Factory workload > Create Pipeline to copy data and load to Lakehouse > Transform directly in the Lakehouse."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Data transformation in the lakehouse isn't as efficient as using Dataflows Gen2."
