  questions:
  - content: "What is a Dataflow Gen2?"
    choices:
    - content: "A hybrid database that supports ACID transactions."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A Fabric lakehouse is a hybrid database storage layer that supports transactional data consistency."
    - content: "A way to export data to Power BI Desktop."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A Dataflow Gen2 is intended for transformations on a semantic model."
    - content: "A way to import and transform data with Power Query Online."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Dataflow Gen2 allows you to get and transform data, then optionally ingest to a lakehouse."
  - content: "Which workload experience lets you create a Dataflow Gen2?"
    choices:
    - content: "Real-time intelligence."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Real-time intelligence is for streaming and Kusto workloads."
    - content: "Data warehouse."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The Data warehouse workload is primarily for importing data."
    - content: "Data Factory."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Data Factory and Power BI workloads allow Dataflow Gen2 creation."
  - content: "You need to connect to and transform data to be loaded into a Fabric lakehouse. You aren't comfortable using Spark notebooks, so decide to use Dataflows Gen2. How would you complete this task?"
    choices:
    - content: "Connect to Data Factory workload > Create a Dataflow Gen2 to transform data > add your lakehouse as the data destination."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. These are the high-level steps to accomplish your task."
    - content: "Connect to Real-time intelligence workload > Create Pipeline to copy data > Transform data with an Eventstream."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Eventstreams and the Real-time intelligence workload are not meant for data integration."
    - content: "Connect to Data Factory workload > Create Pipeline to copy data and load to lakehouse > Transform directly in the lakehouse."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Data transformation in the lakehouse isn't as efficient as using Dataflows Gen2."
