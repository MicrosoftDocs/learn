  questions:
  - content: "You have access to a historical dataset that contains the monthly expenses of the marketing department. You want to generate predictions of the expenses for the coming month. Which type of machine learning model is needed?"
    choices:
    - content: "Classification"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Classification is used when you want to predict a categorical value."
    - content: "Regression"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Regression is used when you want to predict numerical values."
    - content: "Forecasting"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Forecasting is used when you want to predict future numerical values based on time-series data."
  - content: "Which feature in Microsoft Fabric should you use to review the results of MLflow's tracking through a user interface?"
    choices:
    - content: "Notebooks"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. You can use MLflow in a notebook to review tracked metrics. However, when working with notebooks you need to write code and don't use a user interface."
    - content: "Experiments"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Microsoft Fabric's experiments offers a visual user interface to explore the metrics."
    - content: "Models"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Metrics are only shown when a model is saved."
  - content: "You want to log the accuracy of a model, which logging function should you use?"
    choices:
    - content: "`mlflow.log_param()`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. `log_param()` logs a single key-value input parameter."
    - content: "`mlflow.log_metric()`"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. `log_metric()` logs a single key-value metric."
    - content: "`mlflow.log_artifact()`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. `log_artifact()` logs a file."
