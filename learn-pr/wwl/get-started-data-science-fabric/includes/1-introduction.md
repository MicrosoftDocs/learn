Data science allows you to identify patterns and generate insights from large amounts of data. In Microsoft Fabric, you can train machine learning models in *notebooks*, and track them with *experiments*.

This module explores how you can do your data science workloads in Microsoft Fabric. As a data scientist, you may prefer to experiment in notebooks as it allows you to quickly iterate and explore different approaches to training a machine learning model. You can use the open-source library **MLflow** to track your work, which integrates with **experiments** in Microsoft Fabric.
