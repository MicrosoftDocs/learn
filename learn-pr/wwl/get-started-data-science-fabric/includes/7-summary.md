Microsoft Fabric offers one central workspace to perform data science from beginning to end.

To perform data science, you need to first define the problem. Then, you can identify the data you need and ingest it into Microsoft Fabric. When you've ingested your data, you can explore and prepare your data, using notebooks or the Data Wrangler.

To train machine learning models as part of your data science project, you can track your work with experiments. To use a model to generate insights, you can use the built-in PREDICT function.
