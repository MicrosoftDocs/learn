Data Activator in Microsoft Fabric takes action based on what's happening in your data. Consider the following three scenarios:  

- A warehouse manager needs to detect drops in product stocks and needs to start a reorder process to prevent running out of stock.
- A sales associate needs to receive alerts when a potential client is visiting their website and offers to start a live chat with them.  
- A network administrator detects potential security breaches through real-time monitoring and initiates immediate protective actions.  

Data Activator experience covers all those scenarios because it allows Fabric to operate and act from events that are generated and processed from data streams.  

Data Activator is the right tool for scenarios where you want to evaluate conditions against your data, and trigger action from those conditions. Whether you require data ingestion from different experiences like *EventStreams*, need to trigger *Power Automate* flows, or want to visualize data in real-time with *Power BI*, Data Activator facilitates it seamlessly.  

This module aims to provide an overview of Data Activator, its architecture, and how it can be used to monitor and respond to real-time data streams. By the end of this module, you have a firm foundation to start using Data Activator effectively.
