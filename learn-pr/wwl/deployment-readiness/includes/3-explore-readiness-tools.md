To ensure a successful and efficient Windows deployment, you need to understand where your current state is today, so that you can plan where you need to be after the deployment project. There are several tools available to help you assess and understand the current state of your environment, including identifying potential issues that could prevent successful deployments.

#### Microsoft Intune

You can use the solutions in Microsoft Intune to maintain corporate compliance and control, while providing employees access to the devices and applications they need to be productive. Microsoft Intune provides key management capabilities in application delivery, desktop virtualization, device management, and security. Organizations using Microsoft Intune can view reports and run queries on the assets it manages, including complete inventory of the OS, software, and hardware.

#### Endpoint Analytics

Endpoint analytics is a cloud-based service that provides insights for measuring how your organization is working and the quality of the experience you're delivering to your users. Endpoint Analytics provides Windows 11 hardware readiness reports in the Work from Anywhere report. This report shows which devices are capable of running Windows 11, and lists reasons for devices that don't meet Windows 11 readiness. While Endpoint Analytics can leverage devices that are managed in Configuration Manager and co-managed devices, unlike Desktop Analytics, Endpoint Analytics doesn't require Configuration Manager.
