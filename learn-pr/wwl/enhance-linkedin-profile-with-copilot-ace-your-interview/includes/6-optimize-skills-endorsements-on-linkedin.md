## Building endorsements to strengthen your LinkedIn profile

Endorsements validate your skills, showing potential employers and connections that others recognize your expertise. As a student, building endorsements enhances credibility and demonstrates your abilities—even if you're still developing formal work experience.

### Best practices for students to earn endorsements

- Engage with classmates, professors, and mentors - Ask for endorsements from those who have seen your skills in action (e.g., team projects, internships, or coursework).
- Support your peers first - Endorse classmates for relevant skills; many will return the favor.
- Leverage student organizations and projects - If you've led a group or contributed to a major academic project, request endorsements related to your role.
- Stay involved in industry discussions - Join LinkedIn groups for students in your field, participate in conversations, and connect with professionals.

### Example endorsement strategies for students

- Team research projects - Ask teammates to endorse skills like data analysis or collaboration.
- Hackathons or case competitions - Request endorsements for problem-solving, leadership, or technical skills.
- Professors and mentors - If someone recognizes your strengths, ask if they'd be willing to endorse skills relevant to your career goals. Some may decline, but many will support your request—so it's always worth asking.

By actively engaging with your network and strategically requesting endorsements, you can boost credibility, improve visibility, and strengthen your professional presence—even as a student.
