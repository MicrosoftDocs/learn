quiz:
  questions:
  - content: "You have a prepared dataset that you loaded into a notebook. You want to train a classification model. What should you do before training the model?"
    choices:
    - content: "Split the data."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. When you train a model you need the dataset split into a training and test dataset, with the features and label separated."
    - content: "Score the model."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. You need to train the model before you can use it to score."
    - content: "Evaluate the model."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. You need to train the model before you can evaluate the model."
  - content: "Which feature in Microsoft Fabric allows you to write and run code to train models?"
    choices:
    - content: "Notebooks"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Use notebooks to write and run code."
    - content: "Experiments"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Experiments allow you to review your work."
    - content: "Models"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Models show the models you've trained and saved."
  - content: "You want to log the accuracy of a model, which logging function should you use?"
    choices:
    - content: "`mlflow.log_param()`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. `log_param()` logs a single key-value input parameter."
    - content: "`mlflow.log_metric()`"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. `log_metric()` logs a single key-value metric."
    - content: "`mlflow.log_artifact()`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. `log_artifact()` logs a file."
