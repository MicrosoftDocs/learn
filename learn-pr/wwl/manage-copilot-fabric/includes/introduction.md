Copilot for Microsoft Fabric is an AI-based assistant embedded within Microsoft Fabric, designed to support productivity and help with complex tasks. Copilot uses machine learning and natural language processing to assist with data analysis, code generation, and workflow automation. It helps make data operations accessible to both technical and nontechnical users.

## Features of Copilot for Microsoft Fabric

- **Natural Language Querying**: You can interact with data using everyday natural language.
- **Automated Code Generation**: Copilot can generate code snippets for data transformations, visualizations, and machine learning models based on descriptions.
- **Data Insights Automation**: It identifies patterns, trends, and anomalies in datasets, providing proactive insights and recommendations.

## Data teams and Microsoft Copilot for Microsoft Fabric

Copilot and other generative AI features in preview bring new ways to transform and analyze data, generate insights, and create visualizations and reports in Microsoft Fabric and Power BI. These capabilities are designed to empower all data practitioners, including:

**Data engineers** can ingest, transform, and load large amounts of data into OneLake and present it in whichever data store makes most sense. Data loading patterns are simplified by using natural language to articulate your requirements for creating data integration solutions using Dataflow Gen2.

**Data analysts** can create Fabric Data agents to type questions and retrieve relevant insights from their data, making it easier to access and analyze information without needing advanced query skills.

**Data scientists** can use Copilot to generate code for data preparation, visualization, model training, and evaluation, supporting common steps in the data science workflow.

**Analytics engineers** bridge the gap between data engineering and data analysis by curating data store assets, ensuring data quality, and enabling self-service analytics. Copilot can generate T-SQL queries based on natural language prompts to assist with querying.

**Low-to-no-code users** and **citizen developers** can now answer data questions in Power BI and create DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) queries without being dependent on data engineers.
