  questions:
  - content: "What is the primary function of Eventstream?"
    choices:
    - content: "Performing batch loading of data into a data warehouse."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Eventstream isn't a batch loading technology."
    - content: "Running Apache Spark notebooks and jobs."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Eventstream isn't used primarily to run Spark code."
    - content: "Ingesting and transforming real-time data."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Eventstream is used to ingest and transform real-time data."
  - content: "What do temporal window transformations enable you to do?"
    choices:
    - content: "Aggregate event data in a stream based on specific time periods."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Temporal windows enable aggregation of events over time periods."
    - content: "Automatically enable and disable streaming at scheduled times."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Temporal windows aren't used for scheduling."
    - content: "Delete expired data after a specified retention period."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Temporal windows aren't used to delete expired data."
  - content: "What is the purpose of the Fabric Activator destination in an Eventstream?"
    choices:
    - content: "Data sent to an Activator destination can be used to trigger an automated action based on data values."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The Activator destination is used to trigger automated actions."
    - content: "Ingested data in a lakehouse or Eventhouse isn't visible until activated by the Fabric Activator."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Data loaded into a lakehouse or Eventhouse doesn't need to be activated before becoming visible."
    - content: "The Activator resets any transformations that were applied in the Eventstream, returning the data to a clean state."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The Activator destination doesn't reset transformations."
