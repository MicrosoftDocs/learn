*Eventstream* in Real-Time Intelligence enables you to capture, transform, and route real-time events without needing to write any code. You can set up event sources, destinations, and transformations in the eventstream, enabling you to collect, then optionally process data before routing it into a destination.

Some of the main benefits of eventstream in Fabric are:

- You can capture, transform, and route data to various destinations. You can use the drag and drop feature to create your event data processing logic without writing any code.
- There are multiple source connectors to ingest event data from different sources, such as Azure Event Hubs, Azure IoT Hub, Azure storage, Apache Kafka, and others.
- You can send data to a wide range of destinations for storage, further analysis or processing. 

In this module, you'll learn how to create eventstreams and use them to ingest and transform data in motion, and route it to destinations for further processing and analysis.
