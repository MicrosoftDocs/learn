The Microsoft Intune admin center allows administrators to view device and applications based on the criteria they define, and can create common reports, such as a device compliance. For more robust reporting, Administrators can use Power BI to connect to the Intune Data Warehouse and build robust reports using the vast amount of data Intune collects. The Microsoft Graph API for Intune provides a programmatic method for extracting data and using in an organization's existing reporting tool.
