### Device compliance report

The Device Compliance report shows all the compliance states for devices to give a broader view of the data, no matter how large the dataset. This report shows the full breakdown of records in a visualization of aggregated metrics. This report can be generated by applying filters for compliance status, OS, and type of ownership. Selecting the "Generate report" button will refresh the data to show the latest state with the ability to view the individual records that make up the aggregate data. These records can be sorted and searched upon to focus on the information you need.

1.  Sign in to the **Microsoft Intune admin center**.
2.  Select **Reports** > **Device compliance**.
3.  In the details pane, select the **Reports** tab, then select the **Device compliance** option.
4.  Select the **Compliance status**, **OS**, and **Ownership** filters to refine your report.
5.  Select **Generate report** (or Generate again) to retrieve current data.

1.  Sign in to the **Microsoft Intune admin center**.
