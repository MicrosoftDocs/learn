Apache Spark is an open source parallel processing framework for large-scale data processing and analytics. Spark has become popular in "big data" processing scenarios, and is available in multiple platform implementations; including Azure HDInsight, Azure Databricks, Azure Synapse Analytics, and Microsoft Fabric.

This module explores how you can use Spark in Microsoft Fabric to ingest, process, and analyze data in a lakehouse. While the core techniques and code described in this module are common to all Spark implementations, the integrated tools and ability to work with Spark in the same environment as other data services in Microsoft Fabric makes it easier to incorporate Spark-based data processing into your overall data analytics solution.
