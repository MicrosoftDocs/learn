  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "You want to use Apache Spark to explore data interactively in Microsoft Fabric. What should you create?"
    choices:
    - content: "A Spark job definition."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A Spark job definition will run Spark code, but is not the best choice for interactive analytics."
    - content: "A Data Factory pipeline."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A Data Factory pipeline is not an interactive Spark environment."
    - content: "A notebook."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Notebooks enable you to run Spark code interactively."
  - content: "You need to use Spark to analyze data in a CSV file. What's the simplest way to accomplish this goal?"
    choices:
    - content: "Load the file into a dataframe."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. You can load data from files in many formats, including CSV, into a Spark dataframe."
    - content: "Import the data into a table in a warehouse."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. You do not need to load the data into a warehouse in order to analyze it with Spark."
    - content: "Convert the data to Parquet format."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While you could load the data into Spark from a Parquet file, you do not need to convert the data from CSV format in order to use it in Spark."
  - content: "Which method is used to split the data across folders when saving a dataframe?"
    choices:
    - content: "`splitBy`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The `splitBy` method isn't used to partition data across folders"
    - content: "`distributeBy`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The `distributeBy` method isn't used to split across folders when saving a DataFrame."
    - content: "`partitionBy`"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. The `partitionBy` method partitions the dataframe based on specified columns."
