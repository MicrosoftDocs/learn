Imagine you're an analyst at a bike sharing company that operates across neighborhoods in a city. As bikes are rented and returned throughout the day, your company needs to monitor current bike availability and dock capacity to make operational decisions like redistributing bikes to high-demand areas.

You can use real-time dashboards in Microsoft Fabric to monitor this changing data. Real-time dashboards connect to KQL databases in Eventhouses and display visualizations that refresh automatically to show current data. Unlike traditional reports that show historical snapshots, real-time dashboards can be configured to refresh frequently, enabling you to monitor changing conditions and respond to current information.

In this module, you'll learn how to create real-time dashboards in Microsoft Fabric and connect them to KQL databases that contain your data.
