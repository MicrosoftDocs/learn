Imagine you're an analyst in a company that provides bicycles for a bike sharing scheme in a large city. The business depends on real-time data relating to bike availability in different neighborhoods across the city. The challenge is to create a real-time dashboard that can provide real-time insights into the number of bikes and parking docks in multiple locations. This dashboard should be easy to use, accessible, and secure. It should also allow for data exploration, filtering, and drill-down capabilities. This scenario is common in many industries where real-time data analysis is crucial for decision making.

In this module, you'll explore real-time dashboards in Microsoft Fabric, and learn how to create and use them to visualize and explore real-time data.
