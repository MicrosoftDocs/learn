    - content: "They allow users to ask questions in plain English and receive context-rich answers from enterprise data."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct.Microsoft  Fabric Data Agents make data insights accessible through natural language queries."
    - content: "They require users to write complex SQL queries for every data request."
      isCorrect: false

    - content: "They only work with Power BI and don't support other data sources."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Microsoft Fabric Data Agents support multiple data sources."
  - content: "What defines the scope of data a Microsoft Fabric Data Agent can access to answer user questions?"
    choices:
    - content: "The example queries provided during setup"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Example queries guide intent but don't expand data access."
    - content: "The data sources explicitly connected (grounded) to the agent"

  - content: "When integrating Azure AI Foundry with Microsoft Fabric Data Agents, what is required for secure data access?"
    choices:
    - content: "Users must have the Azure AI User RBAC role and read access to the agent and its data sources."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. These permissions are required for secure access."
