Fabric Data Agents are designed to revolutionize how organizations interact with their data by using generative AI. Below are the key capabilities that make Fabric Data Agents a powerful tool for enhancing data accessibility and usability:

## Chat with your data

The data agent allows users to interact with data naturally using plain English questions. This capability makes data insights accessible to everyone in the organization by eliminating the need for technical expertise in query languages like SQL (Structured Query Language), DAX (Data Analysis Expressions), or KQL (Kusto Query Language).

## Chat canvas for creators

Fabric Data Agents provide a chat canvas for creators that includes debugging capabilities. This feature enables creators to understand how the agent processes questions, refine responses by testing and iterating on queries, and debug and optimize the agent's behavior to ensure accurate and relevant answers.

## Seamless reasoning across multiple data sources

Fabric Data Agents can reason over multiple data sources, including:

- Power BI semantic models.
- Eventhouse KQL Databases.
- Lakehouses and Warehouses.

This capability enables the creation of a powerful "Data Expert" tailored to your organization's data domain, providing comprehensive and context-aware insights.

## Integration inside and outside of Fabric

Your Data Agent can be consumed both within and outside of Microsoft Fabric. Integrations include:

- **Copilot Studio**: Extend the agent's functionality to custom workflows.
- **Microsoft Teams**: Enable collaborative data-driven discussions.
- **Azure AI Foundry**: Use advanced AI capabilities for broader applications.
- **Custom Applications**: Embed the agent into your own tools and platforms.

These integrations ensure that Fabric Data Agents can seamlessly fit into your organization's existing ecosystem, enhancing collaboration and decision-making.
