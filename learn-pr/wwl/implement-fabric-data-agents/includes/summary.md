**Microsoft Fabric data agents** are AI-based tools that enable users to interact with enterprise data using natural language. They simplify access to information stored in Fabric OneLake by allowing users to ask plain English questions and receive responses based on the underlying data.

With Microsoft Fabric data agents, users can ask questions about their data in plain English, without needing to know technical languages like SQL, DAX, or KQL. The platform provides a chat interface with debugging tools to refine and improve agent responses. Data agents can connect to a variety of data sources, including Power BI models, Eventhouse KQL databases, Lakehouses, and Warehouses, supporting analysis across multiple platforms. They also integrate with Fabric and external services such as Microsoft Teams, Copilot Studio, Azure AI Foundry, and custom applications.

## Best practices

- Use clear, domain-specific instructions.
- Integrate with Azure AI Foundry for advanced AI capabilities and secure, permission-based data access.
- Use Copilot in Power BI to support natural language interactions with Fabric resources.
