**Microsoft Fabric Data Agents** are AI-powered tools that enable users to interact with enterprise data using natural language. They simplify access to insights stored in Fabric OneLake by allowing users to ask plain English questions and receive accurate, context-aware answers.

With Microsoft Fabric Data Agents, users can ask questions about their data in plain English, without needing to know technical languages like SQL, DAX, or KQL. The platform provides a chat interface equipped with debugging tools, making it easy to refine and improve agent responses. Data Agents can connect to a variety of data sources, including Power BI models, Eventhouse KQL databases, Lakehouses, and Warehouses, enabling comprehensive analysis across multiple platforms. Additionally, they integrate seamlessly with both Fabric and external services such as Microsoft Teams, Copilot Studio, Azure AI Foundry, and custom applications.

## Best practices

- Use clear, domain-specific instructions.
- Integrate with Azure AI Foundry for advanced AI capabilities and secure, permission-based data access.
- Leverage Copilot in Power BI to enhance natural language interactions with Fabric resources.
