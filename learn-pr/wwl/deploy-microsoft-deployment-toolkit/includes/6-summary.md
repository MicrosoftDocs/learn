Imaging has been used traditionally for years to deploy operating system (OS) images to devices. While modern methods have introduced solutions that don't require imaging, some scenarios still require it. The Microsoft Deployment Toolkit is an on-premises solution for creating images, and can also be used to deploy the OS to devices, either as a stand-alone tool, or used with Configuration Manager. Administrators can deploy using the default image, along with application and driver packages. MDT can also be used to create a custom image with OS configurations and applications in the image itself. While MDT is used for deployments, it isn't a tool for day-to-day client management.
