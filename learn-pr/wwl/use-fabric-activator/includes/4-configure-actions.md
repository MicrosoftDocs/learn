Actions are what happens when your rule conditions are met. They complete your Activator setup, turning condition evaluation into notifications and automated workflows. Activator offers four types of actions.

### Email actions

Email actions send detailed information that people can review and respond to within hours or days. Use email when the recipient needs comprehensive context or when immediate response isn't critical.

### Teams actions

Teams actions send immediate messages to channels or individuals. Use Teams when you need quick responses and team coordination. Teams notifications appear immediately and let teams discuss and coordinate their response.

### Power Automate actions

Power Automate is Microsoft's workflow automation service that connects different apps and services together. Power Automate actions execute multi-step business processes across different systems - automatically performing a series of tasks that would normally require manual steps across multiple applications.

### Fabric item actions

Fabric item actions execute data pipelines or notebooks for other processing and analysis. Use Fabric items when you need to process more data or perform advanced analysis in response to evaluated conditions.

With data sources connected, rules defined, and actions configured, you have everything needed for Activator to automatically take action when conditions occur in your streaming data.
