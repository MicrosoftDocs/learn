  - content: "In addition to having DC/DNS servers, what are the three required technologies needed before deploying Always On VPN?"
    choices:
    - content: "Active Directory Certificate (AD CS), a Certificate Authority (CA) server, and a Remote Access (Routing/VPN) server"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. These items aren't the three required technologies that are needed before deploying Always On VPN. Try again."

      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. These items aren't the three required technologies that are needed before deploying Always On VPN. Try again."
    - content: "Network Policy Server (NPS) (RADIUS), a Certificate Authority (CA) server, and a Remote Access (Routing/VPN) server"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Install NPS, or if NPS is already on the servers on the network, modify existing NPS server configuration rather than add a new server. Once the infrastructure is set up, you must enroll clients and then connect the clients to on-premises securely through several network changes."
  - content: "Which three tools are primarily used to deploy and manage the Always On VPN feature?"
    choices:
    - content: "Configuration Manager, Microsoft Intune or PowerShell"

    - content: "Configuration Manager, Microsoft Intune, XML VPN Profile"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. These items aren't the three technologies that are primarily used to deploy and manage the Always On VPN feature. Try again."
    - content: "Configuration Manager, Microsoft Intune, DirectAccess"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. These items aren't the three technologies that are primarily used to deploy and manage the Always On VPN feature. Try again."
