Organizations frequently require devices use a virtual private network (VPN) to access certain resources. While clients can be configured for user to initiate a VPN connection, the Always On VPN solution simplifies this process. When a user tried to access a resource requiring a VPN connection, Always On VPN seemlessly connects to the organizational network, without requiring separate actions by the user.

Always ON VPN is a feature of Windows Server, and can be deployed by setting up the necessary roles and services, including the NPS server, a Certificate authority server, and a Remote Access server.
