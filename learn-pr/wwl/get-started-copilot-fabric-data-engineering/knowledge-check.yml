  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "What is a primary benefit of using Copilot in Microsoft Fabric?"
    choices:
    - content: "It automates all data engineering tasks without user input."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Sorry, that's incorrect. Copilot assists but doesn't fully automate all tasks."
    - content: "It replaces the need for any data engineering expertise."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Sorry, that's incorrect. User expertise is still essential."
    - content: "It helps users create, transform, and analyze data using natural language."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Copilot uses natural language to assist with data tasks."
  - content: "Which feature of Dataflow Gen2 makes it easier for users to transform data?"
    choices:
    - content: "A command-line interface for scripting transformations."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Sorry, that's incorrect. Dataflow Gen2 uses a visual interface."
    - content: "Manual editing of raw data files only."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Sorry, that's incorrect. Dataflow Gen2 provides more than manual editing."

    - content: "Delete all data in the workspace automatically."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Sorry, that's incorrect. Copilot doesn't delete all data automatically."
  - content: "What is a key advantage of using Copilot in Fabric Notebooks?"
    choices:
    - content: "It only provides documentation, not code or analysis."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Sorry, that's incorrect. Copilot provides more than documentation."
    - content: "It generates code and helps with data analysis using magic commands and chat."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Copilot assists with code generation and analysis in notebooks."
    - content: "It restricts users to only one programming language."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Sorry, that's incorrect. Copilot supports multiple languages in notebooks."
