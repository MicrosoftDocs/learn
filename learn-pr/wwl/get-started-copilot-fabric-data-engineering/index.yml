title: Get started with Copilot in Microsoft Fabric for data engineering
summary: "Accelerate data engineering in Fabric with Copilot—apply AI prompts to ingest, transform, orchestrate, and explain dataflows, pipelines, and Spark code."
abstract: |
  In this module, you learn how to:
    - Apply Copilot across Microsoft Fabric to accelerate end‑to‑end data engineering tasks from ingestion to transformation and exploration.
    - Prompt Copilot to create and configure dataflows and pipelines with natural language instead of manual UI steps.
    - Generate, refine, and explain data transformation logic and Spark code safely and efficiently.
    - Use effective prompting strategies and best practices to improve quality, performance, and governance when using Copilot in Fabric.
prerequisites: |
  You should be familiar with data analytics and engineering concepts and terminology.
