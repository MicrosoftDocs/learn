Microsoft Fabric is an integrated platform designed to streamline data integration, engineering, and analytics. A key feature of Fabric is Copilot, an AI-powered assistant that enhances productivity by assisting users in creating, transforming, and analyzing data. Copilot uses natural language processing to facilitate tasks across various components of Microsoft Fabric, including Data Factory and Data Engineering.

In this module, we'll explore how Contoso Health, a multi-specialty hospital network, can utilize Microsoft Fabric and Copilot to manage and analyze their diverse datasets. By using Copilot's capabilities, Contoso Health can efficiently process data from Electronic Health Records (EHR), medical imaging, billing systems, patient feedback, and operational metrics to gain actionable insights.

There's various ways Contoso Health can ingest and transform data in Microsoft Fabric. 

- With **Dataflow Gen 2**, you can transform data using 300+ data transformation options, and write the results into multiple destinations with an easy to use, highly visual user interface. We'll explore how Copilot can make the process of creating a dataflow easier and faster.
  
- The copy activity as part of a **Fabric Data Pipeline** is the best low-code and no-code choice to move large quantities of data to lakehouses and warehouses from varieties of sources, either ad-hoc or via a schedule. Copilot can help you create a pipeline, just using natural language. 
  
- Develop the code to extract and transform data with a **Spark Notebook**. Spark provides a distributed computing platform that can process large amounts of data in parallel. Code is typically written in Python, Scala, or R. Copilot can assist you with writing the code.
