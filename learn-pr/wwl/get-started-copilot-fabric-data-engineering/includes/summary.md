In this module, we explored how Copilot in Microsoft Fabric enhances productivity by assisting you in creating, transforming, and analyzing data. We covered how to use Copilot to create a data pipeline, transform data using dataflow gen2, and analyze it using natural language queries. We also discussed how Copilot can help you generate code snippets in notebooks.

Remember, Copilot is here to assist you, not replace you. Your expertise is crucial for understanding the data, and Copilot helps you uncover new insights while saving time on simpler, repetitive tasks.
