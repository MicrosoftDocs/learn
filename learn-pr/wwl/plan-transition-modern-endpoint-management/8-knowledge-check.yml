  questions:
  - content: "Wingtip Toys is a small wholesaler specializing in children's toys and games. As the Desktop Administrator, Alan Deyoung has successfully migrated all client devices from older operating system versions to Windows 11. Alan is now deciding what method of client management the company should employ. As part of that process, Alan has analyzed its existing IT environment and come to the following conclusions: Wingtip's applications are modern and relatively simple installs. The OS configuration capabilities provided by Autopilot meet its deployment needs. It doesn't have an excessive number of existing legacy applications. Its existing configuration management deployment is relatively simple. Based on these findings, what method of client management should Alan recommend?"
    choices:
    - content: "Moving completely to cloud-based management using Intune"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Smaller organizations should consider moving to 100% cloud-based management using Intune if: The OS configuration capabilities provided by Autopilot meet deployment needs. Applications are modern and relatively simple installs. There isn't an excessive number of existing legacy applications. The existing configuration management deployment is relatively simple. Server management requirements can be accomplished with other tools such as Windows Admin Center."
    - content: "Use Configuration Manager"

  - content: "Northwind Traders wants its Azure AD users to securely synchronize their user settings and application settings data to the cloud. By doing so, Northwind's users have a unified experience across their Windows devices, and the time needed for configuring a new device will be reduced.

    choices:
    - content: "Enterprise State Roaming (ESR)"

    - content: "User State Migration Tool (USMT)"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The USMT is typically used when synchronization solutions aren't enough and there's a need to migrate files or settings from one device to another in Windows environments. Try again."
    - content: "Configuration Manager"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Configuration Manager can be used to create and integrate a USMT package. Try again."
