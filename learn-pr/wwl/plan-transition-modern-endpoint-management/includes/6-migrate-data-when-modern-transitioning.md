When moving a user to a new device or performing an in-place migration, it's important to think about which user and app settings should be kept and how to make sure this information is saved.

### Synchronize the user state

Starting with Windows 10, Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) users gain the ability to securely synchronize their user settings and application settings data to the cloud. Enterprise State Roaming (ESR) provides users with a unified experience across their Windows devices and reduces the time needed for configuring a new device. Enterprise State Roaming operates similar to the standard consumer settings sync that was first introduced in Windows 8.

Enterprise State Roaming also offers:

 -  **Separation of corporate and consumer data**. Organizations possess complete control over their data, guaranteeing that there's no commingling of corporate data within a consumer cloud account or consumer data within an enterprise cloud account.
 -  **Enhanced security**. Data is automatically encrypted before leaving the user’s Windows device by using Azure Rights Management (Azure RMS), and data stays encrypted at rest in the cloud. All content stays encrypted at rest in the cloud, except for the namespaces, like settings names and Windows app names.
 -  **Better management and monitoring**. Provides control and visibility over who syncs settings in your organization and on which devices through the Azure AD portal integration.

ESR (Enterprise State Roaming) facilitates the synchronization of settings across Azure AD joined devices. When ESR is enabled in an organization, users simply need to sign in to a new device, and the device will automatically retain all the supported settings. These include Microsoft Edge browser settings, personalized configurations, passwords, language preferences, mouse settings, and even certain UWP Apps (if supported by the developer).

As a general guideline, it's advisable to migrate all the settings and data that users require, while avoiding the migration of unnecessary and outdated data that only takes up storage space. Additionally, it's essential to consider the effort required to migrate specific data versus the time saved.

ESR (Enterprise State Roaming) doesn't synchronize settings for desktop applications. The impact of this limitation depends on various factors. Although many applications store data in the AppData folder, often this data is generated by the app as part of its regular operations, and it may not be critical or unique data that users would consider lost if it weren't migrated.

Sometimes the user data is easier to create. For example, perhaps the user that launches a fresh installed app might have to set up something simple such as their name in the app.

It's important not to overlook simple configurations that can have a significant impact. Even if a configuration step seems straightforward, such as setting a folder location within an application, it may not be wise to assume that users will correctly configure it on their own. Relying on users to perform multiple post-migration configurations, even if they're simple, can potentially lead to issues and complications. Therefore, it's recommended to consider the potential challenges and problems that may arise from relying solely on user-initiated configurations after migration.

### Migrate the user state

When synchronization solutions aren't enough and there's a need to migrate files or settings from one device to another in Windows environments, the User State Migration Tool (USMT) is typically used. USMT isn't so much a user state synchronization tool as a means to migrate the user state during upgrades and migrations. User state migration has two phases:

1.  **Capture settings**. You begin by capturing settings and data from the source computer. You store these settings in a migration store, which is often on a shared network folder, although it could also be on local storage.
2.  **Restore captured settings**. After capturing the settings and data from the source computer, you must restore them on the destination computer. You can perform the second phase only after you install an operating system on the destination computer, and it can occur separately or during the operating-system installation.

Usually, all the settings and data that were captured on the source computer are later restored, but this isn't necessarily the case. You could capture some settings or data and decide later not to restore them. However, you should be aware that you can’t restore data that you didn't first capture, because it doesn't exist in the migration store.

### User state migration in the replace and refresh computer scenario

User state migration can occur in different deployment stages, depending on whether you use a wipe-and-load (refresh) or side-by-side (replace) deployment scenario.

 -  **In the replace scenario, the source and destination computers are different**. When deploying Windows on new computers, you can capture the user state from source computers before or after you deploy Windows on destination computers. After Windows deploys on destination computers, you can restore the user states on these computers.
 -  **In the refresh scenario, the source and destination computers are the same**. When upgrading to the Windows 10 or Windows 11 operating system on computers that have existing operating systems, you can capture the user state, store it in temporary storage, perform a clean Windows installation, and then restore the user state on the upgraded computers.

When you deploy Windows on a computer that has an existing, supported Windows operating system, Windows creates a Windows.old folder. You can migrate user settings from that folder. Windows enables nondestructive deployment because a Windows installation doesn't wipe out the target partition. The previous Windows installation folder, the Program Files folder, and the Users folder are moved to the Windows.old folder, whereas user data in the root folder remains unchanged. You can capture user state either online, while an older version of Windows is running, or offline, from the Windows.old folder.

### Known Folder Move to facilitate a modern file management solution

OneDrive allows users to seamlessly store and synchronize data between the cloud and the devices they use. Users can create, open, and edit files without impacting their existing workflows while OneDrive synchronizes those changes in the background. Users can access their files from any device using their Microsoft account.

Historically, it's the user's responsibly to set this up. Known Folder Move enables IT to facilitate OneDrive to begin protecting the commonly used Desktop, Pictures, and Documents folders.

Enabling Known Folder Move is done through Group Policy. You'll need to install the Group Policy templates, which are located at **%localappdata%\\Microsoft\\OneDrive\[BuildNumber\]\\adm** of a OneDrive client. You'll need to enable the **Prompt users to move Windows known folders to OneDrive** policy and configure it with your tenant ID (located in Azure AD admin center).

If a user is already using OneDrive to redirect their folders to another account (such as a personal account), they'll be prompted to direct the folders to the organizational account.

Alternatively, you can also configure this to occur without any user interaction. Enabling the **Silently move Windows known folders to OneDrive** group policy with your tenant ID if you don't wish to prompt users to migrate folders to OneDrive. You can also decide whether to show a notification when folders have been redirected.

There are some considerations to consider when choosing to use Known Folder Move:

 -  You can’t use KFM if you're using Windows Folder Redirection for Desktop, Pictures, or Documents folders.
 -  Consider configuring the sync client upload rate GPO if you have a large organization or expect KFM to result in a large amount of data being migrated. Also consider a pilot group to assess potential impact to network traffic.
 -  KFM will return errors if unsupported conditions are found. These can include unsupported file types (such as Outlook or OneNote files), exceeding maximum path length and known folders not in the default locations.

Utilizing OneDrive Known Folders compliments ESR and allows the ability to manage Win32 application settings without the need for legacy roaming profiles.

### Integrate USMT with Configuration Manager

To migrate settings from one device to another or retain settings on the same device during a rebuild process also known as a **Hardlink migration store**, you can utilize USMT (User State Migration Tool) on a single device. Configuration Manager offers several components of USMT that can be used for this purpose. In this section, we'll explore some of the available options and provide an example of how you can effectively utilize USMT in real-world scenarios.

After setting up the Configuration Manager site, one prerequisite of the Windows ADK is the installation of the User State migration components. This enables Configuration Manager to create and integrate a USMT package. Below outlines at a high level the key components involved.

#### Create a USMT Package from Configuration Manager

After installing the prerequisites, you can either create a custom USMT package or use the default package to manage the capture and reinstatement of data. Typically, you'll copy the default package and then replicate it to include the changes related to the use scenario. You can use either package in the process.

The default package is located on the Configuration Manager site server under:

%Program files%\\Windows Kits\\10\\Assessment and Deployment Kit\\User State Migration

#### Set up a State Migration Point (Configuration Manager Site System Role)

To support multiple migrations of user data during an upgrade, you can assemble a State Migration Point (Configuration Manager Role) to act as a file share to store data. Each request stores a unique hash relating to the device that allows data to be captured (through a computer association), the device upgraded, and the relevant data reinstated afterwards. For large enterprises, it's common to have regionally located State Migration Points within the site hierarchy.

#### Task sequence

Task sequences play a crucial role in managing the entire OS deployment process, allowing you to incorporate USMT when necessary. USMT is utilized at the initial stage of the process to capture user settings, and it can also be used as a post-build step to restore those settings for specific users based on the chosen options. The USMT package, created during site setup, is then referenced within the task sequence steps to enable this functionality.

#### USMT templates used for migration

USMT templates consist of four .xml templates that control data, which is collected. These files are:

 -  MigApp.xml
 -  MigDocs.xml
 -  MigUser.xml
 -  ConfigMgr.xml

These four files provide the means to customize the data collection process for a user's profile. By creating custom versions of these files, you can specify which specific data you want to collect, while still adhering to the XML template structure. These files are executed within either the Scan or Load module and are referenced in the Configuration Manager task sequence step.
