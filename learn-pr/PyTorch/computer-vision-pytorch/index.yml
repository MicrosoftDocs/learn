title: Introduction to Computer Vision with PyTorch 
summary:   In this module you will get an introduction to Computer Vision using one of the most popular deep learning frameworks, PyTorch! We will use image classification tasks to learn about convolutional neural networks, and then learn how pre-trained networks and transfer learning can improve our models and solve real-world problems.
