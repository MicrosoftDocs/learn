You can use Visual Studio Code for the Web, also known as vscode.dev, to quickly browse repositories and make lightweight code changes. Visual Studio Code for the Web is free, doesn't require any installation, and has many of the same features of VS Code Desktop that you're familiar with.

## Scenario - code from any device

Suppose you are a developer at a startup. You work on a small team of developers that rely on timely reviews of pull requests to quickly ship changes. You're often on-the-go and need to be able to perform simple coding tasks from any device, including your phone or tablet.

## What will I learn?

In this module, you'll learn how to:

- Navigate Visual Studio Code for the Web to browse code and make lightweight changes. 
- Understand the different use cases for VS Code for the Web and Visual Studio Code Desktop. 
- Use the Remote Repositories extension to open a repository, make changes, and use source control features. 
- Continue working in a different environment, so you can seamlessly move from the lightweight browser-based editor to the full-featured desktop application.

By the end of this module, you'll be able to browse, edit, and review code on any device using Visual Studio for the Web.
