quiz:
  questions:
  - content: "Suppose you work for a company that manages a code repository on GitHub. Programmers are required to commit code regularly to this repository. Which feature of Visual Studio Code helps you meet this requirement?"
    choices:
    - content: "This feature isn't supported by Visual Studio Code."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Visual Studio Code has built-in support for Git."
    - content: "You can install a code-formatting extension for Visual Studio Code."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "A code-formatting extension does not provide integration with source control management systems."
    - content: "You can use the built-in source control feature of Visual Studio Code."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Visual Studio Code has built-in support for Git."
    
  - content: "Suppose you're developing an Android app. Should you use Visual Studio Code?"
    choices:
    - content: "Yes. Visual Studio Code supports Android development out-of-the-box."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "You would need to install extensions to provide Android support in Visual Studio Code."
    - content: "Maybe. You can install extensions to support Android development in Visual Studio Code. However, a better choice might be the official Android IDE."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "In some cases, you may prefer to use the official IDE for a particular language or platform such as Android instead of Visual Studio Code."
  - content: "Suppose your team is planning to develop applications in Rust. How would you determine if Visual Studio Code can support this programming language?"
    choices:
    - content: "You search the Extensions Marketplace to determine if there are Rust extensions."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "You can search the Extensions Marketplace for extensions that support hundreds of languages, including Rust."
    - content: "You determine Visual Studio Code won't support your team's need because Visual Studio Code is a lightweight editor that supports only a few languages."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "You can search the Extensions Marketplace for extensions that support hundreds of languages, including Rust. More extensions are being developed and added all the time."
