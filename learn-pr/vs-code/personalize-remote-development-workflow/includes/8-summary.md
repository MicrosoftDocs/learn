The goal of this module was to help you evaluate options for customizing your remote development experience in VS Code. You examined the following features:

- Create profiles for different languages, frameworks, and environments. You learned how to export profiles for sharing with others and how to import them into VS Code.
- Use Settings Sync to sync your settings across multiple machines. You now know how to turn on the feature, how to check sync status, how to view what data is synced, and how to manage that data.
- Combine remote environments to fit your needs.

You can use these features to create a personalized and consistent remote development experience in VS Code.
