With the Visual Studio Code (VS Code) remote extensions, you can connect to and develop on remote machines without having to leave VS Code. You can work on multiple projects in these remote environments. You might even have multiple remote environments that you need to connect to.

It's important to know how to customize VS Code for any project or environment so that you can be more productive and focused with only the settings and extensions that you need.

## Scenario: Working at an agency

Suppose that you work at an agency that does web development projects for large clients. As a developer at this agency, you work in several languages and frameworks. The agency standardized on Docker containers for development environments. These Docker environments make it easier for developers to jump in and out of projects without having to configure their machines for every project that they work on.

The agency has a customer who wants all work to be done on the customer's virtual machines (VMs). The customer set up a specific environment for the agency on these VMs. This environment mimics the customer's production environment. The customer has security concerns and wants to make sure that all code stays on these VMs.

As a developer at this agency, you often need to contribute to projects both in Docker containers and on remote VMs. You use VS Code on multiple machines. When it's convenient, you also use VS Code from the browser. You're looking for a way to manage your VS Code settings in a central place to make it easier to switch between instances and environments where you use VS Code.

## What will we be doing?

In this module, you'll:

- Turn on and configure Settings Sync in VS Code.
- Load a personalized version of VS Code both locally and on the web.
- Create profiles that are tailored for various projects and remote environments.
- Combine multiple remote development environments for a customized development experience.

## What is the main goal?

By the end of this module, you'll have the knowledge to set up and synchronize customized VS Code configurations for multiple projects and environments.
