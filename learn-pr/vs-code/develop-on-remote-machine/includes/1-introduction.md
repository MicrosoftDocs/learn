You can use the [Visual Studio Code (VS Code) Remote - SSH extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-ssh) to open a remote folder on any remote machine with a running SSH server and use VS Code's full feature set.

## Scenario - need for a consistent development environment

Suppose you work at an agency that has several different applications in various languages and frameworks. Applications should be developed on the same operating system where they are deployed, which is different than your local machine's operating system. Developers also need to easily run and debug the different applications, without needing to have each application's source files downloaded locally or the right tools and dependencies installed on their own machines. Ideally, all developers work in the same development environment for consistency, reducing time spent troubleshooting environment configuration issues.

## What will I learn?

In this module, you'll learn how to:

- Access a remote machine using the VS Code Remote - SSH extension. By accessing a remote machine, you can quickly swap between different, remote development environments.
- Set up and connect to a remote machine, so you can develop on the same operating system you deploy to.
- Run and debug your code while connected to the remote machine, so you can safely make updates without worrying about impacting your local machine.

By the end of this module, you'll be able to connect to any project located on a remote machine using SSH.
