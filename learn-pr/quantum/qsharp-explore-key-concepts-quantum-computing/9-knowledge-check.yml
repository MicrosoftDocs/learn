  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:

  - content: 'Which of these statements is true about quantum computing.'
    choices:
    - content: 'A quantum computer uses superposition to calculate all outputs of an algorithm at once.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'Quantum computers do not calculate all outputs at once, but use superposition, interference, and entanglement to make more efficient algorithms.'
    - content: 'A quantum computer is faster than classical computers for all tasks.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'Quantum computers provide an advantage only for certain tasks.'
    - content: 'A quantum computer exploits superposition, interference, and entanglement to do calculations faster than classical computers.'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: 'Learning how to exploit these phenomena is the key to designing better quantum algorithms.'
      
  - content: 'The probability amplitude of a qubit state is:'
    choices:
    - content: 'The probability of obtaining such qubit state when measuring the qubit.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'The probability of obtaining the qubit state is the absolute value of the probability amplitude squared.'
    - content: 'A complex number encoding the phase and the probability of obtaining such qubit state when measuring the qubit.'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: 'We can obtain the probability by squaring the absolute value of the probability amplitude.'
    - content: 'A complex number whose absolute value squared tells us the probability of the algorithm to succeed.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'Probability amplitudes are associated with quantum states rather than with algorithms.'

  - content: 'Qubit states behave similar to waves. Which of these statements is true about quantum interference:'
    choices:
    - content: 'Constructive interference occurs when two states of opposite phase superpose.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'Constructive interference occurs when we superpose two states of the same phase.'
    - content: 'Quantum interference is a phenomenon in which electromagnetic waves produce noise in our quantum computations.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'Quantum interference is not related with electromagnetic interference.'
    - content: 'We can exploit quantum interference to do calculations faster than with classical computers.'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: 'Quantum interference is one of the key ingredients to achieve efficient quantum algorithms.'

  - content: 'If two qubits are entangled:'
    choices:
    - content: 'Changing the state of one of the qubits directly changes the state of the other.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'Operations on one of the qubits do not modify the partial state of the other qubit.'
    - content: 'The outcomes of measurements over those qubits are strongly correlated.'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: 'Two qubits are entangled if measurements over the qubits present correlations that cannot be explained with classical physics alone.'
    - content: 'Both qubits give always the same results when we measure their individual state, no matter how we manipulate them.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'Two qubits can be entangled but be in different partial states and output different results when measure them.'
