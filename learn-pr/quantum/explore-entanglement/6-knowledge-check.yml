  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: What is the key feature of entangled qubits in quantum mechanics?
    choices:
    - content: The states of entangled qubits can't be described independently but only as a whole system. Thus, when you measure one qubit, it affects the state of the other qubit, no matter how far apart they are.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. When qubits are entangled, they share information.
    - content: Entangled qubits don't share any information.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. When qubits are entangled, information is shared between them.
    - content: The states of entangled qubits can be described independently. Thus, when you measure one qubit, it doesn't affect the state of the other qubit.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. When qubits are entangled, their states can' be described independently but only as a whole system.

  - content: What is the role of the CNOT operation in creating quantum entanglement?
    choices:
    - content: >-
        It flips the state of the second qubit (the target qubit) if, and only if, the state of the first qubit (the control qubit) is $\ket{1}$.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. The CNOT operation is a multiqubit operation that entangles two qubits by flipping the state of the target qubit based on the state of the control qubit.
    - content: It flips the state of both qubits regardless of their initial states.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: >-
        Incorrect. The CNOT operation only flips the state of the target qubit if the control qubit is in the state $\ket{1}$.
    - content: >-
        It flips the state of the first qubit (the control qubit) if and only if the state of the second qubit (the target qubit) is $\ket{1}$.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. The CNOT operation flips the state of the target qubit, not the control qubit, based on the state of the control qubit.

  - content: What is the role of classical communication in the quantum teleportation protocol?
    choices:
    - content: It allows the teleportation of information faster than the speed of light.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. The classical communication prevents the information to be teleported faster than the speed of light.
    - content: It's used to physically move the qubit from one location to another.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. In quantum teleportation, the qubit itself isn't physically moved, but the information about its state.
    - content: It's used by the sender to communicate the results of their measurements to the receiver. By doing so, the receiver can apply the necessary operations to the qubit they have to recreate the message qubit.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. The sender communicates the results of their measurements to the receiver using classical communication.
