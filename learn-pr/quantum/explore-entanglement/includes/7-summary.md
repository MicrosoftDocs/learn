Congratulations! In this module, you learned about the concept of quantum entanglement, and you use it to help Alice and Bob to send quantum information with Q# and the Azure Quantum Development Kit. 

The main takeaways from this module are:

- Two qubits are entangled when their states are correlated and **can't** be described **independently**. If you measure one qubit, you know the outcome of the other qubit without measuring it, because they're correlated. Some examples of entangled states include the Bell states.
- You can create entanglement using the **CNOT operation,** which transforms two qubits into a Bell state.
- Quantum teleportation uses entanglement to transfer the state of a qubit from one location to another without physically moving the qubit itself. In teleportation, qubits can be separated by large distances, but the protocol is limited by the classical communication between the sender and the receiver.

## Next steps

- Check out the [Quantum Katas](https://quantum.microsoft.com/tools/quantum-katas), hands-on tutorials that teach quantum computing concepts and the Q# programming language.
- Go to [Azure Quantum website](https://quantum.microsoft.com/tools/quantum-coding) and try Copilot in Azure Quantum, a tool that helps you write Q# programs.
- Learn more about quantum computing and Q# in the [Azure Quantum Development Kit documentation](/azure/quantum/).
