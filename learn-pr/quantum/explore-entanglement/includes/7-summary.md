Congratulations! In this module, you learned about the concept of quantum entanglement, and you used entanglement to help Alice and Bob to send quantum information through the teleportation protocol with Q# and the Azure Quantum Development Kit.

Here are the main takeaways from this module:

- Two qubits are entangled when their states are correlated and can't be described independently. If you measure one entangled qubit, then you know the state of the other qubit without measuring it because their states correlated. The Bell states are common examples of entangled states in quantum computing.
- You can create entanglement with the CNOT operation, which can transform two qubits into a Bell state.
- Quantum teleportation uses entanglement to transfer the state of a qubit from one location to another without physically moving the qubit itself. In teleportation, qubits can be separated by large distances, but the speed of the protocol is limited by the classical communication between the sender and the receiver.

## Next steps

- Check out the [Quantum Katas](https://quantum.microsoft.com/tools/quantum-katas), hands-on tutorials that teach quantum computing concepts and the Q# programming language.
- Go to the [Microsoft Quantum website](https://quantum.microsoft.com/tools/quantum-coding) and try Copilot in Microsoft Quantum, a tool that helps you write Q# programs.
- Learn more about quantum computing and Q# in the [Azure Quantum documentation](/azure/quantum/).
