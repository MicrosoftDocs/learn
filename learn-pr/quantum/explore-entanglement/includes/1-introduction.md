Entanglement is a quantum phenomenon where the the states of different qubits depend on each other in such a way that the individual qubits can't be described independently. Quantum entanglement is a fundamental concept and a powerful tool in quantum computing.

In this module, you write Q# code to create and manipulate entangled qubits. You transfer the state of a qubit from one location to another without physically moving the qubit itself. This process is known as quantum teleportation. To perform the teleportation, you use operations like Controlled-NOT (CNOT), Hadamard (H), and Pauli X and Z to create entangled Bell states.

By the end of this module, you can:

- Describe the concept of quantum entanglement.
- Understand the quantum teleportation protocol.
- Apply single-qubit and multi-qubit operations in Q#.
- Create and manipulate entangled qubits in Q#.

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of quantum computing concepts.
- Knowledge of linear algebra and Dirac notation.
- The latest version of [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).
- The latest version of the [Microsoft Quantum Development Kit](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=quantum.qsharp-lang-vscode) extension. Or, open [VS Code for the Web](https://vscode.dev/quantum), which already includes the Quantum Development Kit extension.

## Recommended learning

To get the most out of this module, first complete the [Explore quantum superposition with Q#](xref:learn.quantum.explore-superposition) module. The superposition module introduces the basic concepts of Dirac notation, qubit states, and quantum gates.
