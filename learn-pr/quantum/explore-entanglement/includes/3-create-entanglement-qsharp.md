In the previous unit, you learned about the concept of quantum entanglement and Bell states.

Now, let's create quantum entanglement using Q# and the Azure Quantum Development Kit. To create entanglement, you need to apply two quantum operations: the Hadamard operation and the Controlled-NOT (CNOT) operation.

First, let's understand how these operations work and how they create entanglement.

## The Controlled-NOT (CNOT) operation

When two qubits are entangled, the state of one qubit is dependent on the state of the other qubit. Therefore, to entangle two qubits you need an operation that acts on both qubits at the same time. This is called a *multiqubit operation*.

To create quantum entanglement, you need the multiqubit `CNOT` operation, which stands for *Controlled-NOT*. This operation takes two qubits as input, one acts as control qubit and the other is the target qubit. The `CNOT` operation flips the state of the second qubit (the target qubit) if, and only if, the state of the first qubit (the control qubit) is $|1\rangle$. 

|Input|Output|
|-|-|
|$\ket{00}$|$\ket{00}$|
|$\ket{01}$|$\ket{01}$|
|$\ket{10}$|$\ket{11}$|
|$\ket{11}$|$\ket{10}$|

In Q#, the `CNOT` operation acts on an array of two qubits, and it flips the second qubit if the first qubit is `One`.

## Entanglement with Hadamard and CNOT operations

By applying the **Hadamard**, `H`, operation and the **Controlled-NOT**, `CNOT`, operation, you can transform two qubits in the state $|00\rangle$ to the Bell state $\ket{\phi^+}=\frac1{\sqrt2}(|00\rangle+|11\rangle)$.

Here's how it works:

1. Take two qubits in the state $|00\rangle$. The first qubit is the control qubit and the second qubit is the target qubit.
1. Create a superposition state only in the control qubit by applying $H$.

   $$H |0_c\rangle= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0_c\rangle+|1_c\rangle)$$

   > [!TIP]
   > The subscripts ${}_c$ and ${}_t$ specify the control and target qubits.

1. Apply the $CNOT$ operator to the control qubit, which is in a superposition state, and the target qubit, which is in the state $|0_t\rangle$.

    $$ CNOT \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\ket{0_c}+\ket{1_c})\ket{0}_t = CNOT \frac{1}{\sqrt2}(\ket{0_c 0_t}+|\ket{1_c 0_t})= $$
    $$ =\frac{1}{\sqrt2}(CNOT \ket{0_c 0_t} + CNOT \ket{1_c 0_t})= $$
    $$= \frac{1}{\sqrt2}(\ket{0_c 0_t}+\ket{1_c 1_t})$$

## Create quantum entanglement in Q#

You start by creating a new Q# file in Visual Studio Code.

1. Open Visual Studio Code.
1. Select **File > New Text File** and save it as **Main.qs**.
1. Select **View -> Command Palette** and type **Q#: Set the Azure Quantum QIR target profile**. Press **Enter**.
1. Select **Q#: Unrestricted**.

### Create the Bell state $\ket{\phi^+}$

Let's start by creating the Bell state $\ket{\phi^+}=\frac1{\sqrt2}(|00\rangle+|11\rangle)$. 

1. First, you need to import the `Microsoft.Quantum.Diagnostics` namespace from the Standard library, which contains the `DumpMachine` function. This function shows the current state of the qubits. Copy and paste the following Q# code into **Main.qs** file. 

    ```qsharp
    import Microsoft.Quantum.Diagnostics.*; // Aka Std.Diagnostics.*;
    ```

    > [!TIP]
    > You can also import the Standard library by substituting `Microsoft.Quantum` with `Std`. For example, `import Std.Diagnostics.*` is equivalent to `import Microsoft.Quantum.Diagnostics.*`.

1. Create the `Main` operation that returns two `Result` type values, which are the measurement results of the qubits. 

    ```qsharp
    import Microsoft.Quantum.Diagnostics.*; // Aka Std.Diagnostics.*;

    operation Main() : (Result, Result) {
        // Your code goes here
    }
    ```

1. Inside the `Main` operation, you allocate two qubits, `q1` and `q2`, that will be entangled. 

    ```qsharp
    import Microsoft.Quantum.Diagnostics.*; // Aka Std.Diagnostics.*;

    operation Main() : (Result, Result) {
        use (q1, q2) = (Qubit(), Qubit());
    }
    ```

1. Apply the Hadamard gate, `H`, to the first qubit, `q1`, to put it in a superposition state. Then, entangle the two qubits using the `CNOT` operation.

    ```qsharp
    import Microsoft.Quantum.Diagnostics.*; // Aka Std.Diagnostics.*;

    operation Main() : (Result, Result) {
        use (q1, q2) = (Qubit(), Qubit());

        H(q1);
        CNOT(q1, q2);
    }
    ```

1. Use the `DumpMachine` function to display the current state of the qubits. This is **not** the same as measuring the qubits.

    ```qsharp
    import Microsoft.Quantum.Diagnostics.*; // Aka Std.Diagnostics.*;

    operation Main() : (Result, Result) {
        use (q1, q2) = (Qubit(), Qubit());

        H(q1);
        CNOT(q1, q2);

        DumpMachine();
    }
    ```

1. Measure the qubits using the `M` operation and store the results in `m1` and `m2`. Then, use the `Reset` operation to reset the qubits. In Q#, you must always reset the qubits to the $|0\rangle$ state.

    ```qsharp
    import Microsoft.Quantum.Diagnostics.*; // Aka Std.Diagnostics.*;

    operation Main() : (Result, Result) {

        use (q1, q2) = (Qubit(), Qubit());

        H(q1);
        CNOT(q1, q2);
        DumpMachine();

        let (m1, m2) = (M(q1), M(q2));
        Reset(q1);
        Reset(q2);

    }
    ```

1. Finally, return the measurement results of the qubits with the `return` statement. Your **Main.qs** file should look like this:

    ```qsharp
    import Microsoft.Quantum.Diagnostics.*; // Aka Std.Diagnostics.*;

    operation Main() : (Result, Result) {
        use (q1, q2) = (Qubit(), Qubit());

        H(q1);
        CNOT(q1, q2);

        DumpMachine();

        let (m1, m2) = (M(q1), M(q2));
        Reset(q1);
        Reset(q2);

        return (m1, m2);
    }
    ```

1. To run your program on the built-in simulator, click on **Run** above the `Main` operation or press **Ctrl+F5**. Your output will appear in the debug console.
1. The measurement outcomes are correlated, so at the end of the program, you get a result of `(Zero, Zero)` or `(One, One)` with equal probability.
1. You can visualize the circuit diagram by clicking on **Circuit** from the list of commands above the `Main` operation. The circuit diagram shows the Hadamard gate applied to the first qubit and the CNOT gate applied to both qubits.

## How to create other Bell states

To create other Bell states, you need to apply additional Pauli $X$ and $Z$ operations to the qubits.

For example, to create the Bell state $\ket{\phi^-}=\frac1{\sqrt2}(|00\rangle-|11\rangle)$, you can apply the Pauli $Z$ operation to the control qubit after applying the Hadamard gate. The $Z$ operation flips the state $\ket{+}$ to $\ket{-}$.

> [!TIP]
> The states $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0\rangle+|1\rangle)$ and $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0\rangle -|1\rangle)$ are also known as $\ket{+}$ and $\ket{-}$, respectively.

Here's how it works:

1. Take two qubits in the state $|00\rangle$. 
1. Create a superposition state only in the control qubit by applying $H$.

   $$H |0_c\rangle= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0_c\rangle+|1_c\rangle) = \ket{+}_c$$

1. Apply the $Z$ operation to the control qubit.

    $$Z \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0_c\rangle+|1_c\rangle)= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0_c\rangle-|1_c\rangle)= \ket{-}_c$$

1. Apply the $CNOT$ operator to the control qubit and the target qubit, which is in the state $|0_t\rangle$.

    $$ CNOT \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\ket{0_c}-\ket{1_c})\ket{0}_t = CNOT \frac{1}{\sqrt2}(\ket{0_c 0_t}-|\ket{1_c 0_t})= $$
    $$ =\frac{1}{\sqrt2}(CNOT \ket{0_c 0_t} - CNOT \ket{1_c 0_t})= $$
    $$= \frac{1}{\sqrt2}(\ket{0_c 0_t}-\ket{1_c 1_t})$$


Similarly, Bell states $\ket{\psi^+}$ and $\ket{\psi^-}$ can be created by applying the Pauli $X$ and $Z$ operations to the qubits.

- The Bell state $\ket{\psi^+}=\frac1{\sqrt2}(|01\rangle+|10\rangle)$ can be created by applying the Pauli $X$ operation to the target qubit after applying the Hadamard gate.
- The Bell state $\ket{\psi^-}=\frac1{\sqrt2}(|01\rangle-|10\rangle)$ can be created by applying the Pauli $Z$ to the control qubit and the Pauli $X$ to the target qubit after applying the Hadamard gate.

### Create the Bell state $\ket{\phi^-}$ in Q#

1. Modify the Q# code to create the Bell state $\ket{\phi^-}$. Your **Main.qs** file should look like this:

    ```qsharp
    import Microsoft.Quantum.Diagnostics.*; // Aka Std.Diagnostics.*;
    
    operation Main() : (Result, Result) {
        use (q1, q2) = (Qubit(), Qubit());
    
        H(q1);
        Z(q1); // Apply the Pauli Z operation to the control qubit
        CNOT(q1, q2);
    
        DumpMachine();
    
        let (m1, m2) = (M(q1), M(q2));
        Reset(q1);
        Reset(q2);

        return (m1, m2);
    }
    ```

1. To run your program on the built-in simulator, click on **Run** above the `Main` operation or press **Ctrl+F5**. Your output will appear in the debug console.
1. You can visualize the circuit diagram by clicking on **Circuit** from the list of commands above the `Main` operation. The circuit diagram shows the Hadamard gate applied to the first qubit, the Pauli $Z$ gate applied to the first qubit, and the CNOT gate applied to both qubits.

In the next unit, you'll learn how to use entanglement to send quantum information, a process known as quantum teleportation.
