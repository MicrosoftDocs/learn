Quantum computers work in fundamentally different ways from classical computers.
They can offer solutions when classical computers run into limitations. Quantum
algorithms aren't always faster than their classical counterparts. But for
certain tasks, such as factorizing large numbers or searching for items in an
unordered list, quantum computers provide important speed-ups. How
does it work? In this module, you'll learn the fundamental concepts behind the
power of quantum computing.

The key to understanding quantum computing is the three concepts: superposition,
interference, and entanglement. In this module, you'll use Q# and some tools
provided by the Quantum Development Kit to illustrate these ideas.

Finally, we'll outline different quantum algorithms to show how they exploit
superposition, interference, and entanglement to outperform classical computers.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you'll:

- Learn the basic theory behind the power of quantum computing: superposition,
  interference, and entanglement.
- Get a firsthand view of different tools in the Quantum Development Kit like
  the `DumpMachine` function, to inspect quantum states in virtual quantum
  computers, and the `ResourcesEstimator`, to estimate the quantum resources
  needed to run your programs.
- Learn about different algorithms that make use of quantum properties to
  outperform classical algorithms.
