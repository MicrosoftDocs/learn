  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:

  - content: 'Why is it important to estimate the resources required to run a quantum algorithm?'
    choices:
    - content: 'Quantum computers can run only a limited number of algorithms at a time, so you need to discard algorithms that require many resources.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "An algorithm doesn't have a unique resource consumption. The required resources depend on the technology of the quantum computer, so some technologies are more suitable for certain algorithms."
    - content: 'Quantum computers are an expensive technology, so you need to estimate how much an algorithm will cost to make the best economic decision.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The estimation of resources doesn't refer to monetary cost."
    - content: 'Resource estimation allows us to refine quantum solutions to run on future quantum computers by making choices about architectural design and QEC schemes.'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. With resource estimation, you can understand how many qubits you need, how long a quantum algorithm takes to run, and which qubit technologies are better to solve a specific problem."

  - content: 'The Microsoft Quantum resource estimator takes a physical qubit model, `qubitParams`, as a target parameter. Which of the following statements is true?'
    choices:
    - content: 'You can pick from six predefined qubit models, and each of their values can be updated. You can modify existing models and create new ones.'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: 'Correct. The resource estimator provides four gate-based and two Majorana-based qubit models. You can customize the models by specifying the name of the qubit model and updating any of the values.'
    - content: 'You can pick from two predefined qubit models, the surface code and the Floquet code.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'The resource estimator provides four gate-based and two Majorana-based qubit models. Surface and Floquet code are QEC codes.'
    - content: "You can pick from six predefined qubit models, but you can't customize their parameters."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'You can customize the predefined qubit models by specifying the name of the qubit model and updating any of the values.'
      
  - content: 'The resource estimator evaluates the resource estimates for a quantum algorithm. What is the output of the resource estimator?'
    choices:
    - content: 'The resource estimator outputs the estimated economic cost of running the algorithm and its runtime.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The resource estimator doesn't estimate how much money an algorithm would cost to run."
    - content: "The resource estimator outputs the number of physical qubits and the runtime of a quantum algorithm for each of the quantum hardware providers that are available in Azure Quantum."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The resource estimator doesn't compare quantum hardware providers."
    - content: "The resource estimator outputs physical and logical estimates, such as the number of rotation gates, number of qubits, QEC estimates, T factory parameters, and total runtime."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The resource estimator computes pre-layout and post-layout logical and physical estimations for a given qubit technology and error correction scheme."
