Congratulations! You've protected the space fleet against invaders by estimating the resources it would take to crack your passwords.

In this module, you learned:

- What resource estimation is.
- How to enable the Azure Quantum Resource Estimator in your workspace.
- How to submit a resource estimation job to Azure Quantum.
- How to customize the input parameters of a resource estimation job.
- How to estimate the resources of a quantum algorithm.
- How to compare different qubit technologies and architectures.

## Next steps

Now that you understand resource estimation, you can do experiments to deepen your knowledge:

- Try estimating the resources for a different Q# program.
- Explore how qubit parameters and QEC schemes affect the error correction code distance of the logical qubit.
- Use the output data to derive logical qubit properties.
- Use the table to experiment with other predefined qubit parameters or use your own customized version of qubit parameters.
