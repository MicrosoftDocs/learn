If you've studied earlier modules in the [Quantum computing foundations](/learn/paths/quantum-computing-fundamentals/?azure-portal=true) learning path, you're already familiar with the fundamentals of quantum computing and how quantum algorithms can solve some of the problems you and your crew have encountered on the spaceship.

In this learning path, one mission of your spaceship crew is an asteroid mining expedition. 

In this module, you'll learn about a *classical* computing method called quantum-inspired optimization (QIO). QIO refers to a class of algorithms that are applied to solve optimization problems on traditional hardware. 

To illustrate the QIO method, let's look at how the crew's logistics division efficiently loads cargo vessels.

Your spaceship is transporting a rare mineral you've mined from a recently discovered asteroid. However, two competing galactic federations have laid claim to the asteroid. To avoid a political crisis, the crew is tasked with delivering the mineral supply to the two federations in approximately equal amounts. 

To complicate the problem, the mineral supply has been extracted in massive chunks of varying sizes, so it's not easy to divide them equally. 

How can you optimize the distribution of the mineral and avert an intergalactic crisis?

## Learning objectives

In this module, you'll:

* Learn about the origins of quantum-inspired optimization.
* See which kinds of problems are best suited to this method.
* Understand how algorithms inspired by physical processes are used to solve difficult problems.
* Solve a combinatorial optimization problem by using the Azure Quantum optimization service.

## Prerequisites

* Any Python development environment
* The latest version of the [Python SDK for Azure Quantum](/azure/quantum/optimization-install-sdk?azure-portal=true)
* [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/install?azure-portal=true)
* An Azure Quantum workspace

If you don't have these tools yet, we recommend that you begin with the [Get started with Azure Quantum](/learn/modules/get-started-azure-quantum/?azure-portal=true) module.
