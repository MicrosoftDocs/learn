Phew, you've succeeded! 

Luckily, an intergalactic political crisis was averted, thanks to your clever use of a quantum-inspired optimization algorithm to equitably distribute the asteroid's rare mineral.

You now have a basic understanding of quantum-inspired optimization and some of the problems it can solve. Here's a brief recap:

* There are many types of quantum-inspired algorithms. One that's commonly used is based on a computational model called *adiabatic quantum computing*.
* Today, we can emulate adiabatic quantum algorithms by using quantum-inspired techniques on classical hardware.
* Quantum-inspired optimization works best with problems where the landscape is rugged, with many hills and valleys.
* Quantum-inspired optimization can be used in Azure Quantum to solve optimization problems.

## Get started with quantum programming with Q#

To begin writing quantum programs, check out [Create your first Q# program by using the Quantum Development Kit](/learn/modules/qsharp-create-first-quantum-development-kit/?azure-portal=true). There, you'll build a basic program that measures quantum bits (qubits) to generate random numbers.
