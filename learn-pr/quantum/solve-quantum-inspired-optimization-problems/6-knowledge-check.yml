quiz:
  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:

  - content: 'Which of these is a good candidate for applying quantum-inspired optimization (QIO)?'
    choices:
    - content: 'You need to find a solution faster than with other optimization techniques for a fixed use case and fixed quality of solution.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This answer is correct, but are others also good candidates?"
    - content: 'You need to find a higher quality solution than with other optimization techniques for a fixed problem and fixed amount of time.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This answer is correct, but are others also good candidates?"
    - content: 'You need to consider many variables to form a more realistic model.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This answer is correct, but are others also good candidates?"
    - content: 'All of the above.'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Applying QIO to real-world problems may offer businesses new insights or help lower costs by making their processes more efficient."

  - content: "The optimization landscape that's most ideal for QIO:"
    choices:
    - content: 'Is structured, but smooth.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'Although you could apply QIO here, QIO offers no advantages over other techniques.'
    - content: 'Is structured, but rugged.'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: 'QIO works best with problems where the landscape is rugged, with many hills and valleys.'
    - content: 'Is completely random.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'When the landscape is completely random, no algorithm can improve on a brute force search.'

  - content: "What's the difference between simulated annealing and quantum annealing?"
    choices:
    - content: 'Simulated annealing uses thermal jumps to overcome energy barriers. Quantum annealing uses quantum tunneling to travel through energy barriers.'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Simulated annealing is based on ideas from thermal physics; quantum annealing is a quantum algorithm."
    - content: 'Simulated annealing can discover only the local minimum of a cost function. Quantum annealing can discover the global minimum.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "You can use both methods to find the global minimum of a cost function."
    - content: "They're different names used to describe the same physical process."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "One of these methods is based on ideas from thermal physics; the other is a quantum algorithm."
