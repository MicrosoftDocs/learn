[Azure Quantum](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/quantum/) is the cloud quantum computing service of Azure. It offers a wide range of quantum hardware, software, and solutions in a single cloud service.

With Azure Quantum, you can write code once and run it with little to no change against multiple targets of the same family. Or, you can adapt the same algorithm for specific systems.

## What does Azure Quantum include?

With Azure Quantum and the Azure Quantum Development Kit (Modern QDK), you're able to program your quantum algorithms, then apply those quantum solutions within the existing Azure platform.

### Azure Quantum Development Kit

Quantum programming is a distinct art from classical programming that requires different tools to understand and express quantum algorithmic thinking. The Azure Quantum Development Kit (Modern QDK) is the software development kit required to interface with the Azure Quantum service. With the Quantum Development Kit, you can build programs that run on quantum hardware in Azure Quantum.

The Modern QDK includes Q#, a high-level **quantum programming language**. Q# is designed to address the challenges of quantum information processing. The Q# language is integrated in a software stack that enables a quantum algorithm to be compiled down to the primitive operations of a quantum computer.

The Modern QDK is the only development kit ready for Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computing (FTQC). With the Modern QDK, you can:

- **Debug your code:** It offers a quantum computing debugger that can step through classical and quantum code. This debugger paired with its sparse in-memory simulator, provides fast simulation of up to thousands of logical qubits.

- **Choose your platform:** The Modern QDK runs in your web browser with no installation necessary, and with its VS Code extension, it runs on your PC, Mac or Linux machine.

- **Write your code faster:** Syntax highlighting and intelligent code completion with IntelliSense and write entire blocks of code assisted with Copilot.

- **Run on your choice of hardware:** The QDK integrates seamlessly with Azure Quantum to run your algorithms on a wide range of quantum computers and simulators.

- **Design for FTQC:** The Modern QDK pairs with the state-of-the-art Azure Quantum Resource Estimator to provide a language designed specifically for quantum computing. Q# frees you from thinking about qubit architectures. It abstracts the hardware and allows you to mix classical and quantum computation, all performed by the quantum machine you're targeting.

### Hybrid quantum computing

Hybrid quantum computing is the mix of classical and quantum computing, both working together to solve a problem. With Azure Quantum, you can start coding for quantum computers by mixing up classical and quantum instructions. This means quantum programs can do more than just circuits. They can use classical programming methods to measure mid-circuit, optimize and reuse qubits, and adapt in real-time to the Quantum Processing Unit (QPU).

Azure Quantum also lets you batch multiple circuits into one job, which means you donâ€™t have to wait between job submissions, and you can run multiple jobs quicker. You can also manage your jobs easier by grouping jobs into sessions. Plus, jobs in sessions get priority over nonsession jobs.

### Resource estimation

In quantum computing, resource estimation is the ability to understand the resources required to run your algorithm, such as the number of qubits, the number of quantum gates, processing time, etc. When you understand the number of qubits required for a quantum solution and the differences between qubit technologies, you can prepare and refine your quantum solutions to run on future scaled quantum machines.

Azure Quantum provides a tool for estimating the resources of your quantum program. The Azure Quantum Resource Estimator allows you to assess architectural decisions, compare qubit technologies, and determine the resources needed to execute a given quantum algorithm. You can choose from predefined fault-tolerant protocols and specify assumptions of the underlying physical qubit model.

The Azure Quantum Resource Estimator takes a set of inputs such as qubit architecture, a quantum error correction (QEC) code, an error budget, and other parameters into account, and computes a post-layout physical resource estimation.

### Quantum hardware

In Azure Quantum, you can find various quantum hardware providers to help you get ready for the future of scaled quantum machines. Unlike other solutions, you're not siloed to a single hardware technology, and you benefit from a full stack approach protecting your long-term investments.

- **IonQ:** Dynamically reconfigurable trapped-ion quantum computers for up to 11 fully connected qubits. IonQ lets you run a two-qubit gate between any pair.
- **PASQAL**: Neutral atom-based quantum processors operating at room temperature, with long coherence times and impressive qubit connectivity.
- **Quantinuum:** Trapped-ion systems with high-fidelity, fully connected qubits, low error rates, qubit reuse, and the ability to perform mid-circuit measurements.
- **Rigetti:** Gate-based superconducting processors based on tunable qubits. Their latest Aspen-M family processor is based on proprietary scalable multi-chip technology, enabling low latency and parallel execution.

### Free Azure Quantum Credits

If it's your first time using Azure Quantum, you automatically get free **$500 (USD)** Azure Quantum Credits for use with each participating quantum hardware provider. That's right, you have $500 (USD) to spend at each of the quantum providers. The Azure Quantum Credits facilitate your exploration of the different quantum providers and help you test your first quantum programs.

Azure Quantum Credits consumption is based on a resource-usage model defined by each quantum provider and cost of use is deducted from your credits.

> [!NOTE]
> Note that Azure credits and Azure Quantum credits are different grants and shouldn't be confused. When you create a [free trial Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/), you get $200 (USD) free Azure Credits to use on Azure services. Azure credits aren't eligible to use on quantum hardware providers.

## Job lifecycle in Azure Quantum

Once you write your quantum program, you can select a target and submit your program, also called a job.

This diagram shows the basic workflow after you submit your job:

:::image type="content" source="../media/azure-quantum-flow-diagram.png" alt-text="Diagram showing the job lifecycle from the moment you submit your quantum problem, until the provider gets the program and returns the solution.":::

First, Azure Quantum uploads the job to the Azure Storage account that you configured in the workspace. Then, the job is added to the job queue for the provider that you specified in the job. Azure Quantum then downloads your program and translates it for the provider. The provider processes the job and returns the output to Azure Storage, where it's available for download.

## If I'm not a quantum expert, can I still use Azure Quantum?

Microsoft is committed to making quantum computing accessible to everyone, whether you're a quantum developer, researcher, or enthusiast.

Azure Quantum incorporates **artificial intelligence** to assist you. You can play with the Copilot in Azure Quantum, a quantum-focused chatbot that helps you write code and better understand quantum concepts.

If you want to learn by doing, try the *Quantum Katas*, a series of self-paced tutorials that teach you elements of quantum computing and Q# programming. You can also explore [the Q# quantum samples](https://github.com/microsoft/Quantum/tree/main/samples/azure-quantum).

You can also learn from experts and enthusiasts through blogs, articles and videos. And you can try out some Q# code samples in the online code editor.
