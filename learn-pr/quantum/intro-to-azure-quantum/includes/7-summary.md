Quantum computing could help us solve some of the greatest challenges of our time. In this module, you learned about the basic unit of quantum information, the qubit, and how it differs from a classical bit. You also learned the five DiVincenzo criteria to build a good quantum computer. Finally, you learned about some of the characteristics and applications of quantum computing.

Now that you know about the Azure Quantum service and what it offers, you know that it's possible to start your quantum computing journey today with Azure Quantum. Azure Quantum is an open, flexible, and future-proofed cloud ecosystem for quantum computing. Azure Quantum provides a diverse set of quantum computing solutions and technologies, such as:

- Access to diverse quantum hardware devices and simulators.
