Quantum computing could help us solve some of the greatest challenges of our time. In this module, you learned about the basic unit of quantum information, the qubit, and how it differs from a classical bit. You also learned the five DiVincenzo criteria to build a good quantum computer. Finally, you learned about some of the characteristics and applications of quantum computing.
