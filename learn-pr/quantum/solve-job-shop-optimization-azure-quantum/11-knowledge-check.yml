quiz:
  questions:
  - content: 'Which is the correct definition for the precedence constraint?'
    choices:
    - content: 'Each operation is started once and only once.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'Incorrect. This is the operation-once constraint.'
    - content: 'Jobs must take place in order.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'Incorrect. Jobs are independent of one another (in the formulation used in this module) and so operations in job 2 could be scheduled to start before those in job 1, as long as all the constraints are satisfied.'
    - content: 'Operations in a job must take place in order.'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: 'Correct! The precedence constraint ensures that operation i + 1 does not start before operation i finishes (assuming operations i and i + 1 belong to the same job).'
    - content: 'Machines can only do one thing at a time.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'Incorrect. This is the no-overlap constraint.'

  - content: 'Which of these scenarios violates the no-overlap constraint? The scenario: operations 1 and 2 require the same machine. Operation 1 takes two time steps and operation 2 takes 1 time step.'
    choices:
    - content: 'Operation 1 starts at time t = 0, operation 2 starts at time t = 1.'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: 'Correct! Operation 2 starts only one time step after operation 1, even though operation 1 requires two time steps to complete.'
    - content: 'Operation 1 starts at time t = 0, operation 2 starts at time t = 2.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'Incorrect. This scenario is valid: operation 2 starts two time steps after operation 1, allowing operation 1 to complete before the machine moves on to operation 2.'
    - content: 'Operation 1 starts at time t = 1, operation 2 starts at time t = 4.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'Incorrect. This scenario is valid: operation 2 starts three time steps after operation 1, allowing operation 1 to complete before the machine moves on to operation 2.'
    - content: 'Operation 1 starts at time t = 2, operation 2 starts at time t = 4.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'Incorrect. This scenario is valid: operation 2 starts two time steps after operation 1, allowing operation 1 to complete before the machine moves on to operation 2.'

  - content: 'Which of these scenarios is a valid solution? The bit strings shown indicate the $x_{i,t}$ values for one operation, from $t = 0$ to $t = 3$. For simplicity, we will refer to $x_{i,t}$ as x in the answer explanations.'
    choices:
    - content: '1 0 1 0'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'Incorrect. In this example, the operation is scheduled to start twice (x = 1 twice during the allowed time T).'
    - content: '0 0 0 0'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'Incorrect. In this example, the operation is never scheduled to start (x never equals 1).'
    - content: '1 0 1 1'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'Incorrect. In this example, the operation is scheduled to start three times (x = 1 three times during the allowed time T).'
    - content: '0 1 0 0'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: 'Correct! The operation is scheduled to start once and only once within the allowed time T. This configuration therefore does not violate the operation-once constraint (x = 1 once and only once).'
