Welcome to Azure Quantum!

Azure Quantum is a cloud service for quantum computing and optimization applications. 

In the [Quantum Computing Foundations learning path](), the quantum space exploration crew has been using quantum algorithms to solve some of the decisive problems, such as finding the more suitable route among space stations or supporting the mining mission. But the algorithms had been run on a simulator enabled by the [Quantum Development Kit](). You are finally establishing communication with Earth and need to connect to the hardware through Azure Quantum on Earth to run your algorithms for the mission. 


In this module, you'll set up your access to Azure Quantum and run your first quantum program on hardware through the cloud. Azure Quantum offers two different types of services: optimization solutions, and quantum computing solutions. Different divisions of the quantum space crew will need one of the two different types of solutions that Azure Quantum offers:

- Quantum computing solutions to run quantum algorithms in real or simulated quantum devices. The navigation division will run the Grover's algorithm in Q# for routing between space stations.


- Optimization solutions to address optimization problems using classical hardware. The logistics and maintenance divisions will need this for optimal cargo vessel loading and job scheduling prioritization. 


You will be carrying out these tasks in the upcoming modules.

## Learning objectives

In this module you'll:

- Discover what the Azure Quantum service has to offer: Quantum computing and Optimization
- Prepare your Azure account to use Azure Quantum.
- Create a Quantum Workspace.

## Prerequisites

- None for users in the Optimization path.
