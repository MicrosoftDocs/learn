You're ready to connect to Earth's Azure Quantum services and start solving problems on a real quantum computer. 

In this unit, you learn how to submit a job to Azure Quantum using a Jupyter notebook in the Azure Quantum portal. If you haven´t created an Azure Quantum workspace yet, see the [Get started with Azure Quantum](/training/modules/get-started-azure-quantum/?azure-portal=true) module.

## Copy a sample notebook

To get started, copy the sample notebook from the notebook gallery.

1. Select your Azure Quantum workspace in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
1. Select **Notebooks**.
1. Select **Sample gallery**.
1. Select the **Parallel QRNG** notebook and select **Copy to My Notebooks**.

You can find the sample notebook found under **My Notebooks**. Next, you can run the notebook.

## Run notebook

To run the Jupyter notebook, follow these steps.

1. Select the **parallel-qrng** notebook in **My Notebooks**.
1. Select the cell you want to run and select the **Run** icon to execute the code in the cell, or select **Run all** to run all cells in the notebook.

A Jupyter notebook is a document that contains both explanatory text and code. You can go through each individual cell, run the code, and interpret the output.

> [!NOTE]
> If you have any questions regarding the workspace creation process or run into any issue at any point using Azure Quantum, bookmark [Azure Quantum office hours](https://aka.ms/AQ/OfficeHours) and join our open office hours every Thursday 8∶30 AM Pacific Standard Time zone (PST).

Congratulations, you learned how to use Azure Quantum to create a true quantum random bit generator! However, we don't want quantum computers just to generate random numbers.

In the next units, you'll learn about the different targets available to run your algorithms.
