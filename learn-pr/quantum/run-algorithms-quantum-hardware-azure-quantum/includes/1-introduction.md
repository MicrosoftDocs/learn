Azure Quantum is a cloud service that offers two different types of services:

- **Optimization solutions**: You can use these solutions to solve optimization problems by running optimization algorithms on classical hardware.
- **Quantum computing solutions**: You can use these solutions to run Q# quantum programs on real or simulated quantum devices.

The earlier modules in this [learning path](../../../paths/quantum-computing-fundamentals/index.yml?azure-portal=true) focused on the theoretical aspects of quantum computing. If you've gone through the learning path this far, you've experienced quantum computing as a member of a space mission on a spaceship. Now, you're ready to access Azure Quantum servers on Earth.

In this module, you're ready to start using real quantum computers to run your Q# quantum programs.
You'll explore the quantum-computing options in Azure Quantum and manage submissions of quantum computing jobs.

You'll also learn the basic principles behind quantum hardware and the different kinds of target devices to which you have access in Azure Quantum.

## Learning objectives

After completing this module, you'll be able to:

- Differentiate and comprehend the main hardware solutions for quantum computers.
- Understand how Azure Quantum provides you with access to quantum devices to run quantum algorithms.
- Adapt and create Q# applications to run them in Azure Quantum.
- Submit and manage jobs in Azure Quantum in a Jupyter notebook in the Azure Quantum portal.

## Prerequisites

- [Get started with Azure Quantum](/training/modules/get-started-azure-quantum/?azure-portal=true)
- [Solve graph coloring problems by using Grover's search](/training/modules/solve-graph-coloring-problems-grovers-search/?azure-portal=true)
- An Azure Quantum workspace.

> [!NOTE]
> First-time users automatically get free Azure Quantum Credits for use with each participating quantum hardware provider (500 USD each) when creating your workspace. If you need more credits, you can apply to the [Azure Quantum Credits program](https://aka.ms/aq/credits).
