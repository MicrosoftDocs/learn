Now let's learn how you can use Azure Quantum to test quantum algorithms, first on a simulator and then on real hardware.

If you took a [previous module](/training/modules/solve-graph-coloring-problems-grovers-search/6-implement-grovers-algorithm/?azure-portal=true) of this learning path, you created a version of Grover's algorithm in Q# and ran it on a local simulator. Now let's run the same algorithm in a trapped-ion quantum computer.

## Copy a sample notebook

To get started, copy a sample notebook from the notebook gallery.

1. Log in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and select your Azure Quantum workspace.
1. Select **Notebooks**.
1. In the **Sample gallery**, locate the **Grover's Search** notebook tile, and select **Copy to my notebooks**.
1. You can find the sample notebook under **My notebooks**. Next, you can run the notebook.

## Run the notebook

To run the sample notebook, follow these steps.

1. In **My notebooks**, select the **grovers-search** notebook.
1. To run the full program from top to bottom, select **Run all**.
1. To walk through the example and run each cell individually from top to bottom, select the cell you want to run and select the **Run** icon.

The sample notebook includes both explanatory text and code; you can go through each cell, run the code cells, and interpret the outcomes.

In the next unit, you'll get some ideas to continue exploring quantum computing with Azure Quantum.
