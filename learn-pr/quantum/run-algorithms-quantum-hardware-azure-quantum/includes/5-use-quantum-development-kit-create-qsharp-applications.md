Now let's see how you can use Azure Quantum to test quantum algorithms, first on a simulator and then on real hardware.

If you took a [previous module](/learn/modules/solve-graph-coloring-problems-grovers-search/6-implement-grovers-algorithm/?azure-portal=true) of this learning path, you created a version of Grover's algorithm in Q# and ran it on a local simulator. Now let's run the same algorithm in a trapped ion quantum computer.

## Copy a sample notebook

To get started, copy a sample notebook from the notebook gallery.

1. Log in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and select your Azure Quantum workspace.
1. Select **Notebooks**.
1. In the **Sample gallery**, locate the **Grover's Search** notebook tile, and select **Copy to my notebooks**.
1. The sample notebook can be found under **My notebooks** and you can now run the notebook.

## Run the notebook

To run the sample notebook, follow these steps.

1. In **My notebooks**, select the **grovers-search** notebook. 
1. To run the full program from top to bottom, select **Run all**. 
1. To walk through the example and run each cell individually from top to bottom, select the cell you want to run and select the **run icon**.

The sample notebook includes both explanatory text and code; you can go through each cell, run the code cells and interprete the outcomes. 


In the next unit, you're going to see some ideas to continue exploring quantum computing with Azure Quantum.
