Congratulations! You just learned how to use the Azure Quantum platform to run your Q# quantum computing programs on quantum hardware.

In this module, we covered a lot. Here are a few key concepts to keep in mind:

* Azure Quantum lets you run Q# programs on quantum computers through industry-leading providers.
* To build quantum computers, we need controllable quantum systems that satisfy a demanding list of conditions.
* Trapped-ion and superconducting qubit quantum computers are the two most prominent platforms for quantum computing nowadays.
* You can use the Azure Quantum CLI to submit and manage jobs to quantum computers.
* The Azure Quantum system offers three different kinds of profiles to handle the control flow limitations of early quantum computers: Full, No Control Flow, and Basic Measurement Feedback.
