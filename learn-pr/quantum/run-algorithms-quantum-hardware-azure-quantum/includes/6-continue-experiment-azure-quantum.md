Now that you know how to submit your work to Azure Quantum, you're ready to start running your own experiments with real quantum hardware.

Keep in mind that current quantum computers offer a limited number of qubits, but this number is expected to grow in the next few years. Meanwhile, as a member of the quantum space explorer team, you can start by testing your quantum applications and preparing yourself for the quantum revolution. Let's see what you can do with current quantum devices.

## Run tests of quantum mechanics

Quantum computers are a fantastic platform to continue the scientific validation of quantum theories. The widely available access to controllable quantum devices empowers researchers and enthusiasts to run scientific tests without the need of access to restricted expensive laboratories.

For example, you can use Q# and Azure Quantum to verify the validity of quantum theory by realizing an empirical observation of the violation of quantum inequalities. A famous example that experiments with a Q# implementation is the [CHSH game](/samples/microsoft/quantum/validating-quantum-mechanics/?azure-portal=true).

## Implement and test early prototypes of quantum algorithms

The small number of qubits might not allow us to run practical quantum applications today, but the early quantum computers are useful tools to test the working principle of quantum algorithms.

Sometimes, hardware results differ from those of the simulations, because simulators often take assumptions that don't hold in real systems. These differences need to be taken into account in the programs to make them runnable in real quantum computers.

Testing simplified versions of quantum algorithms in hardware helps to discover these limitations and adapt the programs to overcome them. By testing your algorithms in the quantum computers of today, you can prepare your programs for the future.

## Exploit your creativity to get the maximum value from the hardware

Working with few qubits is a daunting task, but it encourages creativity to exploit the available resources optimally. Do you have an algorithm in mind, but it needs many qubits? Try to optimize it so that the qubits are used wisely to save resources.

In the next section, you'll take a test to check what you've learned in this module.
