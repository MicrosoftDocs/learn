Quantum computing uses quantum properties such as superposition, interference, and entanglement to perform computations. For simulating quantum mechanical systems such as molecules, quantum computing provides important speedups.

In this module, you learned how to create a quantum workspace to create and run your jobs on the Azure Quantum service.
