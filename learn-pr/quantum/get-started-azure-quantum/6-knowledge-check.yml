quiz:
  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:

  - content: 'Azure Quantum offers quantum computing solutions and optimization solutions. What is the difference between them?'
    choices:
    - content: 'Quantum computing is only for simulating quantum systems like molecules. Optimization uses quantum computers to solve optimization problems.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Quantum computing is not restricted to simulating quantum systems. The optimization solutions don't use quantum computers."
    - content: 'You can use quantum computing to run quantum algorithms in quantum hardware, and you can use optimization to solve optimization problems by using classical hardware.'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Quantum computing consists of running quantum algorithms such as Grover's algorithm in a real or simulated quantum device, whereas optimization consists of solving optimization problems by using classical computers."
    - content: 'You use quantum computing to run quantum algorithms in quantum hardware, and then you use optimization to run those algorithms more efficiently.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Quantum computing and optimization address different kinds of problems."

  - content: 'Which of the following statements about Azure Quantum is *false*?'
    choices:
    - content: 'Simulators, quantum computers, and optimization solvers are examples of targets of Azure Quantum.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This statement is correct."
    - content: 'Each job has an ID that must be unique within the workspace.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This statement is correct."
    - content: "You can submit jobs without an Azure storage account, but having one is recommended for keeping your results."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "This statement is false. You must own an Azure storage account to create a quantum workspace and submit jobs."

  - content: 'Which of the following statements about quantum-inspired optimization in Azure Quantum is *true*?'
    choices:
    - content: 'Emulating quantum effects on classical computers has led to the development of new types of quantum solutions that run on classical hardware, also called quantum-inspired algorithms.'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "This statement is correct. These algorithms allow us to use some of the advantages of quantum computing approaches today on classical hardware."
    - content: 'Azure Quantum offers only quantum-inspired optimization solutions. For classical optimization, you should look into other Azure products.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This statement is false. Azure Quantum also offers optimization solvers that aren't quantum inspired."
    - content: 'Quantum-inspired optimization solutions in Azure Quantum are useful for machine learning.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This statement is false. Although machine learning problems can often be expressed as optimization problems, Azure Quantum optimization solvers are generally not suitable for solving machine learning problems."
