In this unit, you implement the second phase of your quantum random number generator: combining multiple random bits to form a larger random number. This phase builds on the random bit generator that you already created. You'll need to write some classical code for this phase.

## Can I write classical code in Q#?

Yes, you can. Quantum computers perform specialized tasks. You don't use a quantum computer for everything because, for many tasks, classical computers work fine.

Just like a graphics processing unit (GPU) or other specialized hardware, you want to use a quantum computer for the tasks they're best suited for. In this case, you want to produce purely random bits.

For this reason, Q# enables you to write classical code that resembles programming languages you already know.

Let's see how you can use Q# features to build a complete random number generator.

## Define the random number generator logic

Let's outline what the logic of a random number generator should be, provided the random bit generator built in the previous unit:

1. Define `max` as the maximum number you want to generate.
1. Define the number of random bits that you need to generate, by calculating how many bits, `nBits`, you need to express integers up to `max`.
1. Generate a random bit string that's `nBits` in length.
1. If the bit string represents a number greater than `max`, go back to step three.
1. Otherwise, the process is complete. Return the generated number as an integer.

As an example, let's set `max` to 12. That is, 12 is the largest number you want to get from the random number generator. 

You need ${\lfloor ln(12) / ln(2) + 1 \rfloor}$, or 4 bits to represent a number between 0 and 12. (For brevity, we skip how to derive this equation.)

Let's say you generate the bit string ${1101_{\ binary}}$, which is equivalent to ${13_{\ decimal}}$. Because 13 is greater than 12, you repeat the process.

Next, you generate the bit string ${0110_{\ binary}}$, which is equivalent to ${6_{\ decimal}}$. Because 6 is less than 12, the process is complete.

The quantum random number generator returns the number 6.

## Create a complete random number generator

Here, you expand on the `RandomNumberGenerator.qs` file to build larger random numbers.

### Add the required libraries

For the complete random number generator, you need to include three Q# libraries: `Microsoft.Quantum.Math`, `Microsoft.Quantum.Intrinsic`, and `Microsoft.Quantum.Convert`. Add the following `open` directives to `RandomNumberGenerator.qs`, like this:

```qsharp
namespace QuantumRandomNumberGenerator {
open Microsoft.Quantum.Convert;
open Microsoft.Quantum.Intrinsic;
open Microsoft.Quantum.Math;

// The rest of the code goes here.

}
```

### Define the quantum random number operation

Here, you define the `GenerateRandomNumberInRange` operation. This operation repeatedly calls the `GenerateRandomBit` operation to build a string of bits.

Modify `RandomNumberGenerator.qs` like this:

```qsharp
namespace QuantumRandomNumberGenerator {
    open Microsoft.Quantum.Convert;
    open Microsoft.Quantum.Intrinsic;
    open Microsoft.Quantum.Math;

    /// Generates a random number between 0 and `max`.
    operation GenerateRandomNumberInRange(max : Int) : Int {
        // Determine the number of bits needed to represent `max` and store it
        // in the `nBits` variable. Then generate `nBits` random bits which will
        // represent the generated random number.
        mutable bits = [];
        let nBits = BitSizeI(max);
        for idxBit in 1..nBits {
            set bits += [GenerateRandomBit()];
        }
        let sample = ResultArrayAsInt(bits);

        // Return random number if it is within the requested range.
        // Generate it again if it is outside the range.
        return sample > max ? GenerateRandomNumberInRange(max) | sample;
    }
}
```

Let's take a moment to review the new code.

* You need to calculate the number of bits needed to express integers up to `max`. The `BitSizeI` function from the `Microsoft.Quantum.Math` library converts an integer to the number of bits needed to represent it.
* The `GenerateRandomNumberInRange` operation uses a `for` loop to generate random numbers until it generates one that's equal to or less than `max`. The `for` loop works exactly the same as a `for` loop in other programming languages.
* The variable `bits` is a mutable variable. A mutable variable is one that can change during the computation. You use the `set` directive to change a mutable variable's value.
* The `ResultArrayAsInt` function comes from the `Microsoft.Quantum.Convert` library. This function converts the bit string to a positive integer.

### Define the entry point

Your program can now generate random numbers. Here, you define the entry point for your program.

Modify `RandomNumberGenerator.qs` file like this:

```qsharp
namespace QuantumRandomNumberGenerator {
    open Microsoft.Quantum.Convert;
    open Microsoft.Quantum.Intrinsic;
    open Microsoft.Quantum.Math;

    @EntryPoint()
    operation Main() : Int {
        let max = 100;
        Message($"Sampling a random number between 0 and {max}: ");

        // Generate random number in the 0..max range.
        return GenerateRandomNumberInRange(max);
    }

    /// Generates a random number between 0 and `max`.
    operation GenerateRandomNumberInRange(max : Int) : Int {
        // Determine the number of bits needed to represent `max` and store it
        // in the `nBits` variable. Then generate `nBits` random bits which will
        // represent the generated random number.
        mutable bits = [];
        let nBits = BitSizeI(max);
        for idxBit in 1..nBits {
            set bits += [GenerateRandomBit()];
        }
        let sample = ResultArrayAsInt(bits);

        // Return random number if it is within the requested range.
        // Generate it again if it is outside the range.
        return sample > max ? GenerateRandomNumberInRange(max) | sample;
    }

    operation GenerateRandomBit() : Result {
        // Allocate a qubit.
        use q = Qubit();

        // Set the qubit into superposition of 0 and 1 using the Hadamard operation
        H(q);

        // At this point the qubit `q` has 50% chance of being measured in the
        // |0〉 state and 50% chance of being measured in the |1〉 state.
        // Measure the qubit value using the `M` operation, and store the
        // measurement value in the `result` variable.
        let result = M(q);

        // Reset qubit to the |0〉 state.
        // Qubits must be in the |0〉 state by the time they are released.
        Reset(q);

        // Return the result of the measurement.
        return result;
    }
}
```

The `let` directive declares variables that don't change during the computation. For learning purposes, here we define the maximum value as 100.

> [!NOTE]
> This code snippet does not currently run on any available Azure Quantum hardware targets, as the callable `ResultArrayAsInt` requires a QPU with [full computation profile](/azure/quantum/concepts-targets-in-azure-quantum#quantum-processing-units-qpu-different-profiles).

## Run the program

Let's try out our new random number generator!

1. Before running the program, you need to set the target profile to **Unrestricted**. Select **View -> Command Palette**, search for QIR, select **Q#: Set the Azure Quantum QIR target profile**, and then select **Q#: unrestricted**. 
1. To test run your program locally on the built-in simulator, select **Run Q# File** from the play icon drop-down in the top-right, or press **Ctrl+F5**. Your output will appear in the debug console.
1. Run the program again to see a different result.

> [!NOTE]
> If the target profile is not set to **Unrestricted**, you will get an error when you run the program.

Congratulations! Now you know how to combine classical logic with Q# to create a quantum random number generator.

## Bonus exercise

Modify the program to also require the generated random number to be greater than some minimum number, `min`, instead of zero.
