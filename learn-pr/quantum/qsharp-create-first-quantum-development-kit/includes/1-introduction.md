In this module, you write your first quantum program by using the Azure Quantum Development Kit (QDK). The QDK enables you to write your quantum programs, then test them with a simulator, and finally run them on real quantum hardware.

You write a quantum program to generate random numbers. A quantum random number generator is a perfect introduction to quantum computing because it illustrates quantum behavior and requires only a few lines of code. You will also review the basic structure of a Q# program.

## Learning objectives

After completing this module, you're able to:

- Allocate qubits and apply quantum operations to them.
- Create and run Q# programs in Visual Studio Code.
- Explain how Q# programs are structured.

## Prerequisites

- A basic understanding of quantum computing concepts.
- Basic knowledge of classical programming concepts.
- The latest version of [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) or open [VS Code on the Web](https://vscode.dev/quantum).
- The latest version of the [Azure Quantum Development Kit](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=quantum.qsharp-lang-vscode) extension.
