Congratulations! Your first Q# program, although basic, gave you practice performing quantum operations.

Visual Studio Code and the QDK provide you with everything you need to start writing and verifying your own quantum algorithms right away.

In this module, we covered a lot. Here are a few key concepts to keep in mind:

* A qubit is a basic unit of quantum information, analogous to a bit in classical computing.
* Superposition is a quantum phenomenon where a qubit is in a combination of both zero and one states. When measured, a qubit goes from being in superposition to one of the classical states.
* You can combine classical code with quantum code. This combination enables you to perform quantum computations and work with the results, all in the same program.
* A `repeat` loop enables you to repeat a quantum operation until it achieves a specific result.
