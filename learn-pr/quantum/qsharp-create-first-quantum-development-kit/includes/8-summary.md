Congratulations! Your first Q# program, although basic, gave you practice performing quantum operations.

Visual Studio Code and the QDK provide you with everything you need to start writing and verifying your own quantum algorithms right away.

Azure Quantum is a cloud service that provides access to quantum hardware. It's currently in limited preview, but you can [request early access](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/quantum/#contact?azure-portal=true).

In this module, we covered a lot. Here are a few key concepts to keep in mind:

* A qubit is a basic unit of quantum information, analogous to a bit in classical computing.
* Superposition is a quantum phenomena where a qubit is in a combination of both zero and one states. When measured, a qubit goes from being in superposition to one of the classical states.
* You can combine classical code with quantum code. This enables you to perform quantum computations and work with the results, all in the same program.
* A `repeat` loop enables you to repeat a quantum operation until it achieves a specific result.

If you're interested in learning more, the [Solve optimization problems by using quantum-inspired optimization](/learn/modules/solve-quantum-inspired-optimization-problems/?azure-portal=true) module is a great next step. There you'll see how you can apply algorithms inspired by quantum physics to solve difficult optimization problems.

Also, be sure to explore the [Microsoft Quantum Documentation](/quantum/?azure-portal=true). There you'll find comprehensive reference material, including:

* Fundamental concepts around quantum computing.
* Quickstarts and tutorials.
* Q# language and API reference.
* How to use Q# with C#, Python, and Jupyter notebooks.

Once you're ready to dive deeper, you can [browse code samples](/samples/browse/?languages=qsharp&azure-portal=true) or [learn quantum computing with the Quantum Katas](/quantum/intro-to-katas?azure-portal=true).
