Congratulations! You successfully created your first Q# program.

The Quantum Development Kit provides you with everything you need to start writing and verifying your own quantum algorithms right away.

In this module, we covered a lot. Here are a few key concepts to keep in mind:

- A Q# program must have an entry point, which is the `Main` operation.
- In Q#, you allocate a qubit by using the `use` keyword and the `Qubit` type. The qubit is always in the $\ket{0}$ state.
- Superposition is a quantum phenomenon where a qubit is in a combination of both zero and one states. If a qubit is in the $\ket{0}$ state, you can put it into superposition by using the `H` operation.
- In Q#, you use the `M` operation to measure qubits in the Z-basis. When measured, a qubit goes from being in superposition to one of the classical states.
- You can combine classical code with quantum code. This combination enables you to perform quantum computations and work with the results, all in the same program.

## Next steps

The Quantum Development Kit includes a set of built-in Q# samples that you can use to learn more about Q# and quantum computing. To view the samples, open a blank Q# file in Visual Studio Code and type `sample`, then select the sample you want to view from the list of options. For example, you can find the Q# code we used in unit 2 by selecting *Random Bit sample*.
