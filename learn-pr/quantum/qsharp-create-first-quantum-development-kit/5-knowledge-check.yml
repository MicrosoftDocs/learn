quiz:
  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:

  - content: 'Which of these statements is true about the random number generator that you built in this module?'
    choices:
    - content: "The quantum random number generator takes the current time from the CPU's clock as a seed to generate random numbers."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The quantum random number generator doesn't use the CPU's clock to generate random numbers. A classical pseudo-random number generator would do that."
    - content: "The quantum random number generator creates one qubit, measures it, and the result of the measurement is a random decimal number."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The result of the measurement of a qubit is a random bit, not a random decimal number. This isn't the logic behind the random number generator that you built in this module."
    - content: "The quantum random number generator creates a bit string from the repetition of measurements of a qubit in superposition. Then, it takes the bit string and converts it to a decimal number."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "This is the logic behind the random number generator that you built in this module."

  - content: 'Which of the following structures are required for a Q# program to run successfully?'
    choices:
    - content: 'To run successfully, a Q# program must have a function.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "A function is not required in a Q# program."
    - content: "To run successfully, a Q# program must have an entry point, which is the `Main` operation."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Every Q# program must have an entry point, which is the `Main` operation, so the Q# compiler knows where to start the program."
    - content: "To run successfully, a Q# program must have an entry point and at least one allocated qubit."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "You can write Q# programs that don't need to perform operations on a qubit. A Q# program without a qubit allocated can run successfully."

  - content: "Consider a quantum operation `A` that acts on a single qubit. If you want to write a Q# program that applies `A` to a qubit `q`, which of the following statements is true?"
    choices:
    - content: "You allocate a qubit using `q = Qubit();` and then apply `A` to `q` using `A(q);`."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "To allocate a qubit, you must use the `use` keyword, `use q = Qubit();`."
    - content: "You allocate a qubit using `use q = Qubit();` and then apply `A` to `q` using `A(q);`."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "You first allocate a qubit using `use` and then apply `A` to the qubit allocated using `A(q);`."
    - content: "You allocate a qubit using `use q = Qubit();` and then apply `A` to `q` using `A[q];`."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "To apply an operation to a qubit, you must use parentheses, `A(q);`."
