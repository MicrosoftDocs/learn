title: Create your first Q# program by using the Quantum Development Kit
summary: Get started with Q# programming by building a quantum random number generator.
abstract: |
  By the end of this module, you'll be able to:
  - Allocate qubits and apply quantum operations to them.
  - Create a Q# program by using the Azure Quantum Development Kit.
  - Explain how Q# programs are structured.

  During this module, you will:
  - Learn the basic structure of a Q# program.
  - Create a new Q# file.
  - Define the logic of a problem.
  - Combine classical and quantum operations to solve a problem.
  - Work with qubits and quantum operations to build a quantum random number generator.
  
prerequisites: |
  - A basic understanding of quantum computing concepts.
  - Basic knowledge of classical programming concepts.
  - The latest version of [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) or open [VS Code on the Web](https://vscode.dev/).
  - The latest version of the [Azure Quantum Development Kit](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=quantum.qsharp-lang-vscode) extension.
