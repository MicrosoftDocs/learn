  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:

  - content: 'Which of these statements is true about the random number generator that you built in this module?'
    choices:
    - content: 'You always get truly random numbers, both in the simulator and on quantum hardware.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'A quantum computer can produce truly random numbers. Although the simulator produces pseudorandom numbers, you can use it to test and verify your algorithms.'
    - content: 'You never get truly random numbers. You get only pseudorandom numbers.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'A quantum computer can produce truly random numbers. The simulator produces pseudorandom numbers.'
    - content: 'In the simulator, you get pseudorandom numbers. On a quantum computer, you get truly random numbers.'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: 'Although the simulator produces pseudorandom numbers, you can use it to test and verify your algorithms.'

  - content: 'You need to run a quantum computation multiple times and then compute the average of all results. The easiest way to do that is to:'
    choices:
    - content: 'Run the quantum program multiple times and then route the results to a second program, which computes the average.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'Although you _could_ route the results to a second program, is there an easier way?'
    - content: 'Combine classical and quantum operations in the same program.'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: 'Quantum computers perform specialized tasks. Q# enables you to write classical code that resembles programming languages you already know. Averaging a set of numbers is a good use of classical code.'
    - content: 'Write the quantum computation and the averaging computation all as quantum operations.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Quantum computers perform specialized tasks. You don't use a quantum computer for everything because, for basic tasks like averaging a set of numbers, classical computers work fine."

  - content: "You're ready to run your algorithm on Azure Quantum. What's the best way to choose which hardware runs your code most efficiently?"
    choices:
    - content: 'Run a more limited version of your program on each hardware type and then choose the one that completes most quickly.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'Are there tools that you can use to eliminate the guesswork?'
    - content: 'Combine the simulator with the resource estimator to understand the resources that your code would require.'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Using these tools together helps you understand the features of a quantum computer that you'd need in order to run your program, such as the types of quantum gates you use, the number of operations performed, or the number of qubits you need."
    - content: "There isn't a need to choose. All quantum hardware uses resources in the exact same way."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Different workloads can require different hardware capabilities. Azure Quantum provides tools that help you understand the resources that your code would require."
