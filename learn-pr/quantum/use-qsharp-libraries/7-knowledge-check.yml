  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:

  - content: "What are the domain-specific Q# libraries provided with the QDK?" 
    choices:
    - content: "Standard, chemistry, numerics, and machine learning"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The domain-specific libraries are chemistry, numerics, and machine learning. They must be explicitly added to Q# projects, whereas the contents of the standard library are automatically accessible." 
    - content: "Arithmetic, preparation, and diagnostics"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Those are `Microsoft.Quantum.<>` namespaces. The domain-specific libraries are chemistry, numerics, and machine learning." 
    - content: "Chemistry, numerics, and machine learning" 
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct!"

  - content: "How can you use additional Q# libraries besides the standard library?" 
    choices:
    - content: "Simply create a Q# project and start programming."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "New Q# projects automatically include the standard library by default, but using other libraries requires adding the corresponding NuGet package to the project." 
    - content: "Add the corresponding NuGet package to a Q# project."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct!"

  - content: "The Q# API documentation is..." 
    choices:
    - content: "something only experts should use as a reference."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "It's a valuable resource that can help both beginners and experts." 
    - content: "neither worth exploring nor using as a reference when writing programs."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The Q# API documentation is a valuable resource that should absolutely be explored."
    - content: "automatically generated from documentation comments in the source code, and is published on the Microsoft Quantum Documentation website."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct!"

  - content: "Documentation comments are denoted with _____ slashes, and should go immediately _____ the callable or type declaration to be interpreted as such by the compiler." 
    choices:
    - content: "two; before"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Two slashes `//` delineate *general* comments, which can be written anywhere in Q# files and are simply ignored by the compiler. The lines of documentation comments must begin with `///` and are treated specially by the compiler. They must be placed outside and immediately preceding the declaration, or the compiler will ignore them as general comments."
    - content: "two; after"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Two slashes `//` delineate *general* comments, which can be written anywhere in Q# files and are simply ignored by the compiler. The lines of documentation comments must begin with `///` and are treated specially by the compiler. They must be placed outside and immediately preceding the declaration, or the compiler will ignore them as general comments."
    - content: "three; before"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! In contrast to general comments, which are delineated by two slashes `//` and can be written anywhere in Q# files, the lines of documentation comments must begin with `///` to be treated as such by the compiler. They must be placed outside and immediately preceding the declaration, or the compiler will ignore them as general comments." 
    - content: "three; after"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "In contrast to general comments, which are delineated by two slashes `//` and can be written anywhere in Q# files, the lines of documentation comments must begin with `///` and are treated specially by the compiler. They must be placed outside and immediately preceding the declaration, or the compiler will ignore them as general comments."
