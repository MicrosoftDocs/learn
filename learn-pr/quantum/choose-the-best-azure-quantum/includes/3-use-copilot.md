To start exploring the Copilot and coding in Azure Quantum, use one of the samples from the **Quantum Samples** dropdown.

## Run a quantum program

1. Navigate to the [Code in Azure Quantum](https://quantum.microsoft.com/en-us/experience/quantum-coding).
1. Select **Quantum Samples** and then select **Random Number Generator**. The following code is copied to the code window.

    ```qsharp
    /// # Sample
    /// Quantum Random Number Generator
    ///
    /// # Description
    /// This program implements a quantum ranndom number generator by setting qubits
    /// in superposition and then using the measurement results as random bits.
    namespace Sample {
        open Microsoft.Quantum.Measurement;
        open Microsoft.Quantum.Intrinsic;
    
        @EntryPoint()
        operation Main() : Result[] {
            // Generate 5-bit random number.
            let nBits = 5;
            return GenerateNRandomBits(nBits);
        }
    
        /// # Summary
        /// Generates N random bits.
        operation GenerateNRandomBits(nBits : Int) : Result[] {
            // Allocate N qubits.
            use register = Qubit[nBits];
    
            // Set the qubits into superposition of 0 and 1 using the Hadamard
            // operation `H`.
            for qubit in register {
                H(qubit);
            }
    
            // At this point each has 50% chance of being measured in the |0〉 state
            // and 50% chance of being measured in the |1〉 state.
            // Measure each qubit and reset them all so they can be safely
            // deallocated.
            let results = MeasureEachZ(register);
            ResetAll(register);
            return results;
        }
    }
    ```

1. Select **In-Memory Simulator**.
1. Select **Run**.

    - The results are displayed in the **Results** field, and a histogram of the results is displayed below the code window. 
    - You can move the slider for **Select number of shots** to specify how many times the program is run.
    - The **Shots** field displays the result for each shot. 

To run your program again using a different simulator:

1. Select the **In-Memory Simulator** dropdown and select **Quantinuum H-Series Emulator**.
1. Select the number of shots (currently limited to 20) and select **Run**.

    - The job status is displayed at the top of the code window.
    - A histogram of the results is displayed below the code window. Results for each shot aren't currently available with the Quantinuum H-Series Emulator.

## Ask the Copilot

You can prompt the Copilot in Azure Quantum for almost anything quantum related. For example ask the Copilot the following questions and see what happens:

- "Explain the MResetZ operation"
- "Write Q# code that entangles two qubits"
- "Explain quantum interference"
- "What is the difference between a qubit and a classical bit?"

## Open your code sample on VS Code for the Web

To explore the sample code further, you can open the code in [VS Code for the Web](https://vscode.dev) and take advantage of features such as improved error messaging, Q# syntax highlighting, and integrated debugging. If you already have an Azure account set up, you can connect directly to your Azure Quantum workspaces from VS Code.

To open your code in VS Code for the Web, select the VS Code icon on the bottom of the code window.
