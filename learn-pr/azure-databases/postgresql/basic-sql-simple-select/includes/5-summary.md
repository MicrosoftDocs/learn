This tutorial provided a practical foundation for retrieving and manipulating data in PostgreSQL using the `SELECT` statement.

You should now be able to select all or specific columns from a table, eliminate duplicates using the `DISTINCT` keyword, create calculated columns through arithmetic operations or functions and concatenate values to produce more readable outputs.

By mastering these concepts, you're equipped to write efficient and insightful queries that support data exploration and reporting in real-world PostgreSQL scenarios.
