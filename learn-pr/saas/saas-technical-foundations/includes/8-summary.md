## Plan for SaaS solution

In this learn module you have learned about technical concepts for SaaS solutions, such as:

- Tenancy models - multitenant and single-tenant
- Difference between monolithic and microservices architectures
- The most common Azure services for SaaS and microservices architectures
- How to handle authentication and authorization in SaaS solution and in microservices architecture



If you are getting started with your SaaS solution, the first stage is all about getting the technical and functional requirements of the solution and aligning architecture and technology to it. 

- What is considered tenant in your case?
- What are security/compliance, availability and scalability requirements?
- Is your solution expected to be multi-regional solution?
- Who are end-users and do they require SSO or separate identity?

The answers to these and other questions will be the requirements for your future SaaS architecture.
