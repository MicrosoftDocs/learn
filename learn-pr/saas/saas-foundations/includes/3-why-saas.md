Let’s focus on the main motivational drives for the SaaS model from both customer point of view, and software provider point of view. 

## Customers motivations for using SaaS products

- #### Pay per usage 

  This consumption model provides customers with more freedom and the ability to pay only for what and how much they use 

- #### Lower TCO (Total Cost of Ownership)
  
  By purchasing Software-as-a-Service customers don't need to invest in own hardware, internal resources, IT and Operations, since the software provider takes care of the underlying infrastructure and operations for it. 
  
- #### Purchase model
  
  If necessary and is aligned with IT management, business owners can gain  more control over picking the solutions, instead of IT being in charge.
  
- #### OpEx over CapEx
  
  There are also financial and tax reasons why customers prefer to purchase SaaS solutions, since OpEx offers more immediate tax deduction benefits

## Software's provider motivations for creating SaaS business vs traditional license based product

- #### Market demand

  Customers prefer SaaS models, so software providers are pressured to provide consumption-based software

- #### Financial impact

  It has been proven with examples in the market that SaaS companies are able to achieve higher valuation, including Microsoft own business transformation.

- #### Costs

  Since now software provider also takes care of underlying infrastructure, with the right architecture, development and operating model it's easier and cheaper to support customers on one single platform

- #### Economies of scale

  When providers sell software, they sell the "copy" of it. Compared to traditional manufacturing, when the same type of items is produced with the high volume that brings the price per unit down. The same with software - the more users are on the platform, the higher margins are. Providers aren't only selling the copy of the software, but the whole service, which means that the underlying infrastructure costs are also part of it. 

## Mutual motivations for SaaS model

- #### Faster time to market

  Being in control of the underlying environment and operations allows software providers to deliver new functionality to customers faster

- #### Security

  Having responsibility for protecting customer data as well as the latest security and compliance regulations guarantees security for customers



## Contoso scenario

For Contoso it makes perfect sense to deliver SaaS service, because their target customers would not like to support their own infrastructure for websites and have dedicated designers. Contoso's customers prefer to pay only for the services they've used. 

On top of that, Contoso provides the value of data analysis and auto-improvements, without this functionality customers will have to hire a web developer and designer to perform analysis and suggest/implement the changes.
