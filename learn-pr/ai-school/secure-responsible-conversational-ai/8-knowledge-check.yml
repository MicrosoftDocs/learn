  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "What is the best way to identify the biases a bot may have before deployment?"
    choices:
    - content: "A review of the literature around your bots use case."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While a review of relevant literature can be beneficial, bias can be introduced at every stage. It is important to always take fairness and diversity into account, no matter what stage of creation the bot is at."
    - content: "Thorough testing of the bots responses in a test environment."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Thorough testing of the bot in a test environment is vital, but bias can be introduced at every stage of the creation process."
    - content: "Include fairness and diversity at every level of the ideation and creation process."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. As bias can be introduced at every stage, itâ€™s important to always include fairness and diversity at every level."
    - content: "A systematic review of all datasets being used."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While a review of all data being used is beneficial, bias can be introduced at many other stages."
  - content: "What information should your bot collect?"
    choices:
    - content: "All information possible."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Collecting more information than your bot requires decreases user trust and creates extra privacy concerns."
    - content: "Only information from users that it needs to perform its job."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Only collecting relevant information that the bot needs to perform its job is vital to earning and keeping user trust, and helps with privacy concerns."
    - content: "Age and gender information."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Your bot should only collect this information it needs to, so it can perform its job correctly."
    - content: "As much information as possible while hiding the fact your bot is collecting information."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Your bot should be upfront with users about what information it is collecting, and only collect what information it needs."
  - content: "How should you plan to tackle abnormal behavior and misuse of your bot?"
    choices:
    - content: "Have systems to detect abnormal behaviors and prevent manipulation."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Having systems can identify abnormal behaviors and malicious users, including non-human actors, are the best way to detect and deal with non-desirable uses of your bot."
    - content: "Design your bot so abnormal behaviors and manipulation are impossible."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. You need to be able to identify abnormal behavior and misuse of your bot as it is impossible to be fully certain your system is immune to these behaviors."
    - content: "You should not worry about abnormal behavior and misuse - it is expected of chatbots."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Users expect you to prevent abnormal behavior and misuse, and you ethically and legally must take steps to limit abnormal behavior and misuse."
    - content: "Use trusted libraries and frameworks during code development."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While using trusted libraries and frameworks is a good start, it is not a strategy that will be able to tackle abnormal behavior and misuse of your bot alone."
  - content: "Who is responsible for your bot?"
    choices:
    - content: "The end user."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The end user is not accountable for your bot and its operations, the people involved in creating the bot must take responsibility."
    - content: "Company leadership."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While company leadership is responsible, they are not solely responsible - all people who create bots are responsible and accountable for them."
    - content: "There's no responsibility - people don't have to user your bot if they don't want to."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. There must be some responsibility for bots. Legally and ethically the people who create bots must be responsible for their operations."
    - content: "The developers of bots have responsibility and are accountable for their bots."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The developers of bots are responsible and accountable for their bots, ethically and legally."
