We read that unsupervised learning algorithms can split data into categories without ever having been trained, and not having labels to judge its own accuracy from. These methods are reguarly very helpful with large unlabeled datasets or ambiguous problems. Unsupervised learning is commonly seen in the fields of science and statistics.

We learned about k-means clustering, which can be given unlabeled data and identify a number of clusters in that data. k-means can be performed in a few seconds.

Now that you have reviewed this module, you should be able to:

* Define unsupervised learning.
* Apply k-means clustering to predict groupings in data.

Well done! You’ve completed the module on unsupervised learning.
