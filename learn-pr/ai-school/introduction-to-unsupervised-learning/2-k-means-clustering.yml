  questions:
  - content: "The 'k' in k-means clustering refers to:"
    choices:
    - content: "The number of clusters it will attempt to find."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The number of clusters k-means will attempt to find is also directed by the user."
    - content: "The number of iterations it will perform."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. k-means will attempt to find k-number of clusters."
    - content: "The number of datapoints it will process."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The 'k' does not involve the number of data points, rather the number of clusters it will attempt to find."
    - content: "An optimizer for machine learning algorithms."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. k-means clustering is an algorithm itself."
  - content: "k-means clustering has how many steps that are repeated?"
    choices:
    - content: "One."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. k-means has more than one step that it uses to train."
    - content: "Zero."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Algorithms have to have at least one step."
    - content: "Two."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. k-means has a step that assigns examples to clusters, and then a step that moves the starting points to the average value of the examples grouped to that cluster."
    - content: "Four."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. k-means has fewer steps, that are repeated one after the other."
