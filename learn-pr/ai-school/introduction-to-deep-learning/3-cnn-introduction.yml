  questions:
  - content: "Convolutional neural networks (CNNs):"
    choices:
    - content: "Are mostly used for image and video analysis."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. While there are many applications for CNNs, they are most popular for image and video analysis."
    - content: "Avoid problems with overfitting seen in more traditional neural networks."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. CNNs can still run into similar overfitting issues as traditional neural networks."
    - content: "Require much smaller datasets than other types of machine learning."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. CNNs tend to require larger datasets than traditional machine learning."
    - content: "Train faster than traditional large neural networks."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The feature extraction performed by CNNs can increase the training time required."
