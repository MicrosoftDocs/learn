  questions:
  - content: "Artificial Neural Networks can perform:"
    choices:
    - content: "Classification."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Neural networks can perform regression functions also."
    - content: "Both classification and regression."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Neural networks can both predict categories and numbers."
    - content: "Regression."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Neural networks can also easily perform classification using the softmax function."
    - content: "Abstract thought."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Neural networks are not capable of performing abstract thought."
  - content: "Which is correct? Artificial neural networks:"
    choices:
    - content: "Have two or more layers, each of which contains many nodes."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Neural networks must have at least an input layer and an output layer."
    - content: "Have two or more nodes, each of which contains many layers."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Nodes reside in layers."
    - content: "Can hide layers from the programmer."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Although middle layers are named  as 'hidden' they are visible to the programmer."
    - content: "Only have two edges."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Neural networks can have many edges."
    - content: "Edges:"
    choices:
    - content: "Connect nodes to one another"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Edges connect nodes from layer to layer."
    - content: "Are nodes that are at the edge of layers"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Edges are not a type of node, edges connect nodes."
    - content: "Are layers that are at the front or end of the neural network"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Edges connect nodes (and thus layers) together, but edges are not layers themselves."
    - content: "Hide layers from the programmer."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Edges can't hide layers, they connect nodes (and thus layers) together."
