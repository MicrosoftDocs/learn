In Python, lists can store any type of value, such as strings or numbers:

```python
planets = ["Mercury", "Venus", "Earth", "Mars", "Jupiter", "Saturn", "Uranus", "Neptune"]
```

You can access any item in a list by enclosing the _index_ in brackets (`[]`) after the variable name. Indexes start from 0:

```python
planets = ["Mercury", "Venus", "Earth", "Mars", "Jupiter", "Saturn", "Uranus", "Neptune"]

print("The first planet is ", planets[0])
print("The second planet is ", planets[1])
print("The third planet is ", planets[2])
```

You can also determine the number of items in a list by using `len`. So you could use a `while` loop and a counter to loop or iterate over each item in the list. Because this operation is so common, Python provides `for` loops, which you can use to iterate over lists.

> [!NOTE]
> Python has many types that can be looped over. These types are known as *iterables*.

Python lists are iterable, and they can be used with a `for` loop. You use a `for` loop with iterables where you loop a known number of times, once for each item in the iterable.

## About `for` loops

Here's an example `for` loop that counts down from 4 to 0:

```python
countdown = [4, 3, 2, 1, 0]
for number in countdown:
    print(number)
print("Blast off!! ðŸš€")
```

The `for` loop is a statement with five important parts:

- The word `for`, followed by a space.
- The variable name you want to create for each value in the sequence (`number`).
- The word `in`, surrounded by spaces.
- The name of the list (`countdown`, in the preceding example), or iterable that you want to loop over, followed by a colon (`:`).
- The code you want to run for each item in the iterable, separated by nested whitespace.

Let's change that code to wait for one second between each number by using the `sleep()` function:

```python
from time import sleep

countdown = [4, 3, 2, 1, 0]

for number in countdown:
    print(number)
    sleep(1)  # Wait 1 second
print("Blast off!! ðŸš€")
```

> [!NOTE]
> Most Python code uses four spaces as the unit of whitespace. To save having to press the space bar four times, most editors have a Tab key shortcut that inserts four spaces.
