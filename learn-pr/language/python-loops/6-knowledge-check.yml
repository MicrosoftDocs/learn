  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "What statement would loop over the sequence `collection` and assign the variable `item`?"
    choices:
    - content: "`for each item in collection:`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Python uses the word `for`, not `for each`."
    - content: "`for item in collection:`"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! Using `for` *variable* `in` *sequence* is the right syntax."
    - content: "`for collection in item:`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The variable to assign comes first, and `collection` comes after the `in` keyword."
  - content: "What is the correct statement to use to unpack variables named `left` and `right` from the list `turns`?"
    choices:
    - content: "`for left, right in turns:`"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! Variables are separated by commas."
    - content: "`for left and right in turns:`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Variables are separated by commas in an unpacking sequence, not the `and` keyword."
    - content: "`for [left, right] in turns:`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The variables to unpack don't need to be surrounded by brackets."
