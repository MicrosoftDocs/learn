  questions:
  - content: "Which of the following statements is incorrect?"
    choices:
    - content: "In Rust, variables are immutable by default."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Variables in Rust are immutable by default, which means their value can't be changed."
    - content: "All integer types can be either positive or negative."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Signed integers can represent positive and negative numbers, while unsigned integers can represent only positive numbers."
    - content: "Tuples can contain elements of different types."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "A tuple is a grouping of values of different types collected into one compound."
    - content: "Arrays and vectors can only hold values from a single type."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Arrays and vectors are a collection of objects that you can use to store multiple values of the same type."
  - content: "Which data structure would be the best fit for representing an address book that associates people's names to their phone numbers?"
    choices:
    - content: "A tuple"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "With a tuple, you can only group values into one compound. We could have a combined tuple of names and phone numbers but wouldn't be able to easily map them together."
    - content: "A vector"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "With a vector, you can only store a collection of objects. You wouldn't know how to relate a person's name to their phone number."
    - content: "An array"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "An array is a collection of similar objects. You wouldn't know how to relate a person's name to their phone number."
    - content: "A hash map"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. With a hash map, you can store a mapping of keys to values. So each name key could have a corresponding phone number as a value."
  - content: "What would happen if you tried to directly access an element of a vector whose index was beyond that vector's boundaries?"
    choices:
    - content: "The program would panic in runtime."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The program will panic and terminate with an 'index out of bounds' error."
    - content: "A null value would be returned."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "No value of any kind can be returned if it doesn't exist."
    - content: "A compilation error would occur."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Almost. The program will compile successfully and then return an error when the vector is accessed with an index that's not in range."
    - content: "The last element of this vector would be returned instead."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The vector won't successfully return an index that isn't specified or doesn't exist."
