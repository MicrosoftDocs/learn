Users typically modify data in a web application through a form. Since Vue.js is about working with dynamic data, it has a robust mechanism for binding data to forms. You can also manage events, performing different operations when a user clicks on a button or otherwise interacts with the page. And you even have the ability to add in values which are computed dynamically, allowing you to minimize the amount repeated code.

In this module you will learn how to:

- bind model data to a form
