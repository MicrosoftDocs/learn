  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
    - content: How would you declare a variable, holding an integer, whose value you
        want to be able to change?
      choices:
        - content: Enter the code `let number = 1`.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. You need the `mutable` keyword after the `let` keyword
            to be able to change a value.
        - content: Enter the code `let mutable number = 1`.
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: Correct. Using `mutable` is the correct way to create a variable that
            can have its value changed.
        - content: Enter the code `let mut number = 1`.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: There's no `mut` keyword. Use the `mutable` keyword instead.
    - content: What formatter would you use to format an integer?
      choices:
        - content: Use the `%s` formatter.
          explanation: Incorrect. The formatter `%s` is used to format strings.
          isCorrect: false
        - content: Use `$"{variable}"`.
          explanation: Incorrect. That's a string interpolation. What's asked for here is
            a formatter for a data type.
          isCorrect: false
        - content: Use the `%i` formatter.
          explanation: Correct. That's the correct formatter to use.
          isCorrect: true
    - content: What's the correct operator for equality?
      choices:
        - content: The correct operator to use is `=`.
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: Correct. That's the correct operator to use.
        - content: The correct operator to use is `<>`.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. That operator means "not equal to."
        - content: The correct operator to use is `==`.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. There's only one equal sign for equality.
