F# is an open-source, cross-platform programming language that makes it easy to write succinct, performant, robust, and practical code. An important goal with programs you write is being able to work on input, process the input, and output it. In this module, you'll learn concepts and perform tasks that teach you how to work with variables, input, and output.

## What you'll be doing

In this module, you'll:

- Declare and use variables to store values.
- Output to the screen.
- Read from the console and capture user input.
- Convert between data types.

## Prerequisites

- Familiarity with how to set up your F# development environment, covered in [Take your first steps with F#](/training/modules/fsharp-first-steps/?azure-portal=true).
