As you've seen, error handling and logging in Go are different from other programming languages. First, Go's approach to error handling is straightforward. The convention uses an `if` condition, and the function that you're calling should return multiple values. Conventionally, the last returned value is the error. If the error variable comes `nil`, it means that there's no error. However, if the value is `non-nil`, it means that there's a failure. You could propagate the error up to the stack by only returning the error again, and you could include more context if you need to.

You could also create error variables that you can reuse as a return value for common error messages in your programs. You also need to know when to panic. We already covered how to panic and recover works, and they should be used only when you explicitly need your program to crash. There might be times when your program will crash even if you're handling errors properly, but that should be the exception, not the rule.

Lastly, we explored how logging works in Go, and you saw how to use the standard library. Besides printing out logs to the console, you could send logs to a file for processing logs later and send them to a centralized location. Additionally, when your codebase grows, you might need to do other things like setting log levels or configure different outputs. This is not supported in the standard library. Therefore you'll need to use a logging framework like Zerolog.

Although this was a short module, make sure you understood all the concepts really well, as this will become very helpful when you need to troubleshoot problems in your programs.
