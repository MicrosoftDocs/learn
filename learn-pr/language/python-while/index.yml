title: Iterate through code blocks by using the while statement
summary: Use the `while` statement and related Python code constructs to add looping logic to your programs.
abstract: |
  In this module, you will:
  - Use the `while` statement to iterate through a code block.
  - Use the `break`, `continue`, and `else` statements to further control iteration.
  - Use alternate assignment operators to perform mathematical operations that also assign values.
prerequisites: |
  - You should have your Python development environment set up, know how to create a working folder and code files, and know how to execute the code in a code file.
  - You should understand data types like `str` and `int` and know how to define, set, and get values from a variable.
  - You should understand what a code block is and how to define one.
  - You should understand how to include a module from the Python Standard Library.
  - Experience using if statements and the string's `isnumeric()` helper method to evaluate user input.
