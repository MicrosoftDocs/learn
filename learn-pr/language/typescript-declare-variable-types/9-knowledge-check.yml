  Choose the best response for each of the following questions. Then select **Check your answers**.
quiz:
  questions:
  - content: "The `boolean`, `number`, `string`, and `enum` types are examples of which category of subtype of `any`?"
    choices:
    - content: "Type parameters."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Type parameters are their own subtype under the `any` type."
    - content: "Object types."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Object types are their own subtype under `any` and include classes, interfaces, arrays, and literal types."
    - content: "Primitive types."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! The `boolean`, `number`, `string`, and `enum` types are examples of the primitive subtype of the `any` type."
  - content: "Which of the following types is an example of an object type?"
    choices:
    - content: "`Array`."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! `Array` is an example of an object type."
    - content: "`void`."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. `void` is an example of a primitive type."
    - content: "Type parameters."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Type parameters are their own subtype under the `any` type."
  - content: "What is the primary difference between the `any` and `unknown` types?"
    choices:
    - content: "You can assign any value to `unknown`, but the `any` type has some constraints."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. There are no constraints when using the `any` type."
    - content: "You can access the properties of an `unknown` type but not an `any` type."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. You can't access any properties, or call or construct them, when using the `unknown` type."
    - content: "You can access the properties of an `any` type but not an `unknown` type."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! You can access any properties, and call or construct them, when using the `any` type."
  - content: "What is the name of the feature in TypeScript that tells the compiler *I know what I'm doing*?"
    choices:
    - content: "Literal narrowing."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Literal narrowing is process of going from an infinite number of potential cases to a smaller, finite number of potential cases."
    - content: "Type assertion."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! A type assertion tells TypeScript that you've performed any special checks that you need before calling the statement."
    - content: "Type guard."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A type guard examines the type of an expression at runtime."
  - content: "What is a Tuple?"
    choices:
    - content: "An array with an infinite number of elements of the same type."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This is the definition of a standard array."
    - content: "An array with specific number of elements of the same type."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While a Tuple might contain elements of the same type, this isn't required. All elements can be a different type."
    - content: "An array with a specific number of elements of one or more types."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! A Tuple is an array that has a specific number of elements. Each element is of a specific type and must appear in the exact same order when values are assigned to it."
