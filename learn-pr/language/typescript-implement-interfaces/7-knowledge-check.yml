  Choose the best response for each of the questions below. Then select **Check your answers**.
quiz:
  questions:
  - content: "What is the primary job of an interface?"
    choices:
    - content: "Define the implementation details for an object."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A function or class that implements the interface are responsible for the implementation details."
    - content: "Describe the properties and return types of an object."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! An interface describes the properties and return types, while a function or class defines the implementation details."
    - content: "Fulfill the code contract for an object."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A function or class that implements the interface are responsible for fulfilling the code contract for an object."
  - content: "How can you prevent the type system from raising an error when a property in an interface is omitted?"
    choices:
    - content: "Make the property optional."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! Optional properties may be omitted without raising an error."
    - content: "Make the property required."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. TypeScript will raise an error when a required property is omitted."
    - content: "Make the property read only."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. TypeScript will raise an error when a read-only property is omitted, unless it is also optional."
  - content: "What happens when you extend one interface with another interface?"
    choices:
    - content: "Multiple interfaces can have the same property if the property has the exact same name."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Multiple interfaces can have the same property if the property has the exact same name, but they must also be the same type."
    - content: "If two interfaces have a property with the same name but different types, TypeScript ignores the property completely."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. If the property has the same name but different type, you must declare a new property such that the resulting property is a subtype of both interfaces."
    - content: "You must implement all the required properties from all interfaces."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! Any required properties in any of the interfaces must be implemented in the combined interface."
