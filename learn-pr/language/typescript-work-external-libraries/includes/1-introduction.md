TypeScript provides two ways to organize you code: Namespaces and modules. While both provide a way to categorize related code in meaningful ways and help you control which code is exposed to the global namespace of your applications, there are some differences between them. This module introduces you to modules in TypeScript (referred to as external modules in previous versions.) 

In addition to modules, you can import other external libraries containing type definitions that you can take advantage of in your code.

## Learning objectives

- Organize code using modules.
- Import an external type library.

## Prerequisites

- Knowledge of TypeScript
- Familiarity with JavaScript
- Familiarity with modules in JavaScript
- Installed software:
  - [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
  - [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)
  - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
  - TypeScript - TypeScript can be installed after installing Node.js after running the following in a terminal or command window:

      ```bash
      npm install -g typescript
      ```

For best results, follow the complete instructions for setting up your environment and using the TypeScript compiler in [LINK TO Module 01: Get started with TypeScript ]. After setting up your environment, you can run any of the Lab setup or solution files in the "Developing JavaScript applications using TypeScript" [LINK TO the Developing JavaScript applications using TypeScript] learning path.
