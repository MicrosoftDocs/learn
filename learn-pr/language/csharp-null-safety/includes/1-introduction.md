In this module, you'll gain an understanding of nullability in C#. You'll use null-state analysis and compiler warnings to check code for null safety.

## Example scenario

Suppose you're an employee of a pizza company named Contoso Pizza. Your manager has asked you to maintain an existing .NET console app that's part of the ordering system. You've decided to enforce *null safety* in the app using nullable reference types.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you'll:

- Learn how to configure the nullable context of your C# project or code.
- Use a nullable-enabled context to perform automatic static flow analysis.
- Understand the different ways in which you can declare nullable types.
- Learn how and when to use various null-related C# operators:
  - null-forgiving (`!`) operator
  - null-coalescing (`??`) operator
  - null-conditional (`?.`) operator
