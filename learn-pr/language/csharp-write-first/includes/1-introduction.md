The C# programming language allows you to build many types of applications, like:

- business applications to capture, analyze, and process data
- dynamic web applications that can be accessed from a web browser
- games, both 2D and 3D
- financial and scientific applications
- cloud-based applications
- mobile applications

But how do you get started?

By far, the best way to learn how to code is to *write* as much code as possible. So, we encourage you to type along with the exercises in this module and the others in this learning path. Typing the code yourself in each exercise and solving small coding challenges will accelerate your learning.

Furthermore, you need to begin learning small foundational concepts and build on them with continual practice and exploration.

In this module, you will:
  - Write your first lines of C# code
  - Use two different techniques to print a message to a text console
  - Diagnose errors when you type code incorrectly
  - Identify different C# syntax elements like operators, classes, and methods

By the end of this module, you'll be able to write C# code to print a message to a text console, like the Windows Command Prompt.  These lines of code will give you your first look at the C# syntax and immediately provide invaluable insights. In fact, this module will introduce many new ideas, which will be expanded on in other modules.
