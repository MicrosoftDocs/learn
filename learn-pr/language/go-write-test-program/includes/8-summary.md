What a ride! We've come to the end of learning the fundamentals in Go, and you've been writing several programs to practice. Now you're equipped to continue your learning journey in Go and start writing more complex programs. For several topics, like concurrency, we just scratched the surface and didn't go too far in-depth. So we suggest you go deeper to understand how to write better code, that is easy to change, and that runs fast.

As you've seen, Go is very idiomatic in certain things like concurrency, error handling, the use of frameworks, and more. So there were times when you might have had to forget what you knew from other programming languages to understand why Go decides to implement things in a certain way. For instance, Go is not an OOP language, but many of OOP features can be implemented in Go.

A final recommendation from us is that you continue practicing, going back through the exercises you've done through and extending them. And above all, don't make any assumptions, write a test case, and probe any hypothesis you might have about Go.
