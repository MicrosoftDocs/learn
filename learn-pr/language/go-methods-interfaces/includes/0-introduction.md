Object-oriented programming (OOP) it's a popular programming paradigm that most programming languages support, at least partially. Go is no exception, even though it doesn't fully support all of the OOP principles. At this point, we've covered enough topics that you'll need to implement principles like encapsulation and composition.

Additionally, we'll cover how interfaces work in Go and why they're different from other programming languages, mainly because Go doesn't support inheritance. Interfaces in Go are implicit, and in this module, you'll see how this works.

This module covers two crucial topics in Go: methods and interfaces. When you finish this module, you'll be able to read and understand other's code like the one from the open-source community.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you'll learn about:

- How Go implements OOP principles like encapsulation and composition
- How to write methods and why you'll use them
- How to write embedding and overloading methods
- How to write and use interfaces, and why they're different from other programming languages

## Prerequisites

- A Go environment ready to create applications. Ideally, you should have installed and configured Go locally and [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download?azure-portal=true) with the [Go extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=golang.Go&azure-portal=true) installed.
- Be able to create and modify `.go` files
- Be able to run Go applications using the terminal prompt
- Have knowledge of basic data types like `string`, `int`, and `boolean`
- Have knowledge of how to write basic data control flows like `if` and `for` statements
- Have knowledge of how to write functions
- Have knowledge of how to create structs
