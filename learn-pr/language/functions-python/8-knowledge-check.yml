  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "Can a function that defines arguments be called without arguments?"
    choices:
    - content: "No, because defined arguments are required."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! When a function declares arguments, they are required."
    - content: "Yes, because they're optional."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Defined arguments in a function aren't optional."
    - content: "Yes, as long as there's a return value."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Although some functions define a return value, defined arguments are required regardless."
  - content: "Can a function with only keyword arguments be called without any arguments?"
    choices:
    - content: "Yes, because keyword arguments are optional when calling a function."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! Keyword arguments already define defaults, which allows calling a function without them."
    - content: "No, because you must pass values so that the function can work."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. If a function has only keyword arguments, there's no need to pass any values."
    - content: "No, because it needs arguments."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A function that only defines keyword arguments doesn't require arguments."
  - content: "Can a function define arguments and keyword arguments?"
    choices:
    - content: "No, only arguments or keyword arguments are allowed."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Python allows both to work together."
    - content: "Yes, but only if keyword arguments are defined before arguments."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Python requires arguments to be defined before keyword arguments."
    - content: "Yes, but only if arguments are defined before keyword arguments."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! As long as arguments come in first, a function can be defined with both."
  - content: "What is the minimum number of arguments that a function can accept when you're using variable arguments?"
    choices:
    - content: "Zero. There's no need to pass any argument at all when you're using variable arguments."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! Variable arguments don't have a required minimum number."
    - content: "At least one argument is needed because arguments in functions are required."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Although arguments require values, variable arguments don't need to be passed into a function."
    - content: "At least one argument is needed unless it's a keyword argument."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Although a keyword argument is optional, there's no need to pass any argument when you're using variable arguments."
  - content: "What is the syntax to declare variable arguments and variable keyword arguments?"
    choices:
    - content: "`args, kwargs`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Although this syntax is commonly used as placeholder for variable arguments and keyword arguments, these arguments must use the asterisk."
    - content: "`*a, *kw`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Although this syntax correctly defines variable arguments, the variable keyword arguments need two asterisks instead of one."
    - content: "`*args, **kwargs`"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! Although the placeholder name can change, you must use a single asterisk for variable arguments and double asterisks for variable keyword arguments."
