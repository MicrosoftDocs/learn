In this module, you learned:

- How to differentiate between packages, crates and modules.
- How to organize your code in many modules.
- How to split your modules between different files.
- How to use third party crates from [Crates.io](https://crates.io?azure-portal=true).

In the next module we are going to take a deep dive in the world of automated tests in Rust.
