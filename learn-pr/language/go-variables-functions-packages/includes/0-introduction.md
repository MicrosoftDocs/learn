In the previous module, you configured a Go environment to create and run programs written in Go. You also learned the basics of a Go program's coding structure and how to compile and run an application.

In this module, you'll take a step forward by learning the basic data types available in Go and organizing the code you write in a `.go` file by using functions. You'll also learn how to manage and write programs in different files under the same package. Finally, you'll learn how to create and use packages in Go.
