We've covered the basics of what you need to start building more complex applications in Go. By now, you know how different ways to declare and initialize variables, the various data types Go provides, and you've used the most basic ones.

Additionally, you've learned how to create functions to organize your code and make it more maintainable. You've learned that Go is a "pass by value" language, but it also has support for using pointers, which we'll use in some of the upcoming modules.

Lastly, you learned how packages work in Go and how to create modules when you want to share your code with other developers. You also learned that if you only need to create a standalone application, all your code needs to be part of the `main` package, and the starting point of that program is the `main()` function. Moreover, you understand now how to reference local and third-party modules, which you're going to be using a lot when building Go programs.
