  - content: "What will be the result of the following line of code? `Console.WriteLine(5 / 10);`"
    choices:
    - content: "0.5"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "While 5 / 10 does equal 0.5, since we're using `int` literals, C# will represent them differently."

      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "You may have mistakenly swapped the dividend and divisor."
    - content: "0"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct!"
    - content: "1"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Since `5` and `10` are `int` literals, dividing them would normally equal `0.5`, however the `.5` would be truncated."

    choices:
    - content: "`value += 5;`"
      isCorrect: true

      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This line of code doesn't use the *addition assignment* operator."
    - content: "value = value + 5;"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This line of code doesn't use the *addition assignment* operator."
