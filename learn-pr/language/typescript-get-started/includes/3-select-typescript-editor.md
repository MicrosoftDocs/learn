You can write TypeScript code in any text editor or IDE of your choice.

In this exercise, you'll learn about your options and then setup Visual Studio Code so you can complete the remaining exercises in this course.

## The Playground

Earlier, you wrote some simple TypeScript code in the [Playground](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play?azure-portal=true). The Playground is a place where you can write, share, and learn TypeScript. You can use it to:

- Learn TypeScript in a place where nothing can break.
- Experiment with TypeScript syntax and share the URLs with others.
- Experiment with the different compiler features of TypeScript.

In this course, we'll occasionally visit the Playground to try out new TypeScript concepts.

## Integrated Development Editors (IDEs)

For more full-featured TypeScript editing and tools, there are [many IDEs that support TypeScript](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/TypeScript-Editor-Support?azure-portal=true) or have plugins or tooling packages developed to support it. In this module, we will use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com?azure-portal=true), however you are free to use whatever editor you prefer.

### Install Visual Studio Code

Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is a free, lightweight source code editor that runs on your desktop on the macOS, Linux, and Windows operating systems. It comes with built-in support for JavaScript, TypeScript, and Node.js and has a rich ecosystem of extensions for other languages and runtimes.

To install VS Code:

1. Open the [Visual Studio Code download](https://code.visualstudio.com/download?azure-portal=true) page and select the download option for your operating system.
2. If you need additional setup guidance, visit the installation page for your operating system:
    - [Linux](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/linux?azure-portal=true)
    - [macOS](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/mac?azure-portal=true)
    - [Windows](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/windows?azure-portal=true)

Now that you have a code editor, you're ready to install TypeScript.
