## Prerequisites

- HTML/CSS
- JavaScript
- Git
- npm
- Some experience with React

## Summary

The goal of React components is to create reusable blocks of code and UI. To support reusability you can pass data into components through the use of properties. We will see how to add properties to a component, and work with complex data types such as arrays.

## Learning objectives

1. Add props to components
2. Incorporate logic into JSX
3. Use map to display data in arrays

## Chunk your content into subtasks

Identify the subtasks of *module title*

| Subtask | What part of the introduction scenario does this subtask satisfy? | How will you assess it: **Exercise or Knowledge check**? | Which learning objective(s) does this help meet? | Does the subtask have enough learning content to justify an entire unit? If not, which other subtask will you combine it with? |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Add props to components | Add props to components | Exercise | Add props to components | Yes |
| Incorporate logic into JSX | Incorporate logic into JSX | Exercise | Incorporate logic into JSX | Yes |
| Use map to display data in arrays | Use map to display data in arrays | Exercise | Use map to display data in arrays | Yes |

## Outline the units

1. **Overview of components**

    Components can be used to break complex application into smaller reusable blocks. While it is possible to allow components to be completely self-contained, it's typically desirable to make them dynamic by passing data into them. We will explore how to create dynamic components, and incorporate logic.

1. **Introducing props**

    - Add props to components
        - What are props?
        - How props work in React
        - Passing prop values into components

1. **Exercise - Adding props to a component**

    1. Clone the starter repository
    2. Create a new component
    3. Add props
    4. Add the code to call the component
    5. Pass values into the component props

1. **Working with logic in JSX files**

    - Incorporate logic into JSX
      - Explore how you can use JavaScript in JSX files
      - Examine adding boolean logic

1. **Exercise - Using complex data types as props**

    1. Add CSS to the component
    2. Update props to use an object
    3. Add logic to change colors conditionally
    4. Pass object into component
    5. Save all files to see the results

1. **Using map to display data inside an array**

    - Use map to display data inside array
      - Introduce the map function
      - Demonstrate how map works with JSX

1. **Exercise - Display list data**

    1. Create a CSS file
    2. Create a new component
    3. Add code to display list
    4. Update application to use new component
    5. Save all files to see the results

1. **Challenge**

    - Add new component to test understanding of props and map

1. **Summary**

    We explored how to create a component with properties. We added both a complex object and an array. We then added logic to display information dynamically.

1. **Knowledge check**
