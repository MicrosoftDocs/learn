You've seen how to create custom components and display content dynamically. Test your skills by adding a new component to display the steps for the recipe. The steps should be displayed as part of an ordered list (`ol`).

The recipe steps are as follows:

1. Add cut potatoes to a pot of heavily salted water.
2. Bring pot to a boil.
3. Boil the potatoes until fork tender, about 15-20 minutes.
4. Strain the potatoes.
5. Return potatoes to pot.
6. Add butter, cream, salt, and pepper to taste.
7. Mash potatoes.
8. Reseason and add butter and cream as desired.
