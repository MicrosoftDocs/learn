  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "Which statement is false?"
    choices:
    - content: "All variables are of string data type by default."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "This is a false statement.  A variable can point to values in memory that are of many different data types."
    - content: "The print() function can work with several data types, including string, int, float, and others."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This is a true statement."
    - content: "You use the same symbol for both addition and concatenation, and Python will understand which to perform based on the two values' data types."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This is a true statement."
    - content: "You must convert integer values to string values before performing string concatenation."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This is a true statement."
  - content: "You want to create a new variable to hold the count of items in inventory on hand.  Which of the following variable names would be your best choice?"
    choices:
    - content: "inventory_count_on_hand"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "While the variable name `inventory_count_on_hand` satisfies many aspects of Python's guidance on naming variables, there's a shorter option available that would likely suffice."
    - content: "inventoryCountOnHand"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The Python naming convention suggests using all lowercase letters, separating each word with an underscore.  There's a better variable name choice you can make."
    - content: "inventory_count"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "This two-word variable name adequately describes the value it is storing, and it uses the underscore character to separate the two words."
    - content: "inv-ct"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This option uses odd contractions for the words 'inventory' and 'count,' it uses a dash instead of an underscore, and it's difficult to read.  There's a better variable name choice you can make."
  - content: "What is the purpose of the opening and closing parentheses next to a function name?"
    choices:
    - content: "They define the order of operations, as they do in math."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Although you'll soon learn that a set of parentheses can be used to define the order of operations, they do not serve this purpose when they're used next to a function name."
    - content: "Parentheses are the function invocation operators that instruct Python to execute the function."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct!  Without parentheses, you're merely referencing the name of the function, not instructing Python what to do with it."
    - content: "They instruct Python to return a value."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Calling a function can return a value, but this isn't the purpose of parentheses."
    - content: "They instruct Python to display content to output."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The `print()` function displays content to output, and you can pass values to the function that you want to display between the parentheses. However, that's not their purpose."
