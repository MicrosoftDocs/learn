The following code is one possible solution to the challenge from the previous unit.

```python
print("Today's date?")
date = input()
print("Breakfast calories?")
breakfast = int(input())
print("Lunch calories?")
lunch = int(input())
print("Dinner calories?")
dinner = int(input())
print("Snack calories?")
snack = int(input())
total = breakfast + lunch + dinner + snack
print("Calorie content for " + date + ": " + str(total))
```

This code is merely *one possible solution*. You might have chosen different variable names, or you might have attempted to perform the addition operation on the last line of the code. However, you should have used variables, the `print()` function, the `input()` function, string concatenation, addition, and so on, to produce the desired output.

Again, your actual output might be different, depending on the values you entered at each prompt.

```output
Today's date?
December 7th, 2020
Breakfast calories?
250
Lunch calories?
300
Dinner calories?
500
Snack calories?
150
Calorie content for December 7th, 2020: 1200
```

If you're successful, congratulations!  Continue on to the knowledge check in the next unit.
