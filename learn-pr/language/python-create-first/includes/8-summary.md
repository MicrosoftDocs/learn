Our goal in this module was to build a program that both accepts input from the user and displays information to the user.

By using basic Python syntax, you wrote programs that prompt a user to enter data, store the data in variables, and combine it with literal string data to display a new message to the user.  You used Visual Studio Code to help create code files, identify potential errors, and execute your code.  You learned about functions, variables, comments, data types, and other code constructs to realize the programs that you design in your imagination.

Although the applications that you built might seem mundane at first, you're just getting started.  There's much more to learn.  Don't give up!  You can do it!  Take consistent, daily baby steps to add to your knowledge little by little each day.
