quiz:
  questions:
  - content: Which one of the following statements is true?
    choices:
    - content: Vue applications must make an external call to a back-end server that hosts a database application.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A Vue application can use a back-end server and database, but it doesn't necessarily have to. Vue allows you to build powerful single-page applications on the front end in an HTML web browser."
    - content: To create a Vue application, you must rewrite your existing framework.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. Vue is a progressive application. It can be added to any existing framework and implemented in a progressive way. You can start with simple functionality and continue to build a more complex application, as needed.
    - content: You can implement a Vue application by entering a simple script tag in an HTML document that references the Vue core library.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. You don't need external tools or an external server to build a powerful single-page application in an HTML web browser. You can script the Vue application details within the HTML page, or you can link the page to a JavaScript file that contains the Vue application code."
  - content: Which of the following options represents the correct way to dynamically bind an attribute to an expression within an HTML interface?
    choices:
    - content: "<img :src=''selected_prod_img'''>"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Placing the data object name within curly braces *is* the correct way to tell Vue to print the data within an HTML tag. But you must use the v-bind directive to bind application data to an attribute for an HTML tag. Include a colon (`:`) between v-bind and the name of the attribute, or use the colon by itself as a form of Vue shorthand notation."
    - content: "<img v-bind src=''selected_prod_img'''>"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The v-bind directive does dynamically bind an attribute to an expression, but a colon (`:`) must separate v-bind from the name of the attribute."
    - content: "<img src=''{{ selected_prod_img }}''>"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Placing the data object name within curly braces *is* the correct way to tell Vue to print the data inside an HTML tag. But you must use the v-bind directive to bind application data to an attribute for an HTML tag." 
  - content: Which one of the following statements correctly describes how Vue.js lets you manage style and class bindings?
    choices:
    - content: "Vue allows you to use shorthand notation for `v-on` directives. But you can't use shorthand for `v-bind` when you apply class and style bindings."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Vue allows you to use shorthand notation for `v-on` directives and all `v-bind` directives."
    - content: You can apply multiple style and class bindings simultaneously on one HTML element.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct! Well done.
    - content: "To add several style properties to an HTML element, you need to apply `v-bind` directives by using separate in-line styles."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. You can bind to an entire class of styles, including properties that are defined in your application.
