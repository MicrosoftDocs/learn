    "Python provides common arithmetic operators so you can perform mathematic operations in your code. These include the four core operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n",

    "Let's explore how we can create a program that can calculate the distance between two planets. We'll start by using two planet distances: Earth (149,597,870 km) and Jupiter (778,547,200 km).\n",
    "\n",
    "This exercise is broken into a series of steps. For each step you will be presented with the goal for the step, followed by an empty cell. Enter your Python into the cell and run it. The solution for each step will follow each cell.\n",

    "**Note:** Remove the commas when you're using the values.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Create variables to store the distances\n",
    "\n",
    "Start by creating two variables named `first_planet` and `second_planet`. Set `first_planet` to the distance from the sun to Earth, and `second_planet` for the distance from the sun to Jupiter."
