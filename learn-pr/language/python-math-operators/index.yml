title: Use mathematical operations in Python
summary: Almost every application a developer creates involves some level of math. This module explores the core functionality in Python and arithmetic operators. You'll also explore how to perform more manipulations of data and numbers. You'll put this knowledge to use to create a project to determine the distance between planets.
abstract: | 
  By the end of this module, you'll be able to:
  - Use arithmetic operators in Python.
  - Determine the order of operations.
  - Convert strings to numbers.
prerequisites: | 
  - Ability to add and run cells in a Jupyter notebook.
  - Experience with Python, including declaring variables and using `input` to read values from a user.
