In this module, you learned:

- How can a Rust program can be halted in face of unrecoverable errors with `panic!`.
- How to represent the possibility of absence of values with the `Option` enum.
- How to represent operations the `Result` enum.
- About pattern matching and how it can safely access all possible values of a given type.

In the next module in this Learning Path, you'll discover one of Rust's most novel aspect, the *Borrow Checker*, and will learn about how it can prevent many types of bugs in our code.
