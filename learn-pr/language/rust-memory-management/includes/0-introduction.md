In this module we are going to discover one of Rust's most powerful features: the Borrow Checker.

It enables Rust to make memory safety guarantees without needing a garbage collector, unlike many other languages.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you will learn about:

- Rust's pointer types, commonly called References.
- The concept of ownership in Rust.
- Moving and borrowing values.
- Scoping rules and Lifetimes.

## Prerequisites

- You should have a basic understanding of Rust's primitive and collection types, as covered in the previous modules.
