# Summary

In this module, you learned:

- How values are passed around via moves, borrows, and immutable borrows.
- How the Borrow Checker prevents Rust code from having data races and dangling pointers.
- What lifetimes are and how they tell the compiler about the duration of our program's values.

In the next module in this Learning Path, you'll discover how Rust deals with polymorphism using Generic Types and Traits.
