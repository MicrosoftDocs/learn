Throughout these learning modules, code challenges like this one reinforce what you've learned and help you gain confidence before you continue.

## Step 1 - Add a new file for this challenge 

Use the techniques that you learned in previous modules to add a new code file. Add it to the folder that's dedicated to this module.  For example, you might create a file named *challenge1.py*.

## Step 2 - Create a list for a standard deck of cards

Use the technique from the previous unit to list every combination of suit and rank in a set of 52 cards.  Instead of just printing the value of the card, add the card to a list that represents a deck of cards.

When you finish, display the number of cards in the deck by using the function that provides a count of items in the list.

```output
There are 52 cards in the deck.
```

## Step 3 - Randomly choose five cards to add to a player's hand

Next, create a second list for the results of a deal. To simulate the dealing of five random cards, use the appropriate method to choose a card.  Add the card to the list that represents the player's hand. Remove the card from the list that represents the deck.

Before you simulate the deal, print this message:

```output
Dealing ...
```

After you simulate the deal, print out the number of cards in the list that represents the deck.  Finally, print out the cards in the player's hand.

When the process is complete, you should see something like the following output. Your output will differ because the cards are dealt randomly.

```output
There are 52 cards in the deck.
Dealing ...
There are 47 cards in the deck.
Player has the following cards in their hand:
['Jack of Hearts', 'Queen of Hearts', '4 of Spades', 'Ace of Hearts', '9 of Diamonds']
```
