Although web developers build their websites by using tools such as Node.js, ASP.NET, or Java, and run their code locally by using tooling in code editors such as Visual Studio Code, Python developers have some other tools at their disposal.

One of those useful tools is called a *notebook*. A notebook is an interactive environment that a developer can use to run code blocks and add areas for documentation to explain the code itself. Although Python developers can also use *.py* files to run Python programs directly, they can use notebooks to both run and document their code, explaining its logic along the way.

## Scenario: Crew member on ISS

Suppose you are a crew member on a spaceship. Your mission is to deliver some important equipment to the International Space Station (ISS). If you're not familiar with some of the many buttons on the spaceship's console, it's better not to learn by the trial-and-error method, mid-flight! Instead, you might consult the ship's documentation to learn what buttons to push to perform various tasks. But what if the manual is incomplete?

Your job is to improve the ship's manual by creating interactive explanations of the ship's controls. By working with a notebook, you can more easily explain the uses of the various parts of the console.

## What will you learn?

By the end of this module, you'll be able to:

- Create a Jupyter notebook locally.
- Run a Jupyter notebook by using Python in Visual Studio Code.
- Describe some of the ways to build a notebook.

## What is the main goal?

Take advantage of notebooks as a tool to create a more interactive learning experience.
