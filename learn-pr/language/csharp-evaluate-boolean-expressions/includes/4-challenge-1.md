Code challenges throughout these modules will reinforce what you've learned and help you gain some confidence before continuing on.

## Heads or tails challenge

In this challenge, you'll flip a coin to display either `heads` or `tails`. This is a perfect scenario for the conditional operator.

> [!NOTE]
> If you haven't followed along with these C# learning paths sequentially, take a moment to familiarize yourself with the `Random` class and its `Next()` method by reviewing the unit [Calling different kinds of methods in the .NET Class Library](/training/modules/csharp-call-methods/3-call-methods?azure-portal=true).

### Step 1 - Delete all of the code in the .NET Editor from the earlier exercise

Select all of the code in the .NET Editor, then select the `del` or `backspace` key to delete it.

### Step 2 - Write code in the .NET Editor to display the result of a coin flip

Use the `Random` class to generate a value. Based on the value, use the conditional operator to display either `heads` or `tails`.  

There should be a 50% chance that the result is either heads or tails.

You should be able to accomplish the desired result in three lines of code or less.
