    choices:
    - content: "`Console.WriteLine(value == false);`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Evaluating for `false` isn't logical negation."

      explanation: "Correct!"
    - content: "`Console.WriteLine(value != true);`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Evaluating that value isn't `true` isn't logical negation."

    - content: "`int value = amount >= 10 ? 10 | 20;`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The pipe character isn't correct for use in the conditional operator."
