In this module, you first covered the topic of collections. There are three main collections lists, sequences, and arrays. Each type of collection has their own pros and cons. 

We then focused on lists and list properties. Lists are implemented as linked lists which facilities accessing items at the start of the list but also using a zero based index.

Then we focused on operation in the list module that allows you to do things like iterating, mathematical operations, sorting and more.
