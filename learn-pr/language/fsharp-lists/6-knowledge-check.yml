  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
    - content: You're operating on a list, where each item has the properties `City` and `Country`. To display the two properties concatenated, what list function would you use?
      choices:
        - content: The `sum()` function
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. The `sum()` function sums a list of numbers. You're looking for a transformation, so `map()` is the correct answer.
        - content: The `iter()` function
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. The `iter()` function iterates over each element without transforming it. You need to transform `City` and `Country` into one property, so `map()` is the correct answer.
        - content: The `map()` function
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: Correct. The `map()` function transforms two properties into one `List.map(fun item -> item.City + item.Country )`.
    - content: Given the list `let list = [1;2;3;4]`, what will the `Head` property return?
      choices:
        - content: It returns `[2;3;4]`.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. That's the tail part of the list.
        - content: It returns `1`. 
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: Correct. `Head` returns the first element of the list, which has the value `1`.
        - content: It returns `4`. 
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. The element `4` is the last one in the list. `Head` returns the first element in the list, which has the value `1`.
    - content: What is the correct way to return the average value from a list?
      choices: 
        - content: Use `let list = [2;4]`, and calculate the average value by using `let average = List.average list`.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. The numbers need to be floating point, so you need to transform the values by using `let avg = list |> List.map(fun x -> float x) |> List.average` or by using a list with floating point numbers `let list = [2.0; 4.0]`.
        - content: Use `let list = [2.0; 4.0]`, and calculate the average value by using `let average = List.avg list`.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. The function is called `average()` not `avg()`.
        - content: Use `let list = [2.0; 4.0]`, and calculate the average value by using `let average = List.average list`.
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: Correct. You need the list to consist of floating point numbers and use the `average()` function.
