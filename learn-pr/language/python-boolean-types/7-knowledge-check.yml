  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "Under what conditions does a test expression that uses the `and` operator evaluate to `True`?"
    choices:
    - content: "A test expression that uses the `and` operator evaluates to `True` when both subexpressions are true."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! Both conditions in the test expression must be true for the entire test expression to evaluate to `true`. "
    - content: "A test expression that uses the `and` operator evaluates to `True` when one subexpression is true and the other is false."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This answer is true for the `or` operator, but not the `and` operator."
    - content: "A test expression that uses the `and` operator evaluates to `True` when both subexpressions are false."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. If a test expression uses the `and` operator and both subexpressions are false, the value of the whole test expression evaluates to `False`."
  - content: "What is the keyword `elif` short for in Python?"
    choices:
    - content: "else if"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! You can use the `elif` keyword to add multiple test expressions to your program."
    - content: "only if"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. If you want to run a code block only if a certain condition is true, you might use an `if` statement."
    - content: "else"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. `else` is a separate keyword in Python."
  - content: "What values in a test expression are always interpreted as false?"
    choices:
    - content: "Any non-zero values"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Some non-zero values might be false, depending on the test expression."
    - content: "Empty"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Empty is not a valid Python value."
    - content: "None and 0"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! None and 0 are interpreted as false in Python."
