In this module, you explored how to use Vue.js to dynamically change the display. You saw how to use the directives `v-for`, `v-show`, `v-if`, `v-else-if`, and `v-else`.

You learned how to:

- Render all items in an array.
- Show or hide HTML elements based on variable values.
- Use if, else, and else-if statements in Vue.js.
