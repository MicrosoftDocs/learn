At this point, you already know how Go differs from other programming languages. For instance, Go doesn't require you to write parenthesis in conditions for `if`, `for`, or `switch` statements. However, you always need to write braces (`{}`). You can chain `if` statements, and an `else` clause is optional. Moreover, a crucial aspect is that you can declare variables within an `if` condition, and its scope are only within the `if` block. You can't access those variables outside of it, even in the same function.

Go also has support for `switch` statements, and you don't have to write a condition. You can simply have `case` clauses. Moreover, unlike other languages, you don't need to write a `break` statement at the end of each `case` clause to avoid running other `case` clauses. By default, when Go enters into a `case` statement, execute it, and exits the `switch` clause. However, if you want to jump to the next `case` clause, you can do it through the `fallthrough` keyword. You can call a function from a `case` clause, and you can have group multiple expressions in one `case` clause.

You also learned that in Go, you only have the `for` keyword to write loops. Nevertheless, you can write infinite loops or `while` conditions. Additionally, Go has support for the `continue` keyword, and it's useful when you need to skip an iteration of the loop, but you don't want to exit from it.

Lastly, you learned about other control flows in Go like the `defer`, `panic`, and `recover` functions. Go doesn't have support for exceptions, and its idiomatic way of dealing with runtime errors is by using a combination of these three functions.
