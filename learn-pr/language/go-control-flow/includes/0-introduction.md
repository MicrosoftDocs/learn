In the previous module, you learned the basics of Go regarding data types, variables, constants, functions, and packages. Now that you know how to structure the logic of a program and how Go prefers to organize the code, let's see how fundamental control flows like `if/else`, `switches`, `for`, and another set of keywords that will help to write programs the Go way.

If you have previous experience in a programming language that follows most of the C syntax like C# or Java, a few sections in this module will be pretty straightforward. However, there are going to be certain sections and specific nuances that are very different in Go.

Almost at the end of the module, you'll find a challenge where you need to apply all the concepts you've learned so far. We'll provide the solution to the challenge so that you compare it with your resolution.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you will:

- Learn about simple and compound `if` statements
- Learn about `switch` statements and its different features
- Learn about loop statements and its patterns in Go using the `for` keyword
- Learn about essential functions you'll use to handle errors like `defer`, `panic`, and `recover`

## Prerequisites

- A Go environment ready to create applications. Ideally, you should have installed and configured Go locally and VS Code with the Go extension installed. Alternatively, you could use the Go Playground.
- Know how to create and modify `.go` files
- Know how run Go applications using the terminal prompt
- Know how to declare and initialize variables
- Know how to create functions
