In this module, you became familiar with concepts for creating a Python program.

You were introduced to the `print()` function, which lets you show output on the console. Then you looked at variables and how to use them to store values that you want to use later in the code. You learned that a variable must have a type. There are various types in Python that let you store strings, numbers, and Boolean values.

You also looked at operators used for arithmetic operations and for assigning values to operators.
