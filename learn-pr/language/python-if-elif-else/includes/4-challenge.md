Code challenges throughout these modules will reinforce what you've learned and help you gain some confidence before you continue on.

### Step 1: Add a new file

For this challenge, create a new code file. For example, you might create a file named `challenge.py`.

### Step 2: Write code in the new file to solve the challenge

Write a short program that prints one of several messages to the user based on their input.

First, prompt the user about whether they want to continue.

If the user responds with either `no` or `n`, print the phrase `Exiting`.

Match the following output in this `no` scenario. The user entered `no` when prompted.

```output
Would you like to continue? no
Exiting
```

If the user responds with either `yes` or `y`, print the phrases `Continuing ...` and `Complete!`.

Match the following output in this `yes` scenario. The user entered `yes` when prompted.

```output
Would you like to continue? yes
Continuing ...
Complete!
```

If the user responds with anything else, print the phrase `Please try again and respond with yes or no.`

Match the following output in this last scenario. The user entered `bob` when prompted.

```output
Would you like to continue? bob 
Please try again and respond with yes or no.
```
