In this module, you learned:

- What types of applications you can build by using Rust.
- Why Rust is useful for both low-level and high-level types of development.
- How to set up your development environment by using `rustup`.
- How to write and compile a simple rust program by using `rustc`.
- How to start a new project template, build it, and run it by using Cargo.

In the next module in this learning path, you'll walk through some common programming concepts, such as functions, data types, and control flow, in Rust.
