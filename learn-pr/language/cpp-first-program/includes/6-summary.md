In this module, you explored the concepts and basic syntax of the C++ language. You constructed a program in C++ by writing your first lines of C++ code.

You also learned a technique (`cout`) that displays literal string data to the console. You learned to identify programming errors in your code and their corresponding error messages.

Finally, you identified C++ syntax elements, like objects and functions, and the purpose of several special symbols called stream operators.

Congratulations on taking your first steps to building more sophisticated applications.
