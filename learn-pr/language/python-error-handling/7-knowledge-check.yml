  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "What are three elements that you might find in a traceback?"
    choices:
    - content: "A file path, line number, and Python version"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A Python version is never present in a traceback, although a file path and line number are."
    - content: "A Python version, file path, and function name"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A Python version is never present in a traceback, although file path and function name are."
    - content: "A file path, line number, and exception"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! Although you can find more elements aside from the path, line number, and exception, these three should be expected."
  - content: "What two keywords would you use for handling exceptions?"
    choices:
    - content: "`try` and `except`"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! These are the keywords that you would use to handle exceptions."
    - content: "`try` and `catch`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Even though `try` is how you start an exception-handling block, `catch` isn't a valid keyword."
    - content: "`try` and `unless`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Even though `try` is how you start an exception-handling block, `unless` isn't a valid keyword."
  - content: "Why would using `except Exception` be unhelpful?"
    choices:
    - content: "Because it can show a traceback with limited information"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect Using `except Exception` doesn't limit information in a traceback."
    - content: "Because it can hide what the real problem is"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! This technique usually hides what the underlying problem that caused the error is."
    - content: "Because you can't raise another exception"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. It's possible to raise another exception in this scenario."
  - content: "When can it be useful to use `as err` in an `except` block?"
    choices:
    - content: "When you want to raise another exception"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. It's possible to raise another exception without using `as err`."
    - content: "When you want to reuse or inspect an exception"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! When a raised exception will be reused or inspected, the `as err` statement can help."
    - content: "When you want to avoid having a traceback in the output"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Using `as error` is not a requirement to prevent having a traceback in the output."
  - content: "What is the right syntax to catch two exceptions in the same `except` line?"
    choices:
    - content: "`raise (ValueError, TypeError)`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This syntax wouldn't catch exceptions."
    - content: "`except ValueError, TypeError:`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This statement is not valid syntax in Python and would cause a syntax error."
    - content: "`except (ValueError, TypeError):`"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! Using parentheses and separating exceptions with a comma are the right way to catch two exceptions in the same line."
