In this module, you experienced how using debuggers can be an effective strategy to find and fix issues in your .NET programs. You learned about the tools and features in the Visual Studio debugger, and you used them to locate and fix a bug in a .NET program. You also learned how to do it even without knowing the code you're debugging beforehand.

In this module, you learned how to:

- Use the Visual Studio debugger with a .NET program.
- Create breakpoints and find issues by running your code step by step.
- Inspect your program state at any execution step.
- Analyze the call stack to find the source of an exception.
