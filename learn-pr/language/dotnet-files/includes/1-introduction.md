.NET has powerful built-in mechanisms for working with a file system. In this module, you explore the powerful features of the dotnet commands and processes.

Let's assume that you work for a company called *Tailwind Traders*, the second-largest online retailer in the world. Their IT operations department deals with mountains of data and files. The company has hired you to help it manage its data and files by using C# and .NET.

In this module, you write a program that searches through folders for sales files. When those files are found, you use C# and .NET to read and parse the sales-total data in those files. Finally, you summarize the sales totals into one grand total and write that value to a new file.
