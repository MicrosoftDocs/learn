.NET has powerful built-in mechanisms for working with the file system.

Assume for a moment that you work for a company called *Tailwind Traders*. Tailwind Traders is the second-largest online retailer in the world. It deals with mountains of data and files. The company has hired you to help it manage its data and files by using C# and .NET.

In this module, you'll write a program that searches through folders for sales files. When those files are found, you'll use C# and .NET to read and parse the sales-total data inside. Finally, you'll summarize those sales totals into one grand total and write that value to a new file.

## Learning objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Work with directories.
- Create and delete files.
- Read from files.
- Write to files.
- Parse data in files.

## Prerequisites

- Experience writing C# at the beginner level
- Familiarity with basic programming constructs, such as loops and `if` statements
