Our company needed to create a personalized marketing message to promote a new financial product to our customers.  Using C#, we were able to write code that combined string and numeric data about our current customers.

We exercised different techniques for merging a string template with variables using composite formatting and string interpolation.  The various specifiers allow us to properly format large numbers, currency, and percentages.  The built-in methods on variables of type string allowed us to add padding to left and right align data.

Imagine how much extra work would have required if we didn't have a wealth of string and number formatting tools and techniques available to us in C#.  We would likely attempt to use string concatenation everywhere, possibly making it difficult to maintain or update.

Techniques and tools for formatting strings and numeric data has a wide array of applications.  For example, we can use these techniques to present data for display on screen as well as format data to transfer between disparate systems.  It's a critical skill to master.  This module discussed some of the most popular and useful, but there are more.
