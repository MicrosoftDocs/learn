We'll start by talking about programming in general. What is a programming language? How does a programming language help you communicate commands to a computer?

## Hardware vs. software

Most of us understand that there are two aspects to our computers, devices, phones, and tablets: hardware and software.

_Hardware_ describes the physical components that accept input, process that input, and emit output. Hardware might include:

- A central processing unit (CPU).
- Random access memory (RAM) for short-term storage.
- A hard drive for long-term storage.
- A screen.
- A microphone.
- Connector ports like headphone jacks and USB ports.

_Software_ describes the electronic instructions that tell the hardware what to do. Types of software include:

- Operating systems that provide a foundation for device interaction.
- Games.
- Word processors.
- Spreadsheets.
- Web browsers.

People often refer to software as _programs_.

## What is a program?

A program is a set of instructions that do computing tasks. These instructions are compiled into a format that a computer understands. The compiled instructions are initiated or _run_ by a user. The term _user_ can mean either a human or another program.

The computer's CPU runs each instruction in the program line by line. The CPU:

- Saves and retrieves information, which is in temporary or permanent storage.
- Calculates and manipulates data.
- Displays information on a screen.
- Communicates with other programs via a network connection.

Even the most basic program will do one or more of the following tasks:

- **Input** - Input includes information:
  - Accepted from a user typing on a keyboard or clicking on a user interface.
  - Stored as data in a file.
  - Communicated from a network connection.
- **Processing** - Processing includes:
  - Performing logic.
  - Calculating mathematical formulas.
  - Other manipulation or calculation of input to produce new data.
- **Output** - Output includes information:
  - Displayed on a screen to a user.
  - Saved to a file.
  - Sent to another program via a network connection.

A program can be:

- A fully self-enclosed app like a game, a text editor, or billing software.
- A script like a sophisticated macro that executes inside another program to automate some functionality.
- A combination of live code, equations, and data visualizations used in Jupyter notebooks.

Python is frequently used for all of these purposes.

Some programs, including many you'll build as we get started, require at most a dozen lines of code. But sophisticated programs, like operating systems, require tens of thousands or even a million lines of code.

Some programs are small enough that a single software developer can build them. Others are so large and complex that dozens or even hundreds of developers build and maintain them. In that case, each developer works on some small part of the whole.

### What is programming?

_Programming_ is the act of writing instructions for a computer to create an app or script. Some people use different terms like _coding_ or _developing_ to describe programming.

A _programmer_ is someone who writes those instructions using a programming language like Python. Synonyms for programmer include _coder_, _software developer_, and _developer_.

### What is a programming language?

Programming languages, like Python, let you write instructions that you want a computer to carry out.

Each programming language has a different syntax. But after you learn your first programming language and then attempt to learn another one, you'll quickly realize they all share many similar ideas.

A programming language lets someone write instructions in a way that's readable and understandable by humans. The instructions you write in a programming language are called _source code_ or just _code_.

A software developer understands and modifies source code. But a computer can't understand or run source code. The source code must be compiled into a format that the computer understands. We'll talk about compilation, interpretation, and execution later in this module.

### What is syntax?

The _syntax_ of a programming language includes keywords, operators, and grammar rules. Operators are special characters like parentheses and the equal sign. A simple line of Python code might follow a dozen different syntax rules and use several different operators.

Many programming languages use English words and phrases as keywords. Python uses English words like **if**, **return**, **while**, and **import** as keywords. Fortunately, there are fewer than 40 keywords in Python, so you don't need to know English before you can start with Python.

To become fluent in any language, you need to learn and practice new vocabulary and concepts. Learning a programming language is no exception. For any language, there's much to learn. Fortunately, each concept is simple on its own. Don't give up! You can learn it!

### Why are there so many programming languages?

There are dozens of different programming languages. Programmers have discovered that available languages don't always offer needed flexibility, control, and ease of use. So they decide to craft their own.

Python was created to simplify software development by masking more complex interactions with the hardware. The tradeoff is that Python offers less control over those interactions. So Python might not be ideal for some processor-intensive apps.

Other programming languages provide greater control over complex interactions with the hardware. If used properly, they can yield performance better than Python's. But they can be more difficult to understand. Many software apps don't require this degree of optimization to improve performance.

### Should I learn Python first?

With so many options, you might wonder if you're making the right choice by starting your programming career with Python.

Python is a language friendly to beginners. Among other things, you'll learn how to:

- Employ basic logic.
- Create program structure.
- Build expressions and statements.
- Work with data.

Many of the syntax elements and other concepts are similar for all programming languages. Starting with a language friendly to beginners is a great first step. Later, you can add more programming languages. You'll then focus on just those parts of the new languages that differ from Python.

Furthermore, there's a strong demand for Python skills in a wide range of industries.

Plenty of learning resources are available for Python. Resources include this Learning Path, videos, articles, and books. Python is also well supported. If you run into a problem, there are many communities of experienced developers who are willing to help you solve the problem.

So yes, if you're looking to get started in programming, Python is a great choice.
