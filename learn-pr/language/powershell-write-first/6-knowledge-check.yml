  - content: "How does PowerShell compile?"
    choices:
    - content: "You run your code through a compiler as a step to outputting an executable program."

      explanation: "PowerShell isn't an interpreted language and doesn't get communicated to the computer as it runs."
    - content: "PowerShell doesn't compile at all, and the computer knows what your code says automatically."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "PowerShell code is compiled to something the computer can understand."

      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct!"
    - content: "If you make a mistake when you write code, you have to delete it all and start over."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "One of the great things about software development is, if you make a mistake, you can fix it and no one has to know."
  - content: 'What is **wrong** with this line of code? `Read-host "What is wrong with this line of code?"`'
    choices:
    - content: "The letter 'h' in `Read-host` should be uppercase."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The 'h' could be uppercase, but it doesn't have to be."
    - content: "It's missing a semicolon at the end."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "PowerShell doesn't need semicolons to tell when a command is over."
    - content: "The string should be enclosed in single quotation marks."
      isCorrect: false
