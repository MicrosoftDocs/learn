Code challenges throughout these modules reinforce what you've learned and help you gain
confidence before moving on.

### Step 1: Close any open files in Cloud Shell code editor

1. Use the keyboard shortcut <kbd>Ctrl+Q</kbd> (<kbd>⌘+Q</kbd> on macOS) to close any open
files in Cloud Shell code editor.

### Step 2: Create a new file to write your code

Create a new file named `GettingStarted.ps1` and use Cloud Shell code editor to open it.

### Step 3: Write code in Cloud Shell code editor to display two messages

Use the techniques you learned to print a message and take user input to reuse in a second message.
In other words, you learned how to display a message in just one line of code. You also learned how
to request input from a user, then reuse that value to print a custom message. Use both techniques
for this challenge.

No matter how you do it, your code should produce the following output. The `<text>` indicates a
custom value you need to replace.

```output
Todays date is <current date>.
Today is the day <your name> began their PowerShell programming journey.
```

### Step 4: Run the code

Close the code editor and run the script in Cloud Shell.
