PowerShell is a powerful, cross-platform task automation and configuration management framework. It
consists of a command-line shell and programming language. Among its uses, some of the common ones
are:

- Task automation and orchestration
- Configuration management
- Server and cloud management
- Custom tool making
- Scripting

PowerShell is a great language to learn whether you have prior programming experience or not. It's
beginner friendly due to it's readability, focus on simplicity, and built-in help systems.

The best way to learn how to code in any language is to _write_ as much code as possible. So, we
encourage you to type along with the exercises in this module and others in this learning path.
Typing the code yourself in each exercise and solving the coding challenges accelerate your
learning and teach you small foundational concepts to build on with practice and exploration.

## Learning objectives

- Manage PowerShell inputs and outputs
- Diagnose errors when you type code incorrectly
- Identify different PowerShell elements like cmdlets, parameters, inputs, and outputs.

These units give you your first look at the PowerShell syntax. They provide invaluable insights
and introduce many new ideas, which will be expanded on in other modules.
