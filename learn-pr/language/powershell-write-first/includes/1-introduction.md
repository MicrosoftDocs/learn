PowerShell is a powerful, cross-platform task automation and configuration management framework. It consists of a command-line shell and programming language. Here are its most common uses:

- Task automation and orchestration
- Configuration management
- Server and cloud management
- Custom tool making
- Scripting

PowerShell is a great language to learn whether you have prior programming experience or not. It's a beginner-friendly language because of its readability, focus on simplicity, and built-in help system.

The best way to learn how to code in any language is to _write_ as much code as possible. We encourage you to type along with the exercises in this module and others in this learning path. Typing the code yourself in each exercise and solving the coding challenges can accelerate your learning and teach you small foundational concepts to build on with practice and exploration.

## Learning objectives

After you've completed this module, you'll be able to:

- Manage PowerShell inputs and outputs.
- Diagnose errors when you type code incorrectly.
- Identify PowerShell elements such as cmdlets, parameters, inputs, and outputs.

This module gives you your first look at the PowerShell syntax. It provides invaluable insights and introduces many new ideas that will be expanded on in other modules.
