Our goal was to write code that takes input from a user and output to the console and
become familiar with the syntax of PowerShell. We learned what programming languages are and they
communicate to the computer. We wrote our first programs using basic PowerShell syntax. Also, we learned
how to display string data to the console and receive string input from the user. We learned what to
look for when we get errors from our code and identified PowerShell syntax elements like cmdlets,
parameters, and variables.

Congratulations on taking your first steps to building more sophisticated programs.
