  questions: 
    - content: "Why is a container orchestrator useful in a microservice architecture?"
      choices:
        - content: "Each microservice needs to be maintained, scaled, and deployed individually. An orchestrator helps manage those tasks."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "The orchestrator can dynamically respond to changes in the environment to increase or decrease the deployed instances of the managed app. Or, it can ensure all deployed container instances get updated if a new version of a service is released."
        - content: "An orchestrator holds instructions on how to build and version Docker image."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "An orchestrator is a system that automatically deploys and manages containerized apps."
        - content: "An orchestrator is the only means by which to run a containerized application in the cloud."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "While orchestrators work in the cloud, by no means are they the only way to run containerized applications in the cloud."
