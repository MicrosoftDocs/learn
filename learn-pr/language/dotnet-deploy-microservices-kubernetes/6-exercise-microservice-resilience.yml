quiz:  
  title: Check your knowledge
  questions: 
    - content: "Why does Kubernetes automatically restart pods that have failed?"
      choices:
        - content: "Kubernetes will maintain the system state as defined in the configuration files no matter what."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "One of the benefits of Kubernetes is the support for declarative configuration management. What you define in the configuration files will be retained at all costs."
        - content: "Kubernetes will maintain the current system state as is when a failure occurs."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Kubernetes will recover to a state defined in the configuration files, not to a state as it was running."
        - content: "Kubernetes will not automatically recover, rather it needs to be told to."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "A benefit of Kubernetes is that it automatically maintains system state as defined, it will recover automatically."
