quiz:  
  title: Check your knowledge
  questions: 
    - content: "What is the reason Kubernetes restarts pods when they fail?"
      choices:
        - content: "Kubernetes ensures the system state matches what is defined in the configuration files, regardless of the circumstances."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "One benefit of Kubernetes is its support for declarative configuration management. Whatever you define in the configuration files is maintained consistently."
        - content: "Kubernetes maintains the current system state as is when a failure occurs."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Kubernetes recovers to a state defined in the configuration files, not to a state as it was running."
        - content: "Kubernetes doesn't automatically recover, rather it needs to be told to."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "A benefit of Kubernetes is that it automatically maintains system state as defined, it recovers automatically."
