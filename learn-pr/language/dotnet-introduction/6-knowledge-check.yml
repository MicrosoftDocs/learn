  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "Imagine that you used C# code to create a new application. After running the code, you discover a bug in your logic. How can you find the bug?"
    choices:
    - content: "The C# compiler helps you find the logic bug."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The compiler identifies C# syntax compilation errors. But it doesn't catch bugs in your logic."
    - content: "The .NET runtime helps you find the logic bug."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "If your logic produces an exception that crashes your program, then the .NET runtime closes your application. But it doesn't help you find your logic bug."
    - content: "A class in the .NET library helps you find your logic bug."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "No classes in the .NET library help you find a logic bug."
    - content: "The debugging features of Visual Studio or the .NET CLI can help you find your logic bug."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. You can use debugging tools to set breakpoints, step through code, and monitor the value of variables to help you find bugs."
  - content: "Which one of the following terms describes an application framework that combines several related libraries. Along with starter projects, file templates, code generators, and other tools that developers use to build an application for a specific purpose?"
    choices:
    - content: "A workload"

      explanation: "In a software-development context, *environment* usually refers to the collection of tools that are used to build applications."
  - content: "Which one of the following terms best describes the installer that you need to create projects, write code, call methods in libraries, and compile code. Then build, debug, and run applications?"
    choices:
    - content: "The .NET runtime"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The .NET runtime can run only .NET assemblies. We're looking for an answer that covers broader functionality."
    - content: "The .NET base libraries"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The .NET base libraries contain functionality that you can access from your code. But we're looking for an answer that covers broader functionality."
    - content: "The .NET SDK"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct!"
    - content: "A .NET assembly"
