  questions:
  - content: "Imagine that you used C# code to create a new application. After running the code, you discover a bug in your logic.  How can you find the bug?"
    choices:
    - content: "The C# compiler will help you find the logic bug."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The compiler will identify C# syntax compilation errors. But it will not catch bugs in your logic."
    - content: "The .NET runtime will help you find the logic bug."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "If your logic produces an exception that crashes your program, then the .NET runtime will close your application. But it will not help you find your logic bug."
    - content: "A class in the .NET library will help you find your logic bug."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "No classes in the .NET library will help you find a logic bug."
    - content: "The debugging features of Visual Studio or the .NET CLI can help you find your logic bug."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. You can use debugging tools to set breakpoints, step through code, and monitor the value of variables to help you find bugs."
  - content: "Which one of the following terms describes an application framework that combines several related libraries, along with starter projects, file templates, code generators, and other tools that developers use to build an application for a specific purpose?"
    choices:
    - content: "A workload"

    - content: "The .NET base libraries"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The .NET base libraries contain a lot of functionality that you can access from your code.  But we're looking for an answer that covers broader functionality."
    - content: "The .NET SDK"
