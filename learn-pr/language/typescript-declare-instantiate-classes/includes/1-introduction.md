As a JavaScript programmer, you may have experience with classes, or the pre-[ECMAScript 2015](https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/?azure-portal=true) (ES6) implementation based on constructors and prototypes. JavaScript classes in ES6 are primarily syntactical sugar over JavaScript’s existing prototype-based inheritance.

Classes in TypeScript extend the ES6 functionality by adding TypeScript-specific features like type annotations for class members, access modifiers, and the ability to specify required or optional parameters. Another benefit of using TypeScript is that you can use it to develop with classes and then compile them down to JavaScript that works across all major browsers and platforms, as needed.

## Learning objectives

After completing this module, you'll be able to:

- Explain how you can use TypeScript classes describe the shape of objects. 
- Declare a class using TypeScript.
- Instantiate a class using TypeScript.
- Apply access modifiers to a class.
- Define static properties in a class.
- Declare a class that extends another class.
- Declare an interface to ensure class shape.
- Determine when to use an interface or a class to define the structure of an object.

## Prerequisites

- Knowledge of TypeScript
- Familiarity with JavaScript
- Familiarity with TypeScript functions and interfaces.
- Installed software:
  - [Git](https://git-scm.com/?azure-portal=true)
  - [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com?azure-portal=true)
  - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/?azure-portal=true)
  - TypeScript - TypeScript can be installed after installing Node.js after running the following in a terminal or command window:

      ```bash
      npm install -g typescript
      ```

For best results, follow the complete instructions for setting up your environment and using the TypeScript compiler in [Module 01: Get started with TypeScript](/learn/modules/typescript-get-started/). After setting up your environment, you can run any of the Lab setup or solution files in the [Build JavaScript applications by using TypeScript](/learn/paths/build-javascript-applications-typescript/) learning path.
