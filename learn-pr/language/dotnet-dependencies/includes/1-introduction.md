When you work on an application, you write code to implement business requirements. For the sake of speed and reliability, you and your team won't write all the code yourselves. You'll rely on external code: libraries that someone else wrote.

One way to approach building your app with external libraries is to use existing libraries from which you can download and to which you can possibly even add. By using these libraries, you'll be able to finish building your app sooner and take it to market faster than the competition. Another benefit to using libraries might be to ensure that your app follows recommended practices for authentication and authorization. After all, protecting your data and your customers' data is a significant concern.

In this module, you'll use the .NET command-line tool and the NuGet package registry to add libraries to your application code. You'll also learn about managing updates and mitigating issues.
