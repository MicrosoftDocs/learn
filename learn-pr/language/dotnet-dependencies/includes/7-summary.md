You started by learning how to install dependencies that your app can use. Using dependencies in your application helps you create the application faster, because the code is already written. Also, it's a good idea to rely on tried and tested libraries rather than writing something yourself. Using these libraries is an especially good idea when you're adding authentication and authorization to your app.

This module then showed you how to use the .NET CLI to install dependencies locally.

After that, you learned how to update your dependencies. Dependencies are updated for various reasons in the form of bug fixes, new features, or larger changes. In the project file, you can configure the types of updates in which you're interested on a per-dependency basis. If you work in an enterprise environment, we recommend that you carefully consider your approach regarding the types of updates you're OK with.
