  - The difference between concurrency and parallelism.
  - How communication works in a concurrent program by using channels.
  - How to write a program that runs faster by implementing concurrency.
  - How to write dynamic programs that can use buffers to take advantage of concurrency when you want to launch a limited number of concurrent calls.
prerequisites: |
  - A Go environment that's ready to create applications. Ideally, you should have installed and configured Go locally and installed [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) with the [Go extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=golang.Go).
