  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "What's the correct syntax to create a goroutine?"
    choices:
    - content: "`func (){}()`."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect: you need to use the `go` keyword before the method you want to execute as a goroutine."
    - content: "`go launch()`."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct: you need to use the `go` keyword before the method you want to execute as a goroutine."
    - content: "goroutine launch()`."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect: you need to use the `go` keyword before the method you want to execute as a goroutine."
    - content: "`thread launch()`."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect: you need to use the `go` keyword before the method you want to execute as a goroutine."
  - content: "What's the purpose of using channels in Go?"
    choices:
    - content: "To communicate properly within goroutines and avoid sharing memory for communication purposes."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "This is why Go says that we don't have to communicate by sharing memory; instead, we should share memory by communicating."
    - content: "It's just another way of creating goroutines."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect: You create a goroutine by using the `go` keyword."
    - content: "To send data when doing HTTP calls to another API."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect: Channels are used for communication purposes among goroutines."
    - content: "To communicate between classes."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Channels help communicate properly within goroutines."
  - content: "What's a particular feature of unbuffered channels?"
    choices:
    - content: "Channels that are dynamic, they can grow as you need automatically."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The main feature from unbuffered channels is that they communicate synchronously, for every data you send, you need to have a way to receive the message; otherwise, the program will get blocked."
    - content: "Sending and receiving data in channels are blocking operations."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Unbuffered channels communicate synchronously, for every data you send, you need to have a way to receive the message; otherwise, the program will get blocked."
    - content: "Channels that you can pass by reference only."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The main feature from unbuffered channels is that they communicate synchronously, for every data you send, you need to have a way to receive the message; otherwise, the program will get blocked."  
  - content: "How do you send data to a channel?"
    choices:
    - content: "`ch = \"Hi\"`."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. You need to place the `<-` operator after the channel variable to assign a value."
    - content: "`ch <- \"Hi\"`."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. You need to place the `<-` operator after the channel variable to assign a value."
    - content: "`send(ch, \"Hi\")`."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. You need to place the `<-` operator after the channel variable to assign a value."
  - content: "How do you receive data from a channel?"
    choices:
    - content: "`res := <- ch`."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct: you need to place the `<-` operator before the channel variable to read its value."
    - content: "`res := get(ch)`."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect: you need to place the `<-` operator before the channel variable to read its value."
    - content: "`res := ch<-`."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. you need to place the `<-` operator before the channel variable to read its value."
