In recent years, enterprises are choosing to use microservices instead of monolithic architectures to meet user demand and increase scalability and availability in their large consumer applications.

Suppose that you started a new job as a software developer at the Contoso outdoor equipment company. Business is booming, and so is Contoso's website that indicates whether items are in stock. That website is a monolith right now, but it's an ideal candidate for the microservices architecture. A team member refactored the monolith website into an ASP.NET Blazor page application and a .NET web API. Your job is to deploy the services.

In this module, you gain an understanding of the microservices architectural pattern and the problems that it solves. You see how you can use Docker to implement the microservices architectural pattern with an ASP.NET web API.

By the end of this module, you'll have the foundation to build microservices with .NET and understand how you can use Docker to implement the microservices architectural pattern.

If you need to learn more about Docker, review the training module [Introduction to Docker containers](/training/modules/intro-to-docker-containers/).
