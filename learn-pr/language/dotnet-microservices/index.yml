  title: Build your first microservice with .NET
  description: Microservice applications are composed of small, independently versioned, and scalable customer-focused services that communicate with each other by using standard protocols and well-defined interfaces. Each microservice typically encapsulates simple business logic, which you can scale out or in. You test, deploy, and manage the microservice independently. Smaller teams develop a microservice based on a customer scenario and choose the technologies that they use. This module teaches you how to build your first microservice by using .NET.
