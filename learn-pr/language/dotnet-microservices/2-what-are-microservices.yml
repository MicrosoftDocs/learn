quiz:
  questions:
  - content: "Which of the following scenarios would be a candidate to become a microservice?"
    choices:
    - content: "A web API that returns a list of pizzas."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "A microservice is a service that performs a single business purpose. In this case, returning only a list of pizzas."
    - content: "A web API and a website that return and display a list of pizzas."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "A microservice performs only a single business purpose. Here, two business purposes are being performed."
    - content: "A website that's deployed by using GitHub Actions."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "A microservice is a service that is part of a larger application that serves a business need. Although GitHub Actions helps with deployment, it doesn't fit as a microservice."
    - content: "A Docker image."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "A Docker image is a static representation of a microservice, not the microservice itself."
  - content: "What purpose does a Docker image have in a microservices architecture pattern?"
    choices:
    - content: "It's a text file with instructions for how to build the microservice."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The Dockerfile is the text file with instructions on how to build the microservice."
    - content: "A Docker image is a static representation of a microservice, its configuration, and its dependencies."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "A developer creates an app or service, and then packages it and its dependencies in a container image."
    - content: "Docker images allow hosts to perform load-balancing and routing."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Orchestrators allow hosts to perform load-balancing and routing."
  - content: "What's the difference between a container and an image?"
    choices:
    - content: "To create the initialization routine for the Docker engine."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "A Dockerfle doesn't describe how to initialize the Docker engine."
    - content: "To create a text file with instructions for how to build a Docker image."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "A Dockerfile is used to create the Docker image."
    - content: "To create the code to run the microservice."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The code to create the microservice is created in the tool that is best suited for the job. Any language and framework will work."
