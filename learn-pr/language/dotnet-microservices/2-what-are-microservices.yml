    - content: "A website that's deployed by using GitHub Actions."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "A microservice is a service that is part of a larger application that serves a business need. Although GitHub Actions helps with deployment, it doesn't fit as a microservice."
    - content: "A Docker image."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "A Docker image is a static representation of a microservice, not the microservice itself."
  - content: "What purpose does a Docker image have in a microservices architecture pattern?"
    choices:
    - content: "It's a text file with instructions for how to build the microservice."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The Dockerfile is the text file with instructions on how to build the microservice."
    - content: "A Docker image is a static representation of a microservice, its configuration, and its dependencies."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "A developer creates an app or service, and then packages it and its dependencies in a container image."
    - content: "Docker images allow hosts to perform load-balancing and routing."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Orchestrators allow hosts to perform load-balancing and routing."
  - content: "What's the difference between a container and an image?"
    choices:
    - content: "The container hosts multiple images as they're created."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "A container doesn't host images."
    - content: "The container is a template that describes what images are."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "A container isn't a template."
    - content: "The container can be thought of as running an instance of an image."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Multiple containers can be created from the same image. Each container has its own unique state and data."
