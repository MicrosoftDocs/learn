  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "Arrays are a fixed-length data type, but how can you define their size based on the data you used to initialize them?"
    choices:
    - content: "You have to determine the number of elements when declaring the array."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect, you can use ellipsis `...` to determine its size based on the data you use to initialize the array."
    - content: "You can use an ellipsis (`...`), like this `q := [...]int{1, 2, 3}`."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. When you use an ellipsis, the data you use to initialize an array defines the array size."
    - content: "You have to create a slice too define their size."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Slices are dynamic, but this question was specific to arrays, and you can use ellipsis `...` to define its size based on the data you use to initialize it."
  - content: "A slice works with an underlying array, and arrays are fixed-sized length. What happens when you add an element to the slice and the underlying array is full?"
    choices:
    - content: "You get a panic error."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Go will create a new array and double its size to hold more elements when needed."
    - content: "You don't get an error, but the new element is not added to the slice."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Go will create a new array and double its size to hold the new element and have space for more elements."
    - content: "Go doubles the size of the underlying array."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Go will create a new array and double its size to hold more elements when needed."
  - content: "What happens when you create another slice using the slice operator `s[i:j]` and you make a change to an element in the new slice?"
    choices:
    - content: "Only the slice you created gets affected as when you make a sub slice points to a new memory address."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A slice is merely pointing to an underlying array, so you need to create a copy of the slice if you don't want to affect others."
    - content: "You can't create a sub slice, so you'd have to create a new one."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. You can create a sub slice using the slice operator `s[i:j]`."
    - content: "The original slice changes because a slice is simply a pointer to an underlying array."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. A slice is merely pointing to an underlying array, so you need to create a copy of the slice if you don't want to affect others."
  - content: "When you're iterating the elements from a map, can you access the key and its value simultaneously?"
    choices:
    - content: "You could use the syntax `for key, value := range map`. to access the key and value"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. when you loop the elements from a map, you can access the key and its value."
    - content: "No, you can only access the map's values."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. When you loop the elements from a map, you can access the key and its value."
    - content: "You can only access both the key and the value when they are the same type."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The key and the value can have a different type, and when you loop the elements from a map, you can access the key and its value."
  - content: "Can you embed one struct into another struct?"
    choices:
    - content: "No, because Go doesn't have support for inheritance."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Go doesn't support inheritance, but you can embed one struct into another."
    - content: "Yes, and you can even access the parent properties as if it was part of the child struct."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. When you create a field with the same name as the name of the parent struct, you're embedding a struct into another struct."
    - content: "No, you have to use two structs and repeat code as needed."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. When you create a field with the same name as the name of the parent struct, you're embedding a struct into another struct."
