TypeScript provides two ways to organize code: Namespaces and modules. This module explains how to organize TypeScript code using namespaces. While both namespaces and modules provide a way to categorize related code in meaningful ways and help you control which code is exposed to the global namespace of your applications, there are some differences between them.

## Learning objectives

- Explain the purpose of namespaces.
- Implement single-file namespaces.
- Implement multi-file namespaces.
- Explain the design considerations for using namespaces and modules.

## Prerequisites

- Knowledge of TypeScript
- Familiarity with JavaScript
- Installed software:
  - [Git](https://git-scm.com/?azure-portal=true)
  - [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com?azure-portal=true)
  - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/?azure-portal=true)
  - TypeScript - TypeScript can be installed after installing Node.js after running the following in a terminal or command window:

      ```bash
      npm install -g typescript
      ```

For best results, follow the complete instructions for setting up your environment and using the TypeScript compiler in [Module 01: Get started with TypeScript](/learn/modules/typescript-get-started/). After setting up your environment, you can run any of the Lab setup or solution files in the  [Build JavaScript applications by using TypeScript](/learn/paths/build-javascript-applications-typescript/) learning path.
