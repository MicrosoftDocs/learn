  questions:
  - content: "Why is it useful to use plain `assert` statements with Pytest tests?"
    choices:
    - content: "It makes tests perform faster."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Tests donâ€™t perform faster when using plain assert statements."
    - content: "It allows you to use Python operators for any comparison."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. By using the plain assert statement, you can take advantage of using Python operators for all comparisons."
    - content: "It allows tests to be executed in parallel."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Using plain assert statements aren't required for parallel testing."
  - content: "What is one reason to group tests in a test class?"
    choices:
    - content: "So that tests can benefit from a common setup or cleanup."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. When tests need a common setup or cleanup, it makes sense to group them in a class"
    - content: "So that tests can take advantage of using plain assert statements."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Plain assert statements can be used in any test function or method with Pytest."
    - content: "So that tests can get randomized for better coverage."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Grouping tests in a class isn't closely related to randomizing tests or coverage"
  - content: "Can Pytest be used as a Python library for testing?"
    choices:
    - content: "No, Pytest doesn't have other modules and helpers to be used as a library."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Pytest does offer several helpers for testing."
    - content: "No, Pytest only allows extensibility through plugins."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Although Pytest allows extensions via plugins, it can also be used as a library."
    - content: "Yes, Pytest has modules and helpers that you can import in your tests."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Pytest does offer several helpers and modules for easier testing."
