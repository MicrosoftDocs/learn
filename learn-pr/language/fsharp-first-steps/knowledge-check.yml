  questions:
  - content: "What is F#?"
    choices:
    - content: "A programming language for the Java Virtual Machine (JVM)"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "While F# is a programming language, it is not a programming language for the Java Virtual Machine (JVM)"
    - content: "A musical note"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "While it is true that F# is a musical note, it's not a musical note in this context."
    - content: "F# is an open-source, cross-platform programming language that makes it easy to write succinct, performant, robust, and practical code"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "F#"
  - content: "What is a feature in F# that can help you write less code?"
    choices:
    - content: "Type inference"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "With type inference, you don't have to explicitly define your data types resulting in less code"
    - content: "Asynchronous programming"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "F#'s built-in support for asynchronous programming simplifies asynchronous workflows, but it doesn't directly translate to less code."
    - content: "F# Interactive"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "F# Interactive help you start writing code faster, but it doesn't affect the amount of code you write."
  - content: "What is a feature in F# that can help you write performant code?"
    choices:
    - content: "Debugger"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "While the debugger can help you write bug-free code, it doesn't directly have an impact on performance."
    - content: "Built-in parallelism & concurrency"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "F# simplifies writing performant code by having features like `async` expressions built into the language"
    - content: "Strong functional & object programming support"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Having the choice to use whichever patterns are best for the job doesn't directly translate into performant code."
  - content: "What is a feature in F# that can help you write robust code?"
    choices:
    - content: "Lightweight syntax"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "F#'s lightweight syntax can help you write less code, but that does not mean it is robust."
    - content: "Sequences"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Sequences are a language feature, but not one that directly impacts how robust your code is."
    - content: "Immutable by default"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Values that can't change during the execute your code are simpler to test and reason about help build robust code."
  - content: "What is F# Interactive?"
    choices:
    - content: "A notebook computing environment for F#"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: ".NET has a notebook computing environment (.NET Interactive) where you can run F#, C#, and other languages, it's not the same as F# Interactive."
    - content: "A programming environment to run F# code interactively at the console, or to execute F# scripts"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! In F# Interactive, you can use the REPL directly or write your code in script with the .fsx file extension."
    - content: "A video game"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Although building applications with F# interactive can be a lot of fun, it's not a video game."
