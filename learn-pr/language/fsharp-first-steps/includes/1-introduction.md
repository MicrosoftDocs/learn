F# is an open-source, cross-platform programming language that makes it easy to write succinct, performant, robust, and practical code

With F#, you can build applications like:

- Web APIs
- Single-Page applications (SPA)
- WebAssembly
- Desktop
- Mobile
- Big data
- Data science & machine learning
- Internet-of-Things (IoT)
- Gaming

## What are we doing?

In this module, you'll:

- Understand what makes F# a good language for building applications
- Write your first line of F# code.
- Build your first F# console application.

## What is the main goal?

By the end of this module, you'll be able to write F# code to print a message to a text console, like the Windows command prompt or Linux bash shell. These lines of code provide you with your first look at the F# syntax, and immediately provide invaluable insights into what makes F# a great programming language.
