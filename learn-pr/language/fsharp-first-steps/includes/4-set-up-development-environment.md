In this exercise, set up your F# development environment by installing the .NET SDK, Visual Studio Code, and the F# Ionide extension.

## Install .NET SDK

To get started writing code with F#, install the .NET SDK.

        ```dotnetcli
        dotnet --version
        ```

    1. The following output is similar to what displays in the console. Your version might be different, but as long as the version information is output to the console, it means everything is installed correctly.

        ```console
        9.0.201
        ```

## Install Visual Studio Code & Ionide F# extension

Once you have the .NET SDK installed, install Visual Studio Code and the Ionide extension.
