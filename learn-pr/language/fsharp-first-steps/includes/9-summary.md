You built your first F# console application. In doing so, you were able to become familiar with F# syntax and experience why F# is a great choice for building applications.

After setting up your development environment, you:

- Wrote your first line of F# code using the F# Interactive programming environment.
- Built your first F# application to print a message to a text console using the built-in .NET CLI templates.

You now understand the fundamentals of how to get started building F# applications.
