  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "Are strings immutable?"
    choices:
    - content: "No, because they can be modified."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Strings are immutable. However, you can create new strings that are modified."
    - content: "Yes, because you can't modify them."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! Strings are immutable, because you can't modify them."
    - content: "No, because you can split them."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Although you can split a string, you're not modifying the original (immutable) string."
  - content: "What types of quotation marks can be used with strings?"
    choices:
    - content: "Single, double, and triple quotation marks."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! All three options can be used with strings."
    - content: "Single and double quotation marks."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Although you can use single and double quotes, you can also use triple quotation marks to surround a string."
    - content: "Only double quotation marks."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Besides double quotes, you can also use single and triple quotes with strings."
  - content: "What is the string method call to use to break strings into separate lines?"
    choices:
    - content: "The `.separate('\n')` method."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The `.separate()` method doesn't exist as part of the string object."
    - content: "The `.newlines()` method."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The `.newlines()` method doesn't exist as part of the string object."
    - content: "The `.split('\n')` method."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! The `.split('\n')` method, which includes the newline character, breaks strings into separate lines."
  - content: "What two string methods can you use to check to see whether a word exists in a string?"
    choices:
    - content: "The `.find()` and `.count()` methods."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! You can use those two methods to verify the existence of a word in a string."
    - content: "The `.search()` and `.count()`methods."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Although `.count()` is a valid method for searching, `.search()` isn't part of the string object."
    - content: "The `.check()` and `.search()` methods."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Neither `.check()` nor `.search()` exists as a method of the string object."
  - content: "What is a problem you might run into when you use `%` for formatting?"
    choices:
    - content: "When many replacements are needed, it can make a program slower."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Although `%` formatting isn't the fastest, slowness isn't a result of the replacements."
    - content: "The code can be harder to read when many replacements are needed."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! Using `%` can become verbose with many replacements."
    - content: "It isn't possible to replace more than nine variables."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. It's possible to replace more than nine variables by using the `%` formatting method."
  - content: "How can you round down a number when you use f-strings?"
    choices:
    - content: "Use the `.format()` method to round down."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. You can't use `.format()` in f-strings because it isn't part of an f-string object."
    - content: "Use the `round()` function inside the string, enclosed in braces (`{}`)."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! Code execution is allowed within an f-string."
    - content: "You can't round a number when you use f-strings. You must round it before you use it in a string."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Although you can round a number before you use it in a string, there's a way to do so within the f-string."
