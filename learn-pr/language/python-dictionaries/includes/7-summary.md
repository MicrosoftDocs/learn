Most programs require data more complex than string and number values. In the scenario for this module, you've been attempting to work with information about the planets in the solar system. This information included properties such as the number of moons, and the circumference of the planets.

By using dictionaries, you were able to create a variable to store all related data. You then used `keys` and `values` to interact with the data directly, without using key names to perform calculations.

Python dictionaries are flexible objects, allowing you to model complex and related data. In this module, you learned how to:

- Identify when to use a dictionary.
- Create and modify data inside a dictionary.
- Use dictionary methods to access dictionary data.
