  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
    - content: How do you return from a function?
      choices: 
        - content: The last row of the function is the return value.
          explanation: Correct.
          isCorrect: true
        - content: You use the `return` keyword.
          explanation: There's no `return` keyword. What's on the last line is what's being returned.
          isCorrect: false
        - content: You declare a variable called `return` and place it last.
          explanation: Incorrect. All you need to do is place something on the last line of the function and it will be returned.
          isCorrect: false
    - content: How would you declare the `add()` function that takes two strings and returns an int?
      choices:
        - content: Write it like `let add a b = a + b`.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. This function takes two integers and returns an int. You need to specify the parameter types explicitly in this case.
        - content: Write it like `let add (a:string) (b:string):int = (int a) + (int b)`.
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: Correct. Adding the type to the parameters is needed, and the return type can either be explicitly pointed as :int or inferred by the compiler.
        - content: Write it like `let add (a:string) (b:string):bool = (int a) + (int b)`.
          explanation: Incorrect. The return type is bool, it needs to be int, which it can be by either specifying the return as :int or let the compiler infer it.
          isCorrect: false
    - content: The following code `let addAndMultiply = add >> multiply` is doing what?
      choices: 
        - content: Creating a pipeline.
          explanation: Incorrect. The code is using the composition operator `>>` to compose several functions into one. A pipeline uses the `|>` operator.
          isCorrect: false
        - content: Defining a function.
          explanation: Incorrect. Technically, the `addAndMultiply()` function is being declared, but a composition creates one function out of several other functions.
          isCorrect: false
        - content: Creating a composition.
          explanation: Correct. It's using the composition operator `>>` to create a more complex function.
          isCorrect: true
