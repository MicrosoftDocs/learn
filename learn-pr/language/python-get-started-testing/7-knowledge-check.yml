quiz:
  questions:
  - content: "What is one common side-effect for functions when there are no tests involved?"
    choices:
    - content: "Functions will run faster because they don't need to use tests."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Functions don't depend on tests to run."
    - content: "Functions can grow in complexity and size."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! When a function isn't tested, it's common to see it grow and become more complex."
    - content: "Functions will run slower and have more arguments."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Although it's possible that a function may run slower and have more arguments, these characteristics aren't related to not having tests."
  - content: "What is a recognizable aspect in functions and methods when testing is involved?"
    choices:
    - content: "They tend to have a single responsibility instead of doing many different things"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! Code that is well tested tends to concentrate on a single responsibility."
    - content: "They're more flexible, allowing more arguments"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Flexibility and allowing more arguments aren't usually the effects of testing."
    - content: "They don't tend to raise exceptions"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Code can raise exceptions even when they're tested thoroughly."
  - content: "What is the correct Python invocation to use test auto discovery?"
    choices:
    - content: "`python -m autodiscovery`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. `autodiscovery` isn't a Python module, so this invocation wouldn't work."
    - content: "`python -m discovery`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. `discovery` isn't a Python module, so this invocation wouldn't work."
    - content: "`python -m unittest`"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! Using the Python executable along with the unittest module is the right way to use test auto discovery"
