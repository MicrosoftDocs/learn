  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "Which function should you use when you want to evaluate whether a value is of type string?"
    choices:
    - content: "The `isstring()` function"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "There is no `isstring()` function."
    - content: "The `type()` function"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The `type()` function returns only the type.  It doesn't evaluate the type to see whether it matches some type, such as `str`."
    - content: "The `isinstance()` function"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Choose `isinstance()` when you want to evaluate whether a value is of a certain type."
    - content: "The `isnumeric()` function"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The `isnumeric()` function doesn't allow you to evaluate whether a value is of type string."
  - content: "You want to determine whether one number divides evenly into another number.  Which operator would you use?"
    choices:
    - content: "The `/` operator"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Simple division alone doesn't answer this question."
    - content: "The `^` operator"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The `^` symbol is not used in Python."
    - content: "The `&` operator"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The `&` symbol is used for bitwise operations and doesn't answer this question."
    - content: "The `%` operator"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "If the modulus is *0*, the divisor divides evenly into the dividend."
  - content: "Suppose you have a value *1.468* in a variable called `interest_rate` and you want to round it to `1.5`.  How would you call the `round()` method?"
    choices:
    - content: "`round(interest_rate)`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This is not correct."
    - content: "`round(interest_rate, 0)`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This is not correct."
    - content: "`round(interest_rate, 1)`"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct!"
    - content: "`round(interest_rate, 2)`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This is not correct."
