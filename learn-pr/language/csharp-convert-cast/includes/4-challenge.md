Code challenges throughout these modules will reinforce what you've learned and help you gain some confidence before continuing.

## First challenge

This module will feature two code challenges.  This first challenge forces you to split up the data depending on its type and either concatenate or add the data accordingly.

### Step 1: Delete all of the code in the .NET Editor from the earlier exercise.

Select all of the code in the .NET Editor then select the `del` or backspace key to delete it.

### Step 2: Write code in the .NET Editor to implement the business rules.

Iterate through each value in a string of values.

Start with the following line of code.

```csharp-interactive
string[] values = { "12.3", "45", "ABC", "11", "DEF" };
```

Add all the code necessary to implement the following business rules:

**Business Rules:**

Rule 1: If the value is alphanumeric, concatenate it to form a message

Rule 2: If the value is numeric, add it to the total

Rule 3: Make sure the result matches the following output:

```output
Message: ABCDEF
Total: 68.3
```
