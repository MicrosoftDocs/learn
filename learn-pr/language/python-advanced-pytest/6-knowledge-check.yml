  questions:
  - content: "What is one useful feature of adding fixtures to the _conftest.py_ file?"
    choices:
    - content: "That it allows importing those fixtures in a test suite."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Adding fixtures in a _conftest.py_ file doesn't affect their importing in a suite."
    - content: "That is allows sharing the fixtures without importing them in a test suite."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. By adding fixtures in a _conftest.py_, they become available to any test in a test suite without importing them."
    - content: "Because it allows fixtures to require Pytest fixtures."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Fixtures can always require Pytest fixtures regardless of their location."
  - content: "What makes a test be a good candidate for `parametrize()`?"
    choices:
    - content: "When a test needs to loop over inputs for the same assertion"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Parametrize is a great choice to avoid looping. Converting input items into individual tests."
    - content: "When a test needs to catch multiple exceptions."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Multiple exceptions in a test don't make it a good candidate for _parametrize_."
    - content: "When a test needs to run in parallel"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. There’s no need to use _parametrize_ to run tests in parallel"
  - content: "Why multiple arguments with _parametrize_ might not be a good idea?"
    choices:
    - content: "Because Pytest doesn't allow it. An exception gets raised instead."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Pytest does allow multiple arguments with _parametrize_."
    - content: "Because test functions don't allow multiple arguments."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Test functions do allow multiple arguments, including when testing with _parametrize_." 
    - content: "Because it can make tests harder to read."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. When using multiple arguments with _parametrize_, it can make tests harder to read."
