      explanation: "`flag` is a valid variable name."
    - content: "yes"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Admittedly, `yes` isn't a great variable name however it's valid."
  - content: "What is the problem with this line of code: `var message;`"
    choices:
    - content: "`var` isn't a data type."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "It's true that `var` isn't a data type, but that's not the problem with this code."
    - content: "Use of `var` keyword without initializing the variable"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct!"
    - content: "`message` isn't a good name for a variable."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "There's nothing wrong with the variable name by itself.  It might be appropriate depending on the usage."
    - content: "A variable named `message` should always be a string."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This isn't necessarily true.  It depends on the context."
  - content: "Which of the following lines of code creates a variable correctly."
    choices:
    - content: "`int x = 12.3m;`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "An `int` can't be set to a literal decimal value."
    - content: "`string x = 12.3m;`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "A `string` can't be set to a literal decimal value."
    - content: "`decimal x = 12.3m;`"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct!"
    - content: "`bool x = 'False';`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The first problem is that you can't use a single-quote to create a `string` literal.  The second problem is that you can't set a `bool` to a `string` or `char` literal."
