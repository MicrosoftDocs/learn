In this module, you’ll start taking your first steps with Go. First, you’ll begin by learning a little bit about Go’s history and the main features of this programming language. Then, you’ll be installing and configuring Go on your workstation. Additionally, you’ll explore another way you can play with Go without having to install anything on your workstation. You’ll also learn how Go requires you to organize your code so that you don’t have any problems building them when you need to develop complex applications.

At the end of the module, you’ll create your first “Hello World!” application in Go, and you’ll be ready to continue learning more about how to build applications using Go.
