You can use any text editor to write Go applications, but when you use an IDE like Visual Studio Code (VS Code), you write code faster. Without an IDE, you’d have to write every line from scratch, which at the beginning could help to get familiar with the syntax, but in the long-term, you might need more time to write an application. Therefore, we recommend using an IDE. For instance, you could start using VS Code, which is free and open-source, which has an extension for Go to help you write code faster.

When you have VS Code and the Go extension, you get the following benefits:

- Format applications following Go standards
- Add package references as soon as you add a new line and save your code.
- Remove package references that your application is not using anymore.
- Debug your applications by allowing you to set breakpoints and use watchers at runtime
- Provides suggested completions for code and package references
- Hover information to get more details about the code referencing its documentation
- Provides signature help like listing the parameters a function has
- Navigate the project’s code easily when you have multiple files
- Support for testing like generating test skeletons for functions

Below are the instructions to install Visual Studio Code on your workstation.

## Install the Go extension for Visual Studio Code
The Go extension for VS Code will help you write Go apps more efficiently because you’ll enjoy all of the features we mentioned early regarding why it’s a good idea to use an IDE for developing Go apps.

Open VS Code, in case you haven’t done it already.

**Step 1: Open the Extensions view**
In VS Code, go to “View” and select “Extensions” from the menu bar, or select the “Extensions” icon from the left side of the screen.

**Step 2: Search for the Go extension**
Enter “Go” in the search box at the top of the Extensions view.

**Step 3: Install the Go extensions**
Below the extension’s description, you’ll see an **Install** button; click on it to install the extension in your workstation. When the installation is complete, the button’s text will change to **Uninstall**, meaning that you’ve successfully installed the Go extension.
