Open-source content on Microsoft Learn depends on the collaborative efforts of a large community of passionate contributors. Microsoft Learn is the platform that hosts all technical documentation for Microsoft products, plus training modules, Shows, Q&A, and much more! Contributions from experts in the field, content authors, product users, students, and other Microsoft enthusiasts help learners build skills to achieve more and explore new possibilities.
