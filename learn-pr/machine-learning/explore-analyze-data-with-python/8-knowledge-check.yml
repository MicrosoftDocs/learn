quiz:
  questions:
  - content: "You have a NumPy array with the shape (2,20). What does this tell you about the elements in the array?"
    choices:
    - content: "The array is two dimensional, consisting of two arrays each with 20 elements"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That is correct. A shape of (2,20) indicates a multidimensional array with two arrays, each containing 20 elements."
    - content: "The array contains 2 elements, with the values 2 and 20"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That is incorrect. A shape of (2,20) indicates a multidimensional array with two arrays, each containing 20 elements."
    - content: "The array contains 20 elements, all with the value 2"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That is incorrect. A shape of (2,20) indicates a multidimensional array with two arrays, each containing 20 elements."
  - content: "You have a Pandas DataFrame named df_sales containing daily sales data. The DataFrame contains the following columns: year, month, day_of_month, sales_total. You want to find the average sales_total value. Which code should you use?"
    choices:
    - content: "df_sales['sales_total'].avg()"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That is incorrect. Use the mean() method of the columns to return the average."
    - content: "df_sales['sales_total'].mean()"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That is correct. This code will return the average of the sales_total column values."
    - content: "mean(df_sales['sales_total'])"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That is incorrect. Use the mean() method of the columns to return the average."
  - content: "You have a DataFrame containing data about daily ice cream sales. You use the corr method to compare the avg_temp and units_sold columns, and get a result of 0.97. What does this result indicate?"
    choices:
    - content: "On the day with the maximum units_sold value, the avg_temp value was 0.97"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That is incorrect. The corr method returns the correlation between two numeric columns."
    - content: "Days with high avg_temp values tend to coincide with days that have high units_sold values"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That is correct. The corr method returns the correlation, and a value near 1 indicates a positive correlation."
    - content: "The units_sold value is, on average, 97% of the avg_temp value"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That is incorrect. The corr method returns the correlation between two numeric columns."
