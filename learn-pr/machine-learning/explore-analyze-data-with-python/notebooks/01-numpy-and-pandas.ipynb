    "A significant part of a a data scientist's role is to explore, analyze, and visualize data. There are many tools and programming languages that they can use to do this. One of the most popular approaches is to use Jupyter notebooks (like this one) and Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a flexible programming language that's used in a wide range of scenarios, from web applications to device programming. It's extremely popular in the data-science and machine-learning communities because of the many packages it supports for data analysis and visualization.\n",

This isn't intended to be a comprehensive Python programming exercise or even a deep dive into data analysis. Rather, it's intended as a crash course in some of the common ways in which data scientists can use Python to work with data.\n",

    "> \n",
    "> - Notebooks are made up of *cells*. Some cells (like this one) contain *markdown* text, while others (like the one following this one) contain code.\n",
    "> - You can run each code cell by using the **&#9658; Run** button. The **&#9658; Run** button shows up when you hover over the cell.\n",
    "> - The output from each code cell is displayed immediately below the cell.\n",
    "> - Even though you can run the code cells individually, some variables the code uses are global to the notebook. That means that you should run all of the code cells <u>**in order**</u>. There might be dependencies between code cells, so if you skip a cell, subsequent cells might not run correctly.\n",
