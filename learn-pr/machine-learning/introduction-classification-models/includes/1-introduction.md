Classification is a form of machine learning in which you train a model to predict which category an item belongs to. For example, a health clinic might use diagnostic data such as a patient's height, weight, blood pressure, or blood-glucose level to predict whether the patient is diabetic.

Categorical data has distinct *classes*, rather than numeric values. Some kinds of data can be either numeric or categorical. For example, race completion times could be measured in seconds or minutes, or the times could be separated into classes called *fast*, *medium*, and *slow*. Other kinds of data can only be categorical. For example, a shape can be categorized only as, say, *circle*, *triangle*, or *square*.
