quiz:
  questions:
  - content: You have a tibble, or data frame, with the dimension 20, 2. What does this information tell you about it? 
    choices:
    - content: The tibble consists of 20 rows and 2 columns.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct! A dimension of 20, 2 means that the tibble has 2 columns, each with 20 elements. This information gives it a rectangular structure of 20 rows and 2 columns. 
    - content: The tibble contains 2 columns, with the values 2 and 20.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. A dimension of 20, 2 means that the tibble has 2 columns, each with 20 elements. This information gives it a rectangular structure of 20 rows and 2 columns. 
    - content: The tibble contains 20 rows, all with the value 2.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. A dimension of 20, 2 means that the tibble has 2 columns, each with 20 elements. This information gives it a rectangular structure of 20 rows and 2 columns.
  - content: You have a data frame named df_sales, which contains daily sales data. The data frame displays columns for year, month, day_of_month, and sales_total. You want to find the average sales_total value. Which code should you use? 
    choices:
    - content: df_sales %>% pull(sales_total) %>% avg()
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. Use the mean() function and not avg() to return the average. 
    - content: mean(sales_total$df_sales)
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. The accessor (`$`) is used to extract a single column of a data frame. The data frame is at the left of the operator.
    - content: mean(df_sales$sales_total)
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct! The accessor (`$`) extracts the elements in the sales_total column of df_sales data frame. The elements are then passed on to the mean() function, which computes the average.  
  - content: You have a data frame that displays data about daily ice cream sales. You use the R function cor to compare the avg_temp and units_sold columns, and you get a result of 0.97. What does this result indicate?
    choices:
    - content: On the day with the maximum units_sold value, the avg_temp value was 0.97.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. The cor function returns the correlation between two numeric columns.
    - content: Days with high avg_temp values tend to coincide with days that have high units_sold values.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct! The cor function returns the correlation, and a value near 1 indicates a positive correlation. 
    - content: The units_sold value is, on average, 97 percent of the avg_temp value.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. The cor function returns the correlation between two numeric columns.
