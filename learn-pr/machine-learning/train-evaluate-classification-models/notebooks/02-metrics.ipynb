    "In the last notebook we used a binary classifier to predict whether patients were diabetic or not. We used *accuracy*, the proportion of how many cases were predicted correctly, as a measure of how well the model performed, but accuracy isn't everything. In this notebook, we will look at alternatives to accuracy that can be much more useful in machine learning.\n",

    "Accuracy seems like a sensible metric to evaluate (and to a certain extent it is), but you need to be careful about drawing too many conclusions from the accuracy of a classifier. Suppose only 3% of the population is diabetic. You could create a classifier that just always predicts 0, and it would be 97% accurate - but not terribly helpful in identifying patients with diabetes!\n",
