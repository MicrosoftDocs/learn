    "*Classification* is a form of supervised machine learning in which you train a model to use the features (the ***x*** values in our function) to predict a label (***y***) that calculates the probability of the observed case belonging to each of a number of possible classes, and predicting an appropriate label. The simplest form of classification is *binary* classification, in which the label is 0 or 1, representing one of two classes; for example, \"True\" or \"False\", \"Internal\" or \"External\", \"Profitable\" or \"Non-Profitable\", and so on. \n",
