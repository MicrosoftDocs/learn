    "# Multiclass Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "In the last notebook, we looked at binary classification. This works well when the data observations belong to one of two classes or categories, such as \"True\" or \"False\". When the data is categorized into more than two classes, you'll need a multiclass classification algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiclass classification can be a combination of multiple binary classifiers. There are two ways to approach this problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **One vs Rest (OVR)**, in which a classifier is created for each possible class value, with a positive outcome for cases where the prediction is *this* class, and negative predictions for cases where the prediction is any other class. A classification problem with four possible shape classes (*square*, *circle*, *triangle*, *hexagon*) would require four classifiers that predict:\n",
    "    - *square* or not\n",
    "    - *circle* or not\n",
    "    - *triangle* or not\n",
    "    - *hexagon* or not\n",
    "    \n",
    "- **One vs One (OVO)**, in which a classifier for each possible pair of classes is created. The classification problem with four shape classes would require the following binary classifiers:\n",
    "    - *square* or *circle*\n",
    "    - *square* or *triangle*\n",
    "    - *square* or *hexagon*\n",
    "    - *circle* or *triangle*\n",
    "    - *circle* or *hexagon*\n",
    "    - *triangle* or *hexagon*\n",
    "\n",
    "In both approaches, the overall model that combines the classifiers generates a vector of predictions, in which the probabilities generated from the individual binary classifiers are used to determine which class to predict.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, in most machine learning frameworks, including Scikit-Learn, implementing a multiclass classification model is not significantly more complex than binary classification - and in most cases, the estimators used for binary classification implicitly support multiclass classification by abstracting an OVR algorithm, an OVO algorithm, or by allowing a choice of either.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **More Information**: To learn more about estimator support for multiclass classification in Scikit-Learn, see the [Scikit-Learn documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/multiclass.html).\n",
