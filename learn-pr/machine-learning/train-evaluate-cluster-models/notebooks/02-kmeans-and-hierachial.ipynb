    "4. Steps 2 and 3 are repeated until a stopping criteria is met. Typically, the algorithm terminates when each new iteration results in negligible movement of centroids and the clusters become static.\n",
    "5. When the clusters stop changing, the algorithm has *converged*, defining the locations of the clusters. Note that the random starting point for the centroids means that re-running the algorithm could result in slightly different clusters, so training usually involves multiple iterations, re-initializing the centroids each time, and the model with the best WCSS (*within cluster sum of squares*) is selected.\n",
