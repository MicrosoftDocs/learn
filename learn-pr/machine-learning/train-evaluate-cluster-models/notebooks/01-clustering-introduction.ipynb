    "# Clustering - Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast to *supervised* machine learning, *unsupervised* learning is used when there is no \"ground truth\" from which to train and validate label predictions. The most common form of unsupervised learning is *clustering*, which is similar conceptually to *classification*, except that the the training data does not include known values for the class label to be predicted. Clustering works by separating the training cases based on similarities that can be determined from their feature values. Think of it this way; the numeric features of a given entity can be thought of as vector coordinates that define the entity's position in n-dimensional space. What a clustering model seeks to do is to identify groups, or *clusters*, of entities that are close to one another while being separated from other clusters.\n",

    "Now, of course six-dimensional space is difficult to visualise in a three-dimensional world, or on a two-dimensional plot; so we'll take advantage of a mathematical technique called *Principal Component Analysis* (PCA) to analyze the relationships between the features and summarize each observation as coordinates for two principal components - in other words, we'll translate the six-dimensional feature values into two-dimensional coordinates."

    "Hopefully you can see at least two, arguably three, reasonably distinct groups of data points; but here lies one of the fundamental problems with clustering - without known class labels, how do you know how many clusters to separate your data into?\n",
    "\n",
    "One way we can try to find out is to use a data sample to create a series of clustering models with an incrementing number of clusters, and measure how tightly the data points are grouped within each cluster. A metric often used to measure this tightness is the *within cluster sum of squares* (WCSS), with lower values meaning that the data points are closer. You can then plot the WCSS for each model."
