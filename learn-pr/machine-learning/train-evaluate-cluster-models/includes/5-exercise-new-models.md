Let's get started with clustering in a notebook.

> [!NOTE]
> In this exercise, you'll use a lightweight Python notebook tool that's been developed specifically for this training. The notebook tool runs in your browser, so there's no need to install anything or sign into a cloud service. You just need a modern browser, like Microsoft Edge, with JavaScript enabled.

Launch the exercise and follow the instructions.
