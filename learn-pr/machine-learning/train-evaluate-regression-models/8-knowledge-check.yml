quiz:
  questions:
  - content: "You're using scikit-learn to train a regression model from a dataset of sales data. You want to be able to evaluate the model to ensure it predicts accurately with new data. What should you do?"
    choices:
    - content: "Use all of the data to train the model. Then use all of the data to evaluate it"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Training and evaluating the model using the same data won't tell you if the model generalizes well."
    - content: "Train the model using only the feature columns, and then evaluate it using only the label column"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. You need both features and labels to train and evaluate a regression model."
    - content: "Split the data randomly into two subsets. Use one subset to train the model, and the other to evaluate it"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. A common way to train and evaluate models is to hold back an evaluation dataset when training."
  - content: "You have created a model object using the scikit-learn LinearRegression class. What should you do to train the model?"
    choices:
    - content: "Call the predict() method of the model object, specifying the training feature and label arrays"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. To train a model, use the fit() method."
    - content: "Call the fit() method of the model object, specifying the training feature and label arrays"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. To train a model, use the fit() method."
    - content: "Call the score() method of the model object, specifying the training feature and test feature arrays"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. To train a model, use the fit() method."
  - content: "You train a regression model using scikit-learn. When you evaluate it with test data, you determine that the model achieves an R-squared metric of 0.95. What does this metric tell you about the model?"
    choices:
    - content: "The model explains most of the variance between predicted and actual values."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The R-squared metric is a measure of how much of the variance the model can explain."
    - content: "The model is 95% accurate"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The R-squared metric is a measure of how much of the variance the model can explain."
    - content: "On average, predictions are 0.95 higher than actual values"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The R-squared metric is a measure of how much of the variance can be explained by the model."
