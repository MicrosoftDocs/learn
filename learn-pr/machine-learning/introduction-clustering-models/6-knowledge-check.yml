  questions:
  - content: K-means clustering is an example of which kind of machine learning?
    choices:
    - content: Unsupervised machine learning.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: That's correct. Clustering is a form of unsupervised machine learning in which the training data does not include known labels. 
    - content: Supervised machine learning.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: That's incorrect. Supervised machine learning requires a known label for training.
    - content: Reinforcement learning.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: That's incorrect. Reinforcement learning is an advanced form of machine learning, in which models learn to apply actions based on rewards. 
  - content: You're using the built-in `kmeans()` function in R to train a K-means clustering model that groups observations into three clusters. How should you create the object of class `kmeans` to specify that you want to obtain three clusters? 
    choices:
    - content: kclust <- kmeans(nstart = 3)
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: That's incorrect. The `nstart` parameter determines how many random initial configuration sets should be chosen, and reports on the best one. 
    - content: kclust <- kmeans(iter.max = 3)
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: That's incorrect. The `iter.max` parameter determines the maximum number of algorithm iterations used for cluster assignment. 
    - content: kclust <- kmeans(centers = 3) 
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: That's correct. The `centers` parameter determines the number of clusters, k.
