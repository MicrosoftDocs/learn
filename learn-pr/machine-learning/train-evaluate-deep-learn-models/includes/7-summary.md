In this module you learned about the fundamental principles of deep learning, and how to create deep neural network models using PyTorch or Tensorflow. You also explored the use of convolutional neural networks to create image classification models.

Deep learning techniques are at the cutting edge of machine learning and artificial intelligence, and are used to implement enterprise solutions. If this module has inspired you to build machine learning solutions, you should consider learning how Azure Machine Learning can help you train, deploy, and manage models at scale. You can learn how to use Azure Machine Learning to manage machine learning operations in the [Build AI solutions with Azure Machine Learning service](/learn/paths/build-ai-solutions-with-azure-ml-service/) learning path.
