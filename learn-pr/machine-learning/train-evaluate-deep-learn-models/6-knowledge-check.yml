quiz:
  questions:
  - content: "You are creating a deep neural network to train a classification model that predicts to which of three classes an observation belongs based on 10 numeric features. Which of the following statements is true of the network architecture?"
    choices:
    - content: "The input layer should contain three nodes"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The input layer should contain a node for each feature."
    - content: "The network should contain three hidden layers"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The number of hidden layers is not constrained by the number of class labels."
    - content: "The output layer should contain three nodes"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The output layer should contain a node for each possible class value."
  - content: "You are training a deep neural network. You configure the training process to use 50 epochs. What effect does this configuration have?"
    choices:
    - content: "The entire training dataset is passed through the network 50 times"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The number of epochs determines the number of training passes for the full dataset."
    - content: "The training data is split into 50 subsets, and each subset is passed through the network"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. To split the data into subsets, you use a batch size parameter."
    - content: "The first 50 rows of data are used to train the model, and the remaining rows are used to validate it"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The number of epochs determines the number of training passes for the full dataset."
  - content: "You are creating a deep neural network. You increase the Learning Rate parameter. What effect does this setting have?"
    choices:
    - content: "More records are included in each batch passed through the network"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The number of records per batch is controlled by the Batch Size parameter."
    - content: "Larger adjustments are made to weight values during backpropagation"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Increasing the learning rate causes backpropagation to make larger weight adjustments."
    - content: "More hidden layers are added to the network"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Learning Rate does not affect the number of network layers."
  - content: "You are creating a convolutional neural network. You want to reduce the size of the feature maps that are generated by a convolutional layer. What should you do?"
    choices:
    - content: "Reduce the size of the filter kernel used in the convolutional layer"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Reducing the size of the filter for a convolutional layer does not reduce the number of features it generates."
    - content: "Increase the number of filters in the convolutional layer"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Increasing the number of filters would increase the number of feature maps."
    - content: "Add a pooling layer after the convolutional layer"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. A pooling layer reduces the number of features in a feature map."
