This unit provides an overview of a few Azure AI services that are useful to know when you build and deploy an edge AI solution with Azure Percept.

## Introduction to AI

Artificial intelligence (AI) is the creation of software that imitates human behaviors and capabilities, such as visual sense, speech recognition, decision-making, and natural language understanding.

**Use AI for**:

- **Machine learning**: This is often the foundation for an AI system and the way we "teach" a computer model to make predictions and draw conclusions from data.

- **Anomaly detection**: The capability to automatically detect errors or unusual activity in a system.

- **Computer vision**: The capability of software to interpret the world visually through cameras, videos, and images.

- **Natural language processing**: The capability of a computer to interpret written or spoken language and respond in kind.

- **Knowledge mining**: The capability to extract information from large volumes of often unstructured data and create a searchable knowledge store.

## Introduction to Azure AI: Computer Vision

Computer Vision is an area of AI in which software systems are designed to perceive the world visually, through cameras, images, and videos. There are many specific types of computer vision problems AI engineers and data scientists can solve using a mix of custom machine learning models and platform-as-a-service (PaaS) solutions, including many cognitive services in Microsoft Azure.

**Use Computer Vision for**:

- **Content Organization**: Identify people or objects in photos and organize them based on that identification. Photo recognition applications like this are commonly used in photo storage and social media applications.

- **Text Extraction**: Analyze images and PDF documents that contain text and extract the text into a structured format.

- **Spatial Analysis**: Identify people or objects, such as cars, in a space and map their movement within that space.
