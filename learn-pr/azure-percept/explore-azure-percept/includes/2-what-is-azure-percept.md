Azure Percept is a comprehensive, fully integrated, easy-to-use platform with added security for solution builders and developers of all skill levels and technical capability who are looking to create vision and audio edge AI solutions and applications, and to prototype solutions in minutes. It includes hardware accelerators that integrate seamlessly with Azure AI and Azure IoT Services, helps lower development time, reduces the time to ship edge AI hardware and software, and reduces the complexity of operating the solution. 

With Azure Percept, you can:

- **Easily create prototypes and POCs** by building out AI solution prototypes and POCs on edge device DKs, leveraging pre-trained vision AI models, using existing models, or building custom models with Azure Custom Vision integration. You can also leverage existing IP cameras, microphones, and other sensors already deployed in your environment.

- **Reduce development time and complexity** by building vision AI solutions using APIs, SDKs, code extensions, and open-source sample apps that are designed to work seamlessly across Azure Percept-enabled edge devices and Azure AI and IOT services. You can leverage a wide range of certified edge devices and form factors to meet performance needs and use cases including Azure Stack HCI, Nvidia Jetson Orin/Xavier based devices, and Windows IoT based devices, and use existing cameras and video streams to edge devices for real-time AI inferencing at the edge.

- **Streamline deployment and operating at scale**. By using easy container packaging for AI models and applications for easy deployment to edge devices, you can securely deploy those AI model containers and applications across a wide range edge devices hardware configuration. Easily manage and update AI models and applications on edge devices with Percept Studio. Then leverage common Azure services like Azure Monitor, Azure Stream Analytics, and Power BI to aggregate, visualize, and monitor AI insights and results from Percept enabled devices.

- **Ensure security across devices, apps, and data**. Azure Percept platform takes a Zero-Trust approach to securing AI solutions across devices, applications, and data at rest at the edge, in-transit to the cloud, and at-rest in the cloud. You can enable secure edge AI solutions from silicon to service, use Azure Certified Devices and the Edge Secure Core certification to enable devices to connect seamlessly to Azure edge and AI services, manage these devices through Azure so they remain up to date and secure, and ensure edge AI solutions are securely packaged in the right containers and deployed to the intended endpoint.

As shown in the following diagram, Azure Percept's fully integrated platform combines **three primary components** that simplify creating and managing edge AI solutions:

- **Building devices**. The **Azure Percept Edge AI Device Development Kit (DDK)** includes the software, tools, and guidance for designing, building, and supporting Azure edge AI-enabled endpoints. It expedites prototyping so device builders can quickly assemble, train, and deploy ML modules that tackle multiple outcomes, like detecting workplace hazards and shopper analytics.

- **Building solutions**. The **edge AI PaaS** provides the building blocks developers need to reduce the time and complexity of creating and operating edge AI applications with solution, device, and security management capabilities across multiple device types.

- **Certification**. The **Azure Certified Device program** makes it easy to discover and differentiate IoT devices built to run on Azure.

To securely deploy and manage AI resources at the edge, the following three components work together to create an ecosystem scale through third-party or first-party devices and applications:

- Device builders look for the pull-through demand created by these apps. 

- Solution builders need devices built to run their apps. 

- The certification program promises things will "just work."
