quiz:
  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "Suppose you're using a master-detail split view to show a collection of items of the same type. How many instances of the detail page type would you typically create?"
    choices:
    - content: "A single shared detail page"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "If all items are of the same type, rendering their details can be done with a single detail page populated with the selected item's data."
    - content: "One detail page for each item"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "If all items are of the same type, creating unique detail pages for each would be unnecessary, especially if the list might contain an arbitrary number of items."
    - content: "A detail page for every 10 items"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "There's no need to create multiple detail pages for items of the same type."
