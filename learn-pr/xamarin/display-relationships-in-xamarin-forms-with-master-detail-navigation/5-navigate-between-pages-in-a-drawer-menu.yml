quiz:
  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "When you're displaying the master page by using `Popover` behavior, what must be done to the master page after a selected detail page appears?"
    choices:
    - content: "The master page must be hidden again, by using the `IsPresented` property."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Because a `Popover` drawer should be hidden after a user selection, you set `IsPresented` to `false` to hide the drawer."
    - content: "The master page must be properly disposed of via the `Dispose` method."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The master page doesn't require explicit disposal."
    - content: "The master page can remain displayed during `Popover` presentation."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Using `Popover` means that the master page should be removed from display to allow the detail page to occupy the full screen."
  - content: "When the user selects an item in the master page, what must the developer do to present the appropriate page?"
    choices:
    - content: "The appropriate page will be displayed automatically."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Because the `MasterDetailPage` class is flexible in how navigation is handled, handling navigation must be done manually."
    - content: "Write code to load the appropriate page."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "It's your responsibility to handle any events in the master page and manually present the appropriate page by assigning the `Detail` property."
    - content: "Handle the `MasterDetailPage.PageSelected` event and load the appropriate page."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "No events are built into the `MasterDetailPage` class directly."
