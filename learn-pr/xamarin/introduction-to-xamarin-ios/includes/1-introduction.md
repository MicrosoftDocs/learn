Today, users expect devices to always be connected and have access to data. They use their devices for everything from checking the temperature of their home while they're on vacation to getting live updates for the arrival of a taxi or flight.

Users need their data to be relevant, detailed, and readily available across multiple devices. And they're not used for just work. People use smart devices in many aspects of their lives. That's why the applications that run on these devices need to work everywhere - across devices, network types, and country borders.

Suppose you're working at a service delivery company. You want to create a mobile application that lets your customers process payments. You decide to focus first on a tip calculator feature. The app helps your users by calculating the tip and showing the total amount due.

You're a .NET developer and plan to create an iOS application. You can use Xamarin.iOS and take advantage of hardware and software features provided by Apple.

The first step in becoming a Xamarin.iOS developer is getting an application up and running. This module shows you how you can use Xamarin.iOS to create an iOS application. The goal is to help you decide if Xamarin.iOS is a good choice for your business.
