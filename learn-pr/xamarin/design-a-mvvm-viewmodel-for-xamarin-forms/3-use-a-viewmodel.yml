quiz:
    title: Check your knowledge
    questions:
    - content: "When using the MVVM pattern with Xamarin.Forms, your model, view, and viewmodel won't be completely decoupled from each other. Which choice describes one common dependency between the MVVM pieces?"
      choices:
      - content: "The viewmodel has direct knowledge of the model."
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "Correct. The viewmodel can access properties and methods on the model directly."
      - content: "The model has direct knowledge of the viewmodel."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect. The model has no awareness of the platform or viewmodel."
      - content: "The viewmodel has direct knowledge of the view."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect. The viewmodel just exposes properties. It's up to the view to access and bind to these properties."
    - content: "Which is mostly likely to be tightly coupled to the platform and difficult to create unit tests for: the model, the view, or the viewmodel?"
      choices:
      - content: "The view"
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "Correct. In Xamarin.Forms, the view is often primarily implemented by XAML, but it's difficult to unit test, even if coded."
      - content: "The model"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect. The model should be just business logic classes and not be coupled to the platform, view, or viewmodel."
      - content: "The viewmodel"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect. The viewmodel exposes properties that can be consumed by the view. But it shouldn't be tightly coupled to the platform."
