quiz:
  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "How do you dynamically add a new item to a `ListView` control?"
    choices:
    - content: "Add the new item directly to the `ListView` control by using a built-in `Add` method."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "A `ListView` control doesn't directly expose any methods to add or remove items."
    - content: "Add the new item to the collection that was assigned to the `ItemsSource` property."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "To modify the dataset of a `ListView` control in any way, use the collection that was assigned to its `ItemsSource` property."
    - content: "Use the `ContentPage` instance's built-in `Add` method."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "`ContentPage` offers no methods to modify the dataset of a `ListView` control."
  - content: "Which interface does `ObservableCollection` implement?"
    choices:
    - content: "`INotifyPropertyChanged`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "`INotifyPropertyChanged` notifies the user interface when a property changes. It doesn't notify the user interface about collections."
    - content: "`INotifyDataChanged`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "`INotifyDataChanged` isn't a valid interface."
    - content: "`INotifyCollectionChanged`"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "`ObservableCollection` implements `INotifyCollectionChanged` to let the `ListView` control know that something changed and that it should update itself visually."
