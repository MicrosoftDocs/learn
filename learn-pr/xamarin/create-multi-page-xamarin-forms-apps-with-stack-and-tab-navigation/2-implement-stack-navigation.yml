  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "When is stack navigation a good choice for an app?"
    choices:
    - content: "You have only a few pages in your app and the pages all have equal importance."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Stack navigation is a better match when pages are hierarchical rather than of equal importance."
    - content: "The app's pages tend to be traversed from general to more specific."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Stack navigation gives the user a natural way to dig progressively deeper into an app. Each level typically provides more specific details."
    - content: "The app's pages require extensive scrolling."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The use of stack navigation is unrelated to the scrolling requirements of the pages it presents."
  - content: "Which property of the Xamarin.Forms `Page` class provides access to stack navigation functionality?"
    choices:
    - content: "`Navigation`"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "The `Navigation` property lets you access the `PushAsync` and `PopAsync` methods of the app's `NavigationPage`."
    - content: "`Stack`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The navigation stack is accessible; however, it has a different name and doesn't offer push and pop methods you'd use for navigation."
    - content: "`Page` offers `PushAsync` and `PopAsync` methods directly."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The stack navigation methods aren't part of the `Page` class."
