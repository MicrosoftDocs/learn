quiz:
  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "How are modal pages typically visible to the user in relation to the original page that showed the modal page?"
    choices:
    - content: "Side-by-side with the current page, allowing interaction with both the modal and original content."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The original page and the modal page aren't sibling pages that both need to be visible."
    - content: "Above the current page, preventing interaction with the presenting page."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Modal pages block interaction with the current page until they're dismissed."
    - content: "As a system notification that appears, and then disappears, when a timer expires."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Modal pages are app content, not system notifications."
  - content: "To dismiss a modal page currently being presented, which method would you call from the Navigation API?"
    choices:
    - content: "`PopAsync`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This method dismisses a non-modal page."
    - content: "`PushModalAsync`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This method shows a modal page."
    - content: "`PopModalAsync`"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "This method dismisses the currently presented modal page."
  - content: "How does the user dismiss a modal page?"
    choices:
    - content: "There's no standard way. The developer must add some UI to the page that allows the user to dismiss the page."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Without some additional UI, the user can't dismiss a modal page."
    - content: "Presenting a modal page will automatically add a platform-specific close button that the user can select to dismiss the page."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "By default, modal pages don't include any UI to dismiss them. You must include some UI, such as a button, that calls `PopModalAsync` on the currently displayed modal page."
    - content: "Modal pages will be dismissed automatically after five (5) seconds."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The purpose of modal pages is to require some user interaction. Modal pages don't dismiss automatically."
