By using Xamarin.Forms effects, app developers can customize and add functionality to Xamarin.Forms elements. Effects provide access to the underlying native platforms, such as iOS and Android. Effects work *with* renderers and are ordinarily easier to code and more reusable than building custom renderers.

Suppose you've been hired to build an app by using Xamarin.Forms. The specifications for the app were already created by a graphic designer. They include some elements that aren't directly supported in Xamarin.Forms, such as drop shadows, custom fonts, and background color gradients. This isn't a problem, though, because you can use Xamarin.Forms effects to add the functionality you need. Anything that's supported by the underlying native controls can be accessed with effects.
