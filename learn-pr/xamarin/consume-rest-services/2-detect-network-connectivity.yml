quiz:
  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "Which of the following is the best reason to check if you're connected to the internet before running network code?"
    choices:
    - content: "You don't want to waste resources by performing operations that aren't going to do anything."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "If you don't add code to check your network connection, it causes your application to stop responding and all resources are freed."
    - content: "To provide a great user experience."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "If you add code to detect whether you have a connection to the internet, it ensures that your application won't stop responding and provide a bad experience if you don't have a connection."
  - content: "Suppose you use an application while driving in your car. As you enter a tunnel, you lose internet connection. Which member of the Connectivity class do you use to detect the change in network connection?"
    choices:
    - content: "The NetworkAccess property"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The NetworkAccess property informs you if you're connected to the internet, but it's just a simple enumeration. This means that you have to create a polling system to detect when you lost connection while driving through the tunnel."
    - content: "The ConnectivityChanged event"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "You can subscribe to the ConnectivityChanged event and as soon as your network connection changes, you're notified about it."
