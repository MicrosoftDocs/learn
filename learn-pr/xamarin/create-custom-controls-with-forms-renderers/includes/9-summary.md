Platform renderers are the main tool that Xamarin.Forms uses to make user interface elements work on different platforms. The elements that ship with Xamarin.Forms include renderers for all supported platforms, and you can customize them when you need more specific behavior. You can also create new elements in Xamarin.Forms and enable them to work on multiple platforms by providing renderers for those platforms.

In this module, we modified a drawing app to enable its label to show a drop shadow by extending the existing `Label` renderer. We also added drawing functionality that's not available in the standard Xamarin.Forms controls by creating a new element and platform renderers. Finally, we added the ability to send notifications between Xamarin.Forms elements and the platform renderers.
