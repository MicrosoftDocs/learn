    title: Check your knowledge
    questions:
    - content: "When coding a custom renderer in Xamarin.Forms, which renderer method should be overridden to do initialization like creating the native control, setting native properties, and so on?"
      choices:
      - content: "`OnElementPropertyChanged`"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "`OnElementPropertyChanged` is called when a bindable property or an attached property value changes on the associated Xamarin.Forms element."
      - content: "`OnCreate`"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "The renderer doesn't have an `OnCreate` method to override."
      - content: "`OnElementChanged`"
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "The `OnElementChanged` method is used to render the native control, which is called when the corresponding Xamarin.Forms control is created."
    - content: "What's the most common way to pass data between a Xamarin.Forms `View` and a custom renderer that requires data passed from the `View`?"
      choices:
      - content: "Standard CLR properties"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Standard CLR properties don't provide property change notifications."
      - content: "Bindable properties"
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "Bindable properties are the most common method used to implement property change notification."
      - content: "Public fields"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Public fields don't provide property change notifications."
    - content: "The Xamarin.Forms renderer has access to both the Xamarin.Forms view and the native view. What's the name of the property in the renderer that provides access to the Xamarin.Forms view?"
      choices:
      - content: "`Element`"
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "The `Element` property provides access to the Xamarin.Forms view associated with a custom renderer."
      - content: "`Control`"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "The `Control` property provides access to the native control associated with a custom renderer."
      - content: "`View`"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "There is no `View` property on the base renderer class."
    - content: "When coding a custom Xamarin.Forms `View` and custom renderer that require notifications between each other, what's the advantage of using the messaging service?"
      choices:
      - content: "More efficient than a direct method call."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "The messaging service typically relies on event invocation, which results in method calls. The messaging service isn't necessarily faster than direct method calls."
      - content: "Requires no cleanup code."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "The messaging service is a subscription-based service. All subscribers have to unsubscribe from the service. Cleanup is still required."
      - content: "Loose coupling between the `View` and the renderer."
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "Loosely coupled notification code between the `View` and the renderer prevents you from writing code that can lead to memory leaks in your app."
