  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "Which is true of the source object in a Xamarin.Forms binding?"
    choices:
    - content: "It can be any type."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "The source object can be any type."
    - content: "It must be a `BindableObject`."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The source doesn't need to be a `BindableObject`"
    - content: "It must be a subclass of `View`."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The source doesn't need to be a `View`."
  - content: "Which is true of the target property in Xamarin.Forms binding?"
    choices:
    - content: "It can be any public property."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The source path can be any public property, but the target has restrictions."
    - content: "It must be a `BindableProperty`."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "The target property must be a `BindableProperty`."
    - content: "It must be a `DependencyProperty`."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Xamarin.Forms doesn't use the type `DependencyProperty`."
  - content: "If all the bindings on controls within a `StackLayout` use the same source object, what is the safest strategy to set the source object only once?"
    choices:
    - content: "Set the `Page`'s `BindingContext` property."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Setting the `BindingContext` at the `Page` level might not work as intended. There might be a non-null `BindingContext` lower in the visual tree that would take precedence over the object set at the `Page` level."
    - content: "Set the `Page`'s `Source` property."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "`Page` doesn't have a `Source` property."
    - content: "Set the `StackLayout`'s `BindingContext` property."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Setting the `BindingContext` on the `StackLayout` is the safest choice. There's no chance a different `BindingContext` will be used as the source for the bindings."
