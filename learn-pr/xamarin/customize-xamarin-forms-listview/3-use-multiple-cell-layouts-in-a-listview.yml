    title: Check your knowledge
    questions:
    - content: "What does a `DataTemplateSelector` allow you to do?"
      choices:
      - content: "Build `DataTemplate` instances in code."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "You can create `DataTemplate` instances in code, using `ViewCell` objects that are defined either in code or in XAML. You don't need to use a `DataTemplateSelector`."
      - content: "Return a different `DataTemplate` depending on the row."
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "A `DataTemplateSelector` lets you return a different `DataTemplate` for each element in the source collection."
      - content: "Provide row selection handling in your `DataTemplate`."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "`DataTemplateSelector` objects don't provide row selection."
      - content: "Load default cell styles automatically."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "`DataTemplateSelector` objects don't work directly with styles."
    - content: "How many `DataTemplate` instances should a `DataTemplateSelector` create?"
      choices:
      - content: "One. Share an instance of `DataTemplate` and reset the `CellType` property when you return each record."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "You shouldn't share a `DataTemplate` instance across records that use different `ViewCell` instances."
      - content: "One per cell type. Records with the same cell type should return the same `DataTemplate` instance."
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "For the best performance, you should use one instance of `DataTemplate` for each `ViewCell` that you need."
      - content: "One per record. Instantiate and return a `DataTemplate` with the correct cell type."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "For the best performance, a `DataTemplateSelector` shouldn't return a new instance each time."
