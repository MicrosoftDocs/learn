Suppose you work for a power utility company as a mobile developer. You're responsible for improving the company's customer facing mobile app. Currently the app's UI is built using C# code. However, you've started to notice it's becoming more difficult to manage UI updates. This additional maintenance is because the app is getting more complex. It's difficult to read the core behavior logic as it's mixed in with UI code.

You want to find a solution that will introduce clean separation of UI and behavior. Separation of UI and behavior will allow your design expert to focus on what they do best, and you'll have time to focus on coding the behavior of the app. Xamarin.Forms lets you define your UI using the E**X**tensible **A**pplication **M**arkup **L**anguage (XAML). XAML gives you a clean separation of user interface (UI) and behavior. XAML also makes it easier to use a design expert and design tools. In this module, you'll learn how to create Xamarin.Forms app that defines its pages and controls using XAML instead of C# code. Creating UI on XAML will allow you to separate all your UI code from your behavior code to make it easier to manage both.
