quiz:
  questions:
  
  - content: "Suppose you have recently recovered from a bug in your retail app that resulted in users being unable to place any orders. What service might help you prevent a regression on this issue where you deploy a new release with the same problem?"
    choices:
    - content: "Continuous integration"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Continuous integration will help you build your app with each development change, but will not test for regressions."
    - content: "Automated user interface tests"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Creating a repeatable test run that steps through the process of placing an order would allow you to run those tests before allowing a deployment to be released."
    - content: "Diagnostics"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "While diagnostics might tell you that the new error has returned after your users have the new release, it will not prevent you from deploying the regression before users see it."

  - content: "You have integrated the App Center SDK into your app to collect crash data. Assuming the user has allowed this data to be collected, where in App Center will the data show up after crash data is received?"
    choices:
    - content: "Diagnostics"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Diagnostics will show you the crash, grouped with other related crashes."
    - content: "Analytics"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Analytics will show you the session and demographic data related to your app, as well as events you send back to App Center, but not the crash information."
    - content: "Distribute"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The Distribute section is for releasing app builds to various groups of users and app stores. It will not show crash information."
