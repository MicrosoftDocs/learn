Delivering a quality mobile app is challenging. You need to know how your app is being used. You also need to be able to find and fix issues your user's encounter. When you fix those issues, you need to test and publish your app quickly to get the latest release to customers as soon as possible. How do you go from code change to testers to end-users quickly and automatically? You use continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD) system.

Suppose you work at an athletic shoe company. You sell your shoes through a mobile shopping app. A recent update is preventing users from placing orders. If you had a continuous integration system that executes tests to validate customer use cases, you might have caught this issue before it was published to an app store.

The same day you discover the issue with your ordering system, a developer has quickly solved the problem with a few changes to the app's code. By adding a test suite to verify the use case is working, you can help prevent future regressions. The continuous integration system can run these tests every time a change is ready to be deployed. Additionally, the continuous integration can be coordinated with a continuous delivery system to take the fixed code and build app deliverables for internal and public beta testers and confirm that the issue is resolved on user devices. Finally, when you are sure the app is ready for the general public, your continuous delivery system can automatically submit the new build to your desired app stores for review and release.

Here, you'll create a Visual Studio App Center account to get you started. You'll also be introduced to the services that App Center can provide for your apps. For example:

* Build app releases
* Run unit and on-device tests
* Deliver apps to testers
* Publish apps to app stores
* Collect analytics and diagnostics data
* Send push notifications

## Learning objectives

In this module, you will:

* Evaluate whether App Center is appropriate to help improve your mobile development processes
* Describe how the App Center services can help create development processes to deliver quality mobile apps efficiently

## Prerequisites

* None
