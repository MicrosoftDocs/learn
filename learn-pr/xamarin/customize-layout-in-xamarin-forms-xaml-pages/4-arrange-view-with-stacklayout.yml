quiz:
  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "Which of the following options correctly describes how StackLayout renders the order of its children?"
    choices:
    - content: "The rendered order of the child view is randomly picked."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The StackLayout does not choose the rendered order in a random way. If it did, it would be almost impossible to create a consistent user interface."
    - content: "The rendered order of the child views is based off the Width and Height of the view."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The size of a child view has no impact on the rendered order."
    - content: "The rendered order of the child views is based off the order of the child view in the StackLayout's Children collection."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "The rendered order is based off the order of the child view in the Children collection. For child views that are added in XAML, the rendered order will be the textual order. For child views that are added in code, the rendered order will be the order in which you call the Add method."
  - content: "Which LayoutOptions value would you use to request and fill extra space in a StackLayout"
    choices:
    - content: "StartAndExpand"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "StartAndExpand does request extra space; however, it does not fill the extra space."
    - content: "Fill"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Fill doesn't request extra space."
    - content: "FillAndExpand"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "FillAndExpand will request extra space and fill it."
