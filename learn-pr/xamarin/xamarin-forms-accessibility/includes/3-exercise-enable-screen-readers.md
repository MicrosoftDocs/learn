The first step before implementing accessible features in the app is to turn on the screen reader. Let's walk through how to turn on the screen reader for each operating system to test accessibility in the app.

## Enable screen reader on Android

TalkBack is the primary screen reader used on Android. It is included on most devices, but can also be downloaded directly from the Google Play app store. Enable TalkBack on your device by following these instructions:

1. Open the **Settings** app on your Android device
1. Navigate or search for **Accessibility**
1. Select **TalkBack** from the screen readers section
1. Turn on and off TalkBack by toggling the **User service** setting
1. A confirmation dialog will appear; select **Allow** to enable TalkBack control

## Enable Windows screen reader

Narrator is a screen reader built directly into Windows to enable users to complete common tasks without a mouse. You can enable Narrator in one of two ways:

- Press the **Windows logo key** + **Ctrl** + **Enter** together to start Narrator. Press these keys again to stop Narrator. (On older versions of Windows, the command was the **Windows logo key** + **Enter**.) On many keyboards, the Windows logo key is located on the bottom row of keys, to the left or right of the Alt key.

- Press the **Windows logo key** + **Ctrl** + **N** to open Narrator settings, and then turn on the toggle under Use Narrator.
