[Partner Center](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard) streamlines several business processes so that Microsoft partners can easily manage their relationships with their customers and Microsoft. 

Partner Center is a web-based, unified console that provides access to a wide range of partner-centric activities such as membership, benefits, and account settings, all through a graphical user interface. The portal uses the concept of workspaces to group related tasks and information together.

Whether you're a partner in the Microsoft Cloud Partner Program or a developer selling your apps, you can use Partner Center to manage all aspects of your account. From the Partner Center dashboard, you can see and make changes to information like tenants, business locations, users and permissions, tax information, and specific programs in which your company is enrolled. You can also use Partner Center to complete tasks such as those listed here.

## Enroll in membership programs

The Cloud Partner Program (formerly called the Microsoft Partner Network) is a hub of people, resources, and offerings brought together to give you everything you need to build and deliver successful solutions for your customers.

## Co-sell with Microsoft and other partners

Co-sell is the path for partners to jointly sell with Microsoft and other partners for collaborative, better-together selling and positive customer outcomes. Co-sell lets you use the Microsoft global brand, sales teams, demand-generation capabilities, and the commercial marketplace to reach new customers worldwide.

## Manage customer software needs

As a trusted partner, you play a critical role in all stages of the customer lifecycle, regardless of how customers choose to purchase Microsoft software and services. If your customer gives you administrative privileges, you'll be able to deploy and manage subscriptions, maintain performance, set up users, and create support tickets on their behalf. Partner Center provides quick and easy access to Microsoft support on demand to help you better solve challenges and meet customer needs. Learn more at [Providing different types of support to your customers](/partner-center/customer-support).

## Maintain a secure environment

With Azure Active Directory as a main element of your Partner Center account, ensure your team uses [multifactor authentication](/partner-center/partner-security-requirements-mandating-mfa) to keep data secure. Privacy safeguards and security are among our top priorities.

## Get data and analytics

Partner Center provides a [unified analytics hub](/partner-center/insights-overview) that addresses all your data analytics and business intelligence needs. You can get access to reports, forecasts, and recommendations designed to help you make data-driven decisions for your business.

- Partner Contribution Indicators (PCI) show partner impact on seven key measures of customer success.
- Partner Insights data reports identify where your sales are high, help you find out which customers have deployed their subscriptions or need support, and show how well your products are selling.
