In this module, you explored the critical role of color and contrast in accessibility, emphasizing their importance in creating inclusive and user-friendly designs. You learned about key accessibility requirements, such as ensuring adequate contrast ratios and avoiding reliance on color alone to convey information, as outlined by WCAG standards. The module highlighted the importance of consistently applying these principles throughout the product development cycle, from design to implementation and testing. You also discovered the benefits of high-contrast modes and the use of both automated and manual testing tools to verify accessibility. By integrating these considerations, you can ensure that your digital products are accessible to all users, enhancing both usability and inclusivity.

Make sure to gather all applicable notes, save any resources you want to reference, and reflect on what was learned about this topic.

- Ensure contrast ratios meet WCAG standards for readability and accessibility.

- Avoid using color as the sole method of conveying information.

- Apply accessibility principles consistently from design through testing.

- Apply high-contrast modes to enhance accessibility for users with visual impairments.

- Use both automated and manual tools to test and verify color contrast accessibility.

- Accessible design improves usability for all users, fostering inclusivity.

This module was developed in collaboration with [Teach Access](https://teachaccess.org/), a non-profit 501(c)(3) organization collaborating with education, industry, government, and disability advocacy organizations to address the critical need to enhance students’ understanding of digital accessibility as they learn to design, develop, and build new technologies with the needs of people with disabilities in mind.
