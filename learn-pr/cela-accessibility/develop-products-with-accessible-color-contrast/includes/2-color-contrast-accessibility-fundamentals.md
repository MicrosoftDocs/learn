## Key terms and concepts 

Familiarizing yourself with key terms is essential for effective color and contrast. Let's define and explain some of the most important terms:

- **Contrast ratio**: This is a measurement of the difference in luminance between two colors. The Web Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) define minimum contrast ratios for text and images of text to ensure readability. For example, normal text has a required minimum contrast ratio of **4.5:1**, which means the foreground color is 4.5 times brighter than the background color. Nontext and Large-scale text (larger fonts) needs a contrast ratio of at least **3:1**.

- **Image of text**: This refers to the text presented within an image. According to WCAG, images of text should be avoided unless the text can't be presented in any other way, such as a logo. This is because images of text don't scale or change colors and text, potentially leading to accessibility issues.
  
  **Decorative Elements**: Decorative elements don't convey any information and aren't used for interaction. For accessibility purposes, these elements don't need to meet contrast requirements, as they don't impact the [user's understanding of content or navigation](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/non-text-contrast.html#:~:text=would%20still%20conform.-,Required%20for%20Understanding,-The%20term%20%22required).

- **Windows Contrast Themes**: Windows contrast themes refer to the theme settings that use color combinations where text and important UI elements are presented with a significant difference in color and brightness from their background. Strongly contrasting colors can make it quicker and easier to read for people with low vision from your PC. Users can select respective themes by select Start button -> Settings -> Accessibility -> Contrast themes.

## Importance of color and contrast

Color and contrast are critical in designing digital products, as they greatly influence the readability and usability of content. Effective use of color and contrast ensures that text and other elements are easily distinguishable. This is important for users with visual impairments, such as low visual acuity, color deficiencies, and low contrast sensitivity, and for users interacting with a screen in a brightly lit environment. High-contrast color schemes between text and background enhance the user's ability to differentiate between text, buttons, and interactive elements. This helps prevent eye strain and improves accessibility for all users, especially in low-light environments or on smaller screens.

Moreover, color and contrast are essential for crafting an inclusive user experience in digital products. By following accessibility standards like the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), designers and developers can ensure their products are accessible to a wider audience. This not only aids in meeting legal requirements but also reflects a strong commitment to diversity and inclusion.

In addition to improving accessibility, the effective use of color and contrast can enhance the overall aesthetic appeal and user engagement of digital products. Thoughtful color choices can evoke emotions, reinforce brand identity, and direct users' attention to important elements. High-contrast colors can emphasize key information and call-to-action buttons, making navigation and interaction with the content more intuitive. By prioritizing color and contrast in design, designers can ensure their digital products aren't only functional and accessible but also visually appealing and engaging.
