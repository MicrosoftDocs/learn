During the design phase, it is essential to prioritize accessibility from the outset. Key considerations include ensuring adequate contrast ratios, avoiding the use of color as the sole method of conveying information, designing with high-contrast modes for users with visual impairments, and testing for accessibility throughout the development process with both automated and manual tools.

## Use of color

Here are some techniques to make sure your design is perceivable and distinguishable. If you use color to convey information through specific words, backgrounds, or other content:

- Make sure any information presented in color is also available in the text.

- Add a text cue to form control labels that use color.

- Provide additional visual cues when using text color to convey information, such as patterns or textures.

- Use a contrast ratio of **3:1** with surrounding text and add extra visual cues on hover for links or controls identified by color alone.

In the example, green is used to indicate something good, and red is used to indicate something bad—a common way to use colors. However, the design includes symbols to communicate “good” and “bad” and text to explain the information. Therefore, this design doesn't rely solely on color to convey important information. Using color to convey information is effective as long as it is not the only method used.

The tool also notes that no content add-ins were found." lightbox="../media/color-contrast-design-use-color.png":::

If you use color within an image to convey information, such as different values or required form fields:

- Include patterns to show the same information.

- Convey information in text. 

In this example of a transportation map, each route is presented using a different color, and each stop is marked with a unique icon or shape. 

:::image type="content" source="../media/color-contrast-transportation-map.png" alt-text="Screenshot of a transportation map illustrating three distinct routes, each defined by a specific color and shape: Route A is represented by the color blue and circles, Route B by the color green and squares, and Route C by the color red and triangles." lightbox="../media/color-contrast-transportation-map.png":::

Finally, use color combinations that are easily distinguishable for users with color vision deficiencies.

## Contrast

The goal is to ensure readers can read text that is presented over a background. Here are some techniques to make sure your design has enough contrast: 

- Ensure that the contrast ratio between the text or image of text and their background is **at least 4.5:1** if the text is **less than** 18-point and unbolded, or less than 14-point and bolded. 

- Ensure that the contrast ratio between the text or image of text and the background is **at least 3:1** if the text is **at least** 18-point and unbolded, or at least 14-point and bolded.

For example, in a website that uses a patterned background image, the designer should add a semi-transparent dark overlay behind the text to achieve a contrast ratio of **4.5:1**. 

To ensure good contrast, pair dark colors with light colors. Some medium colors can be paired with both dark and light colors. Very few colors in the palette are in high-contrast mode, so other styling will need to be used to differentiate various control states. You can:

- Let the user's browser or device settings determine the color of the text and the background by not specifying them in your design.

- As an alternative, allow users to switch to a version of the page with enough contrast to be easily readable. This high-contrast version should have all the information and functionality as the original page but with better readability.

Controls with low contrast are harder to see and might be missed by people with visual disabilities. Therefore, any visual information needed to identify a control or understand a graphic must meet the minimum contrast ratio. For active user interface elements (like buttons and links) and important graphics, make sure the contrast ratio is **at least 3:1** against adjacent colors for these elements. Keep in mind that visual indicators such as checkboxes or menu arrows should have enough contrast to be easily visible. As a recommendation, outline the boundaries of controls to help people with cognitive disabilities recognize them more easily.
