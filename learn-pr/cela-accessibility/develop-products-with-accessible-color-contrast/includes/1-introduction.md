In this module, you focus on color and contrast within accessibility. Color and contrast play a vital role in accessible design by ensuring that content is perceivable by all users, including those with visual impairments. It's essential to consider how color choices and contrast levels can impact the usability of websites and applications, particularly for users with visual impairments, color blindness, or other disabilities. In this unit, you explore the importance of color and contrast and delve into key concepts such as contrast ratio, image of text, large scale, pure decoration, and high contrast, all within the framework of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG).
