Personalizing learning is about adjusting instruction and tools so students can access materials and participate in ways that reflect their individual strengths and needs. For students with disabilities, this often includes thoughtful use of assistive technology alongside instructional decisions made by educators and the broader special education team.

This module explores how optional Microsoft tools, including Teach in Microsoft 365 Copilot, Immersive Reader, Reading Progress, Math Assistant, PowerPoint Accessibility Checker, Dictation, and Live Captions, can support personalization when they align with instructional goals and student needs. Used with professional judgment, these tools can help streamline preparation, increase accessibility, and expand options for engagement without replacing the expertise and decision‑making of educators.
