When presentations include clear structure, alt text, accessible reading order, and captions, more students can engage effectively.

Imagine you're preparing an ecosystem presentation with images and a short video clip.

### Start with Copilot in PowerPoint
- Open PowerPoint and use Copilot to draft an outline and generate slides with concise, plain‑language bullet points.

### Run Accessibility Assistant
- Check for accessibility issues.  
- Fix reading order.  
- Replace embedded text with real text.  
- Add meaningful alt text (e.g., “Food web diagram: arrows show energy flow…”).

### Enable captions
- Turn on **PowerPoint Live captions** or present in Teams with live captions.

### Add speaker notes
Include important terms and definitions so students may preview them.

### Prepare accessible recordings and handouts
- Publish recordings with captions.  
- Provide accessible handouts using real text instead of images.
