Personalizing learning ensures every student can access content and participate fully. This includes adapting text with Copilot and Immersive Reader, using Reading Progress with differentiated passages, making math accessible with Math Assistant and Copilot, and ensuring presentations are accessible with PowerPoint features like live captions and alt text. By integrating these tools, educators reduce cognitive load, increase engagement, and meet a range of accessibility needs.
