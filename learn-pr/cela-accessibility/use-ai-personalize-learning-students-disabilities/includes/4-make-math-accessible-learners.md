Math can be particularly challenging for students with dyscalculia or low vision. Providing step‑by‑step solutions and visual aids helps build understanding and confidence. Microsoft tools like **Math Assistant in OneNote** and **Copilot** help generate annotated steps, diagrams, and audio explanations.

Imagine you’re teaching fraction addition with unlike denominators to a student with dyscalculia and a student with low vision.

### Set up in OneNote
1. Open OneNote and create a new page.  
2. Type or handwrite fraction problems (e.g., `2/3 + 1/4` and `5/6 + 3/8`).  
3. If handwriting, use **Ink to Math** for recognition.  
4. Ensure **Math Assistant** is enabled.

### Use Math Assistant to show steps
1. Select the first problem.  
2. Go to **Draw > Math** (or **Insert > Math**).  
3. In the Math pane, choose **Show steps** and select the action (e.g., *Add fractions*).  

Steps shown may include:
- Find common denominator  
- Convert  
- Add  
- Simplify  

### Make steps clear with Copilot
1. Copy the steps from Math Assistant.  
2. Prompt Copilot:  
   **“Rewrite these steps in plain language and add a short note explaining why each step matters.”**  
3. Paste revised steps back into OneNote.

### Add accessibility features
- Increase line spacing  
- Switch to high‑contrast page color  
- Use large fonts  
- Insert simple fraction diagrams (bars or circles)  
- Add alt text  
- Activate **Read Aloud** via Immersive Reader  

### Provide scaffolded independent practice
Ask Copilot to generate three practice problems with:
- Visual cues (icons for “convert,” “add,” “simplify”)  
- A self‑check rubric  

Insert these into OneNote for students to complete.
