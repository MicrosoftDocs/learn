Some students may benefit from structured reading practice and timely feedback. Reading Progress in Microsoft Teams enables teachers to assign passages, track fluency, and analyze progress automatically. Combined with Copilot, educators can quickly generate differentiated passages and comprehension questions tailored to individual student needs.

Imagine you’re supporting a student with dyslexia who struggles to decode multisyllabic words. In Microsoft Teams, create a Reading Progress assignment with a short, decodable passage.

To personalize the experience, use Copilot in Microsoft 365 to generate three versions:

- One at the student’s current level  
- One slightly easier for confidence building  
- One slightly more challenging for growth

Include two comprehension checks aligned to your objectives (e.g., decoding accuracy and expression). During the reading session, enable Immersive Reader for syllable breaks and Read Aloud to model fluent reading. Ask the student to record at least one attempt without audio support to measure independent fluency.

### Steps for text differentiation using Copilot
1. Open Microsoft 365 Copilot (in Word or Teams Chat).  
2. Paste or type your original passage into Copilot.  
3. Use this prompt:  
   **“Create three versions of this passage: one at the current reading level, one slightly easier for confidence building, and one slightly more challenging for growth. Add two comprehension questions focused on decoding accuracy and expression.”**



4. Review the generated versions for accuracy.  
5. Copy each version into separate Reading Progress assignments—or combine into one assignment with multiple options.  
6. Add comprehension questions to each assignment.  
7. After submission, review Insights for WPM, accuracy, and miscues.  
8. Use this data to adjust future assignments while following FERPA‑aligned practices.
