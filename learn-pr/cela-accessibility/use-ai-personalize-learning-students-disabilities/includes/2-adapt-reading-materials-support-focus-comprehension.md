Students with ADHD, dyslexia, and other learning disabilities often struggle with dense text, which can lead to frustration and disengagement. Personalizing structure and adding auditory support reduces cognitive load and improves comprehension. Copilot can help teachers transform complex text into accessible formats and Immersive Reader can support students by enabling line focus, adjusting spacing, and generating summaries with guiding questions.

Imagine you’re preparing a science article on ecosystems for a student with ADHD and dyslexia. Dense text can feel overwhelming, so you decide to personalize the structure and add auditory support.

1. Open the article in Microsoft Edge
    - Launch Microsoft Edge and navigate to the science article or passage you want to use.

2. Use Copilot to simplify and scaffold content
    - Open the Copilot sidebar in Edge.  
    - Enter this prompt:  
    **“Summarize this article in plain language and create three guiding comprehension questions aligned with [insert lesson objectives].”**

    - Copilot will generate a simplified summary and questions to help students focus on key ideas.

3. Create an accessible version in Word
    - Copy the summary and questions from Copilot.  
    - Open **Microsoft Word** and paste them into a new document. Then save the document.  
    - This gives students a structured, easy‑to‑read version of the content.

4. Activate Immersive Reader in Word for accessibility
    - Go to the **View** tab and select **Immersive Reader**.  
    - Turn on **Line Focus** to highlight one line at a time.  
    - Adjust **text spacing** and choose a calming page theme to reduce distractions.  
    - Enable **Read Aloud** so students can listen while following along visually, reinforcing comprehension through multiple channels.

5. Encourage engagement
Ask students to respond to the guiding questions generated by Copilot. This helps them connect ideas and demonstrate understanding without feeling overwhelmed by the original dense text.

> [!TIP]
> If students are struggling with typing, encourage them to use [Dictation in Microsoft Word](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/dictate-your-documents-in-word-3876e05f-3fcc-418f-b8ab-db7ce0d11d3c). This feature lets them speak their ideas and will convert their speech into text.
