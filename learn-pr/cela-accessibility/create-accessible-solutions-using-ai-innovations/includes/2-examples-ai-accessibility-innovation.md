It's essential that we build a future where people of all abilities benefit from technology. People with disabilities have a fundamental right to access technology. Breakthroughs such as generative AI, when done in an accessible way, can be a game changer for people with disabilities.

Two examples of how AI can remove barriers and help people with disabilities be their best selves are:

- **Energy management**: The spoon theory explains thatâ€¯people living with chronic illness, chronic pain, and disability have limited energy resources. They also expend more energy on everyday tasks than people without illness and disability. With a virtual assistant to support design and other tasks, AI gives these individuals some of their time back and helps them experience the joy of barrier-free creativity.  
- **Discoverability**: Another barrier to equal access to technology is a lack of discoverability. Discoverability is the degree to which something, especially a piece of content or information, can be found in a search of a file, database, or other information system. Technology can become so feature-rich that many people might not know what's available or what they can do with a technology solution.  

The following video explains how an individual with disabilities uses [Microsoft Copilot](https://copilot.microsoft.com/) as an "everyday AI companion" to enhance productivity, creativity, energy management, and discoverability.
