Math can be particularly challenging for students with dyscalculia or vision disabilities. Providing step-by-step solutions and visual aids helps build understanding and confidence. Microsoft tools like **Math Assistant in OneNote** and **Copilot** make this possible by generating annotated steps, diagrams, and even audio explanations—ensuring students receive clear, accessible support for complex problems.

Imagine you are teaching fraction addition with unlike denominators to a student with dyscalculia who benefits from explicit, visual scaffolds and to a student with low vision who needs high-contrast materials. Here's how to make the lesson accessible and effective:

1. Set up in OneNote
   1. Open OneNote and create a new page for the lesson.
   2. Type or handwrite the fraction problems (e.g., 2/3 + 1/4 and 5/6 + 3/8)

   > [!TIP]
   > If handwriting, use Ink to Math to convert to digital text for Math Assistant recognition.

   3. Ensure Math Assistant is enabled under Settings > Options if you are using it for the first time.

2. Use Math Assistant to show steps
    1. Select the first problem.
    2. Go to Draw > Math (or Insert > Math depending on your version).
    3. In the Math pane, choose Show steps and select the action (e.g., Add fractions).
    4. Review the generated steps:
     - Find common denominator → Convert → Add → Simplify.
3. Make steps clear with Copilot
    1. Copy the steps from Math Assistant. 
    2. Open Copilot (in Word or Teams Chat) and prompt: "Rewrite these steps in plain language and add a short note explaining why each step matters."<br>Example: 
    - Finding a common denominator makes fractions comparable.
    3. Paste the revised steps back into OneNote for student reference.
4. Add accessibility features
    1. In OneNote:
        1. Increase line spacing for readability.
        2. Switch to a high-contrast page color.
        3. Use large font labels for each step.
        4. Insert a simple diagram (bars or circles) showing fraction conversion.
   2.  Add alt-text to diagrams for screen readers.
   3. Turn on Read Aloud (View > Immersive Reader) so students can listen to explanations.
5. Provide scaffolded independent practice
    1. Ask Copilot to generate three practice problems with:
        1. Visual cues (icons for "convert," "add," "simplify") paired with text labels.
        2. A short self-check rubric (e.g., Did I find the common denominator?).
   2. Insert these problems into OneNote for students to complete.
