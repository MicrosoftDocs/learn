Personalizing learning helps students with disabilities access content in ways that align with their strengths, needs, and instructional goals. With professional judgment guiding every decision, educators may choose to use Microsoft tools to adapt reading materials, support fluency and comprehension, clarify math reasoning, and reduce barriers related to language, format, or presentation. Copilot, Immersive Reader, Reading Progress, Math Assistant, and PowerPoint accessibility features can streamline preparation, create multiple access points, and support engagement without replacing instructional intent.

Responsible use remains essential. Educators review and refine AI‑supported content to ensure accuracy, accessibility, privacy, and alignment with IEP goals, FERPA and IDEA requirements, and student needs. Guided by Microsoft Responsible AI principles, special education teams decide which tools, if any, best support learning while maintaining trust, compliance, and educator expertise.
