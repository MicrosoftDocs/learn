Think about a recent lesson or activity from your own practice. Consider how small, intentional adjustments might reduce barriers for one or more students with disabilities, using tools in ways that align with instructional goals and professional judgment.

Use the following prompts to guide your reflection:

1. **Identify a barrier:** What specific challenge affected student access or engagement? For example, dense text, reading fluency demands, math complexity, or visuals without adequate descriptions.
1. **Select a supportive option:** Which Microsoft tool introduced in this module could help address that barrier, if appropriate? Consider why this approach might fit the students' needs, your instructional intent, and the context of the lesson.
1. **Plan a next step:** How might you try this approach in a future lesson or activity? Identify one concrete action, such as enabling Immersive Reader, running the Accessibility Assistant, or using Reading Progress to adjust reading support.
1. **Reflect on impact:** How would you determine whether the adjustment was helpful? Think about what indicators you might look for, including student feedback, engagement, comprehension checks, or observational notes.
