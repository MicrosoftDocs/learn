Families need clear, understandable information to support their child’s learning. Technical documents like IEPs and progress reports often contain jargon that can confuse multilingual families, creating barriers to engagement.

One way to remove these barriers is to use Copilot to rewrite content in plain language and then use Microsoft Translator to translate documents into the family’s preferred language. This combination ensures accuracy and cultural responsiveness while saving time.

Educators should create both an English version and a translated version of IEP goals:
1. Open the document in Microsoft Word.  
2. Use Copilot to rewrite the IEP goal in plain language.  
3. Go to **Review → Language → Translate** to translate the text into the family’s preferred language.  
4. Add a note indicating the translation was generated using AI tools.  
5. Save and share securely.

This ensures the message is clear, culturally appropriate, and easy for families to act on.
