Not all families can attend live meetings due to work schedules, caregiving responsibilities, or accessibility needs.  
Providing asynchronous options ensures communication remains inclusive and respectful of families’ time.

AI tools help educators share information in multiple formats.

For example:
- After a meeting, a teacher can record the session, enable transcription, and translate the transcript into the family’s preferred language.
- Copilot can generate a plain‑language summary and an email with next steps and links to resources.

Scenario example: A parent who works night shifts misses a meeting. The teacher records the meeting, transcribes it, translates it into Spanish, drafts a clear summary email with an accessible PDF, and includes a captioned video recap.
