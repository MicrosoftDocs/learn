Real‑time conversations can exclude families who speak different languages or parents with disabilities, leading to misunderstandings and disengagement. Inclusive meetings promote collaboration and confidence.

Teachers can guide families to turn on Live Captions in Microsoft Teams.

> [!TIP]
> You can use Live Captions in Teams for both in‑person and virtual meetings.

### Steps for Families During a Meeting

1. Select **More actions → Language and speech → Show live captions**.
2. Confirm the spoken language.
3. If Teams Premium is available, select **Translate to** and choose a preferred language.
4. Adjust caption style (font size, color, position) via **Caption settings**.

### Meeting Transcripts

- Captions are not saved automatically.  
- Teachers should enable transcription during the meeting for a written record.  
- If district privacy policies allow, the meeting can be recorded and translated afterward.

### Accessibility Features for Parents with Disabilities

Educators should offer:
- Accessible transcripts
- High‑contrast caption settings  
- Plain‑language directions  
- Alternative formats (audio summaries, accessible documents)

These steps ensure all families can fully engage with meeting content.

### Follow‑Up Communication

Use Copilot in Outlook or Word to write friendly follow‑up emails or messages summarizing key points in multiple languages and accessible formats.
