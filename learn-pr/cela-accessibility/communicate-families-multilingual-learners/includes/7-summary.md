Effective communication with families—especially multilingual families and those with disabilities—is essential for building trust and supporting student success.

Educators learn to:

- Translate and simplify IEPs and progress reports using Microsoft Translator and Copilot.  
- Enable Live Captions, provide transcripts, and create accessible follow‑up communication.  
- Offer flexible engagement through asynchronous summaries, translated notes, and culturally responsive outreach.

By combining translation, plain language, and accessibility practices, educators create inclusive communication strategies that respect families’ time, language, and cultural context.
