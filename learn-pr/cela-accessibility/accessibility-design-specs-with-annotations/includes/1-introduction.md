Accessibility annotations are labels or comments included in designs for digital products to outline how elements should be made accessible. They offer direction to developers, designers, and testers to help ensure content is usable by individuals with disabilities. These annotations typically explain how components should function with assistive technologies like screen readers, keyboards, and magnifiers. Many accessibility problems can be anticipated and avoided during the design phase. Use practical tips and a curated list of tools, plugins, and templates to save time documenting accessibility in your mockups with tools like Figma.
