    - content: "To read the text of a player's typed message aloud to other players in the voice channel via synthesized audio."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Text to speech chat refers to the text a player enters into a form field, which is then read aloud to other players in the chat voice channel."
    - content: "To transcribe what other players have said aloud in the voice channel into text that players can read onscreen in real time."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This option describes the speech to text chat tool."
  - content: "What approach can developers take if their game isn't compatible with third-party or platform-provided assistive technologies?"
    choices:
    - content: "Assume third-party or platform developers will eventually create assistive technologies that will seamlessly work with all game titles."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. During this period of waiting, many players can be excluded from a game title. Providing these tools at the game level can ultimately result in more accessible experiences overall for the player."
    - content: "Put an advisory about a lack of assistive technology compatibility in the game's store description."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. It's important to provide customers with documentation about your product's accessibility status prior to their purchase. This approach doesn't actively support assistive technology users in playing your game."
    - content: "Provide in-game assistive technologies for players such as screen narration, magnification tools, and contrast settings."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. This would be the best approach to support players who use assistive technology for scenarios where platform or third-party assistive technology isn't compatible, and in general."
