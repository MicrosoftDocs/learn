In this module, you’ve learned about best practices for developing more accessible gaming hardware experiences and packaging components. Here is a summary of what we covered:

- Providing standard connection options like USB or Bluetooth on devices can help ensure that players can connect their assistive devices to supporting hardware products.
- Considering adjustments to button size, height, and activation force can increase the accessibility of standard hardware devices.
- Representing important device status information through multiple sensory channels including vision, audio, and tactile to ensure more players can use this inform to inform successful interactions.
- Implement accessible packaging components like tactile cues that inform proper device orientation, pull tabs to remove adhesive, and multiple options for device and component removal.
