  questions:
  - content: "Which of the following options best describes the concept of customization in the context of game accessibility?"
    choices:
    - content: "Players should be able to customize the visual aspects of their UI."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Visual UI customization is one of the many areas where customization options should be provided, but UI customization alone doesn't represent the best description of customization in the context of game accessibility."
    - content: "Players should be able to customize the overall game difficulty."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Game difficulty customization is one of the many areas where customization options should be provided. However, providing customization for game difficulty alone doesn't represent the best description of customization in the context of game accessibility."
    - content: "Players should be able to customize as many aspects of their experience as possible to meet their specific accessibility needs and preferences."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. As a foundational accessibility concept, customization of experiences should be broadly applied to as many game areas as possible to support players by creating truly accessible experiences."
  - content: "Which of the following customization options would best support the player in the following scenario? A player repeatedly fails the game level they're currently on. Enemy characters appear to blend into the game's background, which allows them to inflict damage before the player is aware of their presence."
    choices:
    - content: "The developer can give players the option to eliminate enemy encounters altogether."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Although an option like this should be provided to players in general, in this scenario it doesn't appropriately address the player's customization needs. The player's primary barrier is their inability to see enemy characters that are present. Eliminating enemies altogether changes the nature of the game experience without addressing the source of this player's issue."
    - content: "The developer can give players the option to customize the visual appearance of enemies, for example, by adding brightly colored outlines in a color that the player chooses."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. This option allows players to enhance the visibility of enemies in a way that works best for them. This option addresses the source of the player's issue (via visual customization) without completely eliminating enemy character battles."
    - content: "The developer can provide the option to reduce the damage that enemies inflict in combat."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Although an option like this one should also be included in the game, this customization approach doesn't address this player's needs. Although enemy damage is decreased, this option doesn't allow the player to customize their UI to ensure that enemies are more visually apparent to the player."
