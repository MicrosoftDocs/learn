In this module, you learned about foundational accessibility best practice principles for games and platforms. You were also introduced to the Xbox Accessibility Guidelines (XAGs) as a comprehensive resource to guide accessible game development.

Let's recap some of the key learnings presented:

- A general understanding of foundational accessibility concepts that can be broadly applied to game development is an important first step in making best practice implementation more approachable for developers.
- These foundational concepts include the notion of customization, representation through multiple channels, and multiple ways of task completion.
- The Xbox Accessibility Guidelines can be used as a reference for targeted guidance on specific game areas. Each XAG topic provides:
  - A detailed description of the players affected.
  - Which individual game areas to apply best practices.
  - Implementation guidelines.
  - Other resources and tools to promote clarity and comprehension.
