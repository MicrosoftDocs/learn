You're now familiar with some of the foundational accessibility best practice concepts that can be broadly applied across gaming experiences. At this point, you likely need more detailed guidance.

For example, you know that the best practice principle of "customization" means providing players with options to adjust the size and color of text. You might have questions about the extent of size and color options you should provide in the context of your specific game. Detailed resources on accessibility best practices like the Xbox Accessibility Guidelines (XAGs) can be a valuable tool.

This unit provides an overview of the content within the XAGs. It also has general instructions on how to navigate this resource to find guidance related to the products and experiences you create.

## What are the Xbox Accessibility Guidelines?

The [Xbox Accessibility Guidelines](https://aka.ms/xags) are a set of game accessibility best practices that have been developed in partnership with industry experts and members of the Gaming & Disability Community. Microsoft initially released the XAGs in January 2020.

The XAGs are intended for the following audiences and use cases:

- For designers to use as a catalyst for generating ideas
- For developers to use as guardrails when they develop their games
- For test teams to use as a checklist to validate the accessibility of their titles

> [!NOTE]
> The XAGs aren't intended to function as a checklist to validate any type of compliance or legal requirements. Instead, they seek to ensure that the user experience in a game offers a base level of accessible support that makes games enjoyable and playable for as many players as possible.

The guidelines are separated into 23 individual sections that focus on specific aspects of inclusive game design. These sections include best practices for the following topics:
