      isCorrect: true

    choices:
    - content: "Implementation guidelines"

    - content: "Gamer personas"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The Gamer personas section can help developers understand the general population of players that specific XAG guidance applies to. However, it isn't helpful in determining whether a particular XAG is applicable to the developer's scope of work."
