Familiarizing yourself with key terms is essential for effectively implementing resize and reflow. Let's define and explain some of the most important terms:

- **Resize**: This term refers to changing the size of elements on a screen, which may include increasing or decreasing the size of text, images, and other content to enhance readability and accessibility. Resize is particularly important for users with visual impairments, as they often require larger text or elements to interact with content effectively.
- **Reflow**: This is the process of rearranging content to fit the screen size and orientation. During reflow, the layout adjusts dynamically to maintain readability and usability, eliminating the need for horizontal scrolling. This is especially crucial for mobile devices and ensures users can access content comfortably in one direction. Except for parts of the content which require two-dimensional layout for usage or meaning. Examples of content which requires two-dimensional layout are images required for understanding (such as maps and diagrams), video, games, presentations, data tables (not individual cells), and interfaces where it's necessary to keep toolbars in view while manipulating content.

## Importance of Supporting Resize and Reflow

When using apps on a computer or mobile device, content is often presented visually, which may be too small for users with low vision to read. Enlarging the content improves readability but can lead to two-dimensional scrolling (both horizontally and vertically), which is inefficient. Supporting both resize and reflow is crucial for accessibility, particularly for users with low vision. Resize allows users to enlarge content, making it easier to read, while reflow adjusts the layout so that content fits the screen without requiring horizontal scrolling. This enhances usability by enabling users to navigate and interact with the app efficiently, without disorientation or the need to pan in multiple directions. By incorporating both features, apps become more inclusive, allowing users of all abilities to access and engage with content comfortably across various devices and screen sizes.

## Assistive Technologies for Users With Low Vision

In this section we will focus on some assistive technologies for people with low vision.

- **Screen magnifiers**: Tools such as Windows Magnifier and the Zoom feature on Apple devices enlarge everything on the user's screen, allowing for clearer visibility. Individuals can zoom in to read text or examine images without experiencing discomfort.
- **Screen readers**: Software such as JAWS, NVDA, and VoiceOver vocalizes the text displayed on the screen. These programs assist individuals with low vision by describing the on-screen content and guiding them through websites or applications using audio cues.
- **Text-to-speech (TTS) software**: This technology converts written text into spoken words. Instead of reading the text on their own, users can listen to it being read aloud, which can enhance comprehension.
- **High-contrast modes**: These settings enhance the contrast between text and background colors, often employing dark backgrounds with bright text, which makes the text easier to see and read.
- **Braille displays**: These specialized devices convert text displayed on a screen into refreshable Braille that can be felt with the fingers, enabling individuals who are blind or have very low vision to read by touch.
- **Customizable keyboard shortcuts**: These shortcuts allow users to perform tasks such as opening applications or navigating through documents using the keyboard instead of a mouse, making it quicker and easier for those who struggle to see the mouse pointer.
- **Color filters**: These tools modify the colors on the screen to assist individuals who have difficulty distinguishing certain colors, such as those who are color-blind. For instance, the filter may transform everything into shades of gray or enhance colors that are hard to differentiate.
