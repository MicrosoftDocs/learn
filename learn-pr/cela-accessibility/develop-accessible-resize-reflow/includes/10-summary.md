In this module, you delved into accessibility considerations for resize and reflow throughout the product development cycle, underscoring the importance of embedding accessibility principles from the initial design phase through to final implementation and testing. Key topics covered included designing with responsive web principles, implementing scalable elements, ensuring visible focus indicators and text insertion points, leveraging accessibility APIs, and conducting comprehensive testing across multiple devices and with assistive technologies, as outlined by WCAG. By integrating these considerations, you can ensure that your digital products are accessible to all users, enhancing both usability and inclusivity.

Make sure to gather all applicable notes, save any resources you want to reference and reflect on what was learned about this topic.

- Use flexible grids, fluid images, and media queries to ensure content adapts to different screen sizes and orientations.
- Utilize relative units like **ems** and **rems** for font sizes and include the viewport meta tag to control layout on mobile browsers.
- Ensure focus indicators are high contrast and consistently styled to help users navigate content using keyboards or assistive technologies.
- Expose focus, text insertion points, and selections to make content navigable and interactive for all users.
- Test content on various devices with screen readers and conduct user testing with individuals with disabilities to ensure accessibility.

This module was developed in collaboration with [Teach Access](https://teachaccess.org/), a non-profit 501(c)(3) organization collaborating with education, industry, government, and disability advocacy organizations to address the critical need to enhance students' understanding of digital accessibility as they learn to design, develop, and build new technologies with the needs of people with disabilities in mind.
