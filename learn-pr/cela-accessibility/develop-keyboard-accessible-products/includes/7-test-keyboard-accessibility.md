## Manual testing

Here are some ways to manually test your website or app for keyboard accessibility. While using only the keyboard:
- Navigate your website or app, avoiding the mouse or touch inputs.
- Ensure you can reach and move away from every interactive element.
- Ensure you can perform actions on every interactive element. 
- Confirm that the order of controls is logical and intuitive.
- Make sure the navigation follows common keyboard conventions like **F6**/**Shift** + **F6**, **Tab**/**Shift** + **Tab**, **Arrow** **keys**, **Enter**, **Space**, **Esc**, and **Shift** + **F10**.
- Ensure that keyboard strokes follow standard shortcut conventions. 
- Check if the app's UX or documentation provides necessary keyboard shortcuts.
- Ensure the keyboard focus is clearly visible with sufficient contrast in both normal mode and Windows High-Contrast mode.
- Test thoroughly to ensure there are no keyboard traps.
- Verify that the focus does not change unexpectedly, even when the focused element disappears or becomes disabled.

Testing your website or app for keyboard accessibility on Mac: 
- Test with the Keyboard Navigation setting on (In System Preferences, go to Keyboard > Shortcuts and enable "Use keyboard navigation to move focus between controls.")
- When the focus is in a text edit control, use **Control** + **Tab** to move focus to the next control instead of inserting a tab character. 
- In Safari, with the default settings enabled, use **Option** + **Tab** to include links in the tab order. Alternatively, go to Preferences > General > Accessibility and enable "Press **Tab** to highlight each item on a webpage." This will ensure that links are included in the tab order when you press **Tab**.

## User testing

User testing for keyboard accessibility is crucial to ensure that websites and applications are usable by everyone, including people with disabilities. This type of testing helps identify and address barriers that might prevent users who rely on keyboards or assistive technologies from fully interacting with digital products. By involving people with disabilities in the testing process, developers can gain valuable insights into real-world challenges and ensure that the user experience is inclusive and accessible.
