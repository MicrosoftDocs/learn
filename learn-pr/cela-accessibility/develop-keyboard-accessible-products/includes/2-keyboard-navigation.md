## Importance of keyboard accessibility

Keyboard accessibility is crucial for creating inclusive digital experiences that accommodate a wide range of users. It allows individuals who cannot use a mouse effectively to navigate and utilize websites and applications. While graphical user interfaces have made computing more intuitive for users who can see and control a mouse, they can be challenging for those with limited mobility or visual impairments. Many of these users can operate a keyboard, enabling them to interact with technology and complete tasks independently. By supporting keyboard navigation, we enhance the user experience for people with disabilities and also cater to users who prefer keyboard navigation for its efficiency and speed.

Keyboard accessibility greatly enhances the user experience by enabling smoother navigation, better focus management, clear visual indicators, and making digital products more seamless and enjoyable. Additionally, there are important legal and ethical considerations. Many countries/regions have regulations that require digital products to be accessible. Ensuring keyboard accessibility helps organizations comply with these laws, avoid legal issues, and show a commitment to inclusivity. By prioritizing keyboard accessibility, you ensure a wider range of people can use your websites and applications.

## Key terms and concepts

Familiarizing yourself with key terms is essential for effective keyboard accessibility. Let's define and explain some of the most important terms: 

- **Keyboard Navigation:** Users can move around and use a computer or digital content by pressing keys on the keyboard instead of using a mouse. This method is especially useful for people who find it difficult to use a mouse or prefer using the keyboard for quicker access. 

- **Keyboard Navigation Conventions:** These standard rules and practices allow users to move around and interact with digital content using a keyboard. These practices include using keys like **Tab** to switch between items, **Enter** to select them, and **arrow keys** to move up, down, left, or right. Keyboard navigation conventions ensure a consistent and predictable user experience, making it easier for everyone to navigate websites, apps, and other digital tools using a keyboard.

- **Accelerator Keys:** These keyboard shortcuts allow users to quickly perform common tasks without using a mouse. For example, pressing **Ctrl** + **C** copies text, and **Ctrl** + **V** pastes it. These shortcuts help users work more efficiently by saving time. 

- **Navigation Traps:** Users can get stuck while trying to move around a website or app using a keyboard, meaning they can't navigate to other parts of the page or app. The only way to escape is to reload the page or restart the app. These traps make it difficult and sometimes impossible for users to navigate and use the content effectively. 


## Keyboard navigation conventions

Keyboard navigation conventions ensure that users can efficiently and effectively navigate through websites, apps, and content using a keyboard. One of the most fundamental conventions is the use of the **Tab** key to move focus sequentially through interactive elements such as links, buttons, and form fields. 
- The **Shift** +** Tab** combination allows users to move focus in the reverse order. This predictable and consistent navigation pattern helps users understand the structure of the content and locate the elements they need to interact with.
- In addition to the **Tab** key, several other keys enhance navigation and usability. For example: 
- The **Enter** key is used to activate buttons, open links, or open menus.
- The **Spacebar** key is used to activate buttons, select or deselect checkboxes, scroll down the page, or open a dropdown menu.
- On the web, to scroll pages, the **Arrow** **keys** are used to navigate within menus, dropdowns, and other list-based elements.
- The **Escape** key is used to dismiss dialogs and task panes. 

Common UI components like radio groups, tab lists, menus, and grids have several parts you can focus on. For example, a radio group has multiple radio buttons you can select. Only one radio button is part of the tab order. When you press the **Tab** key, it moves focus to a radio button in the group. You can then use the **Arrow** **keys** to move between the radio buttons. Pressing the **Tab** key again moves focus out of the radio group to the next item.

On the web, the **Home** and **End** keys allow users to quickly move to the beginning or end of a page or document. In apps, specific key combinations may be used to access features or perform actions, such as **Ctrl** + **S** to save a document or **Alt** + **F4** to close a window. 

On Mac computers, you can use keyboard navigation by turning Full Keyboard Access on. To do so:
1.  Go to **System Settings**.
1.  Click on the **Accessibility** sidebar.
1.  Under Motor, click **Keyboard**.
1.  Toggle **Full Keyboard Access** on or off.

When this feature is activated, the item with focus will be highlighted, and users can change the color, contrast, and size of this highlight. Here are some keyboard navigation conventions on Mac:

- Use **Tab** to navigate to the next UI element and **Shift** +** Tab** to the previous element. 
- Select items by pressing the **Spacebar** and navigate within a group using the **Arrow keys**. 
- To navigate to the next item, press **Ctrl** + **Tab**, then **Ctrl** + **Shift** + **Tab** to the previous one. 
- In Mac, use **Cmd (command)** + **Tab**, **Cmd** +** Shift** +** Tab** to switch between applications, and **Cmd** +** ~** between windows of the same application.
- Press **Tab** + **W** to open the window chooser and **Tab** + **A** to open the application chooser.
- To open the Control Center, press **Fn** + **C** and **Fn** + **N** to open the Notification Center.
- To move the pointer to keyboard focus, press **Tab + C**  
- Familiarizing yourself with these conventions and shortcuts can significantly improve the user experience for keyboard users, making navigation more intuitive and efficient.

## Practical examples of keyboard navigation 

To give you a hands-on understanding of how keyboard navigation works, let's dive into a couple of practical examples. These examples will showcase how you can use your keyboard to navigate through web pages and apps. There are seven (7) important things to know when using a keyboard:

> [!IMPORTANT]
> 1. **Spacebar** is used to:
>    1. Activate buttons
>    1. Select or deselect checkboxes 
>    1. Open a dropdown menu
 > 1. **Enter** is used to:
 >     1. Activate buttons
 >     1. Open links
 >     1. Open menus
>  1. **Tab or Shift+ tab** moves between controls in forward and backward directions
>  1. **Arrows** keys move inside of controls
>  1. **Esc** dismisses
>  1. Touch devices provide similar swipe functionality depending on the OS/Screen reader.

Please note that some of these are dependent on the user's enabled settings and the OS (operating system) that they are using. Also, controls on Mac and Windows systems are slightly different.  For mac please refer this link to enable full keyboard access: [Navigate your Mac using Full Keyboard Access - Apple Support](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/navigate-your-mac-using-full-keyboard-access-mchlc06d1059/15.0/mac/15.0)

### Exercise 1

Complete these tasks using only your keyboard:
- Create a blank document on Microsoft Word.
- Increase the zoom level using **Cmd (command)** + **plus sign** or **Ctrl** + **plus sign**. 
- Add some text using **=lorem ()**.
- Bold two words using the Ribbon without access keys. 
- Insert any hyperlink using access keys.
- Change the font of some text using the menu dropdown.

### Exercise 2

Complete these tasks using only your keyboard:
- Open a web page of your choice.
- Start at the top of the web page and move through each interactive element on the page.
- Once you've navigated to a button or link, activate it.
- Use the **Arrow Keys** and **Spacebar** to scroll through the page's content.
- If the page has a pop-up or modal, use **Esc** to close it.

Please note that each web page is different and might have varying levels of keyboard accessibility. Also, Mac users will need to enable keyboard navigation in the settings. 

These practical examples demonstrate the importance of keyboard navigation in providing accessible digital experiences. By understanding how keyboard navigation works, you can design and develop user-friendly websites and apps that are inclusive of users with disabilities.
