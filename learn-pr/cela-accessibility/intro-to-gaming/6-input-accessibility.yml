  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "Which of the following options is most likely to introduce barriers related to game input?"
    choices:
    - content: "A game has a large, distracting animation behind the main menu."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A distracting animation behind a menu might introduce a cognitive barrier, not an input barrier."
    - content: "A game has players move their character by holding down a thumb stick in the direction they want to go."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Forcing individuals to hold the stick down in the direction they want to move, might introduce a barrier for players who don't have the physical strength to keep the stick held down for more than a moment."
    - content: "A game requires a player to hold down the right stick button to crouch or enable an option to toggle crouching."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. By providing an option to toggle crouching instead of holding down a button, an input barrier is avoided."
  - content: "Which of the following options is most likely to support a player who has difficulty performing smooth, accurate movements with a thumb stick?"
    choices:
    - content: "An option to turn on an auto-target-lock feature, which only requires the player to move their aiming crosshair relatively close to their target once. After that, their crosshair remains locked to the target until they shoot."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Aiming at moving targets requires precision and accuracy. An option that lessens these demands by locking on to a target after a player is relatively close to it once can support players who have difficulty with these types of tasks."
    - content: "An option to convert button taps to button holds."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. An option like this might assist a player with limited endurance or speed. It wouldn't decrease the precision demands needed to successfully aim at a moving target."
    - content: "An option to turn on autoshoot, so the player's weapon is always firing even when they aren't pressing their fire button."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. An option like this might assist a player with limited endurance who can't hold the sprint button for prolonged periods. This option wouldn't reduce the coordination demands of aiming at a moving target."
