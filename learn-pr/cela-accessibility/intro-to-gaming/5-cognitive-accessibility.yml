    choices:
    - content: "Providing players with an option to enable reminders of which button to use on a jump sequence."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Providing in-game reminders of what game mechanics to use for a particular action eliminates the need for a player to remember all combinations."

      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. This situation places a demand on players to memorize information critical to gameplay. Players who can't recall the information can experience unintentional barriers that block progress."
    - content: "Providing tutorials of new mechanics introduced in gameplay."

      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Learning and cognitive processing applies to problem solving."
    - content: "Attention."
