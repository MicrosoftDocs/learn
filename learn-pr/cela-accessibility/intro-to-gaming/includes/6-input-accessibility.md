The last step in the process of "how games are played" is related to game input. After players have decided on the action they want to take, they generally must provide physical input to their gaming device. In many game scenarios, this physical input must be provided with speed and accuracy over a prolonged period of time to be successful. If a player can't accomplish these tasks, they might be blocked from progressing in a game.

In this unit, learn about common input mechanics in games that might pose barriers for players with mobility-related disabilities.

## Input and gaming

Completing game tasks typically requires players to move their fingers with speed, precision, and coordination as they interact with physical input devices. These experiences can introduce unintentional barriers for players with physical disabilities when:

- Platforms or game titles only support a specific type of input device that some players can't physically use.
- Challenging mechanics like rapidly pressing buttons, pressing multiple buttons at once, or holding buttons down are required actions to progress in game play.
- Players must be able to activate many different inputs to engage in basic play.

In the following video, learn how to identify common input-based elements that can pose unintentional barriers to access for players when proper accessible supports and features aren't provided.

## Mobility and disability

Players with disabilities that affect arm and hand movement can also experience unique barriers to play. The experiences of these players can differ based on the nature of physical demands a game requires for input. You need to be aware of the following factors:

- The speed in which players must activate inputs to be successful
- The dexterity required to perform complex input patterns
- The coordination required to accurately control analog inputs
- The endurance required to engage in game play until a pause, save, or stopping point that saves progress can be reached

Mobility-related disabilities can affect any combination of a player’s strength, dexterity, coordination, and endurance. Some players might be able to activate buttons for prolonged periods with ease but lack coordination to accurately aim at moving targets. Others might experience difficulties related to all four of these categories. The following information discusses the unique barriers and corresponding support approaches to be aware of as you learn more about the gaming accessibility space.

### Strength and gaming

Players must be able to operate the input devices that their platforms and games support. For players with disabilities that affect strength, physical actions like pressing a key on a keyboard, moving a mouse, or holding the weight of a standard controller during play can be difficult.

As a result, these players might avoid the use of standard devices like mice, keyboards, and controllers altogether. Instead, they might use assistive technology devices in place of standard input devices. These devices typically include buttons and analog controls that require less force to activate than standard devices. These devices can also support the use of larger buttons that the head, foot, elbow, or other larger body parts can activate.

When you approach accessible input solutions, consider the following settings and supports:

- Support a broad range of input devices. Many accessible gaming inputs support keyboard and mouse input. For example, a device might look like a joystick but is recognized as a mouse by the game's software. If a game or platform doesn't support mouse input, a player who requires this device might be excluded from play.
- Provide players an option to adjust joystick sensitivity in-game and at the platform level.

### Dexterity and gaming

Dexterity in the context of gaming refers to the rapid movement of a player's fingers to activate controls within a specific time frame. For example, a game that requires players to activate a series of four different buttons consecutively to perform an attack can pose significant barriers to players with limited dexterity.

You can support players with specific dexterity and fine-motor considerations by providing options that:

- Decrease the number of inputs needed to successfully play a game.
- Allow players to remap all controls in a game.
- Allow players to disable or skip quick-time events.
- Don't require holding down multiple buttons simultaneously.

### Coordination and gaming

The ability to perform smooth, accurate movements of arms, hands, and fingers is important in gaming experiences. Common mechanics like jumping onto moving platforms or aiming at targets can require precise movements of a thumb stick or mouse. Performing these movements with accuracy can make the difference in hitting or missing a target.

Supports that decrease coordination demands, like assistive target-lock settings, can help support these players.

### Endurance and gaming

Endurance typically refers to how long someone can engage in an activity before they become tired. For some players, holding a controller or repeatedly using muscles in the hand, or other body parts used to activate game controls, can cause fatigue or pain after short periods.

Common game mechanics that tend to introduce fatigue include quick, repetitive button presses and holding buttons for prolonged periods. Approaches to support these players include providing them with the ability to:

- Change input demands from button holds to button presses.
- Allow players to pause a game or initiate game saves at any point in time.
- Provide toggle-based settings like autofire and autorun.
