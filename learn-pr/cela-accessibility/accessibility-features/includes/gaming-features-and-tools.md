## Copilot
Just like other digital activities, gaming must be accessible for all. Copilot mode on Windows 10 PCs and Xbox One links two controllers so you can use them as if they were one controller. Once linked, both controllers have full control, and you can use either controller however you like. This can be useful for gamers with mobility disabilities or for collaborative gaming when one gamer needs assistance.

There are several ways to take advantage of Copilot mode:

1. A single person can use two controllers simultaneously. For example, if someone is playing a game, they could hold one controller in each hand. A gamer could also use one controller with a hand and the other with a foot, or one with a hand and the other with their chin. This option can be helpful for gamers with mobility disabilities to play the way that works best for them.
2. Two people can play collaboratively with two different controllers. For example, two people can share a single avatar (character, vehicle, etc.) with controls divided between players. The two players can swap control as needed, leading to true cooperative play.
3. Two people can control a game interchangeably. One person can play as the pilot with primary control while the second player is the copilot who can step in as needed. For example, if a parent is teaching a child, they can let the child take the lead and help with specific tasks as needed using the second controller.

To turn on Copilot for Xbox One:

1. Connect a second controller to the Xbox for the copilot. The copilot can sign in or not---achievements and gamerscore do not go to this player.
2. Using the pilot\'s controller, press the **Xbox** button to open the guide, and then select **System** \> **Settings** \> **Ease of Access** \> **Controller**.
3. Choose **Copilot settings**, and then select **Turn on Copilot**.
4. Select the copilot controller.

## Xbox Adaptive Controller
The Xbox Adaptive Controller is a hub for devices to make gaming more accessible. The controller features large programmable buttons and can be connected to external switches, buttons, mounts, and joysticks to create a custom controller experience. The Xbox Adaptive Controller is designed primarily to meet the needs of gamers with limited mobility. For example, if a person has limited mobility with their hands, they can put the controller on the floor and use their feet to press the larger buttons. A gamer with limited mobility in their left arm could connect an assistive device such as a joystick to use as an alternative to the buttons. The Xbox Adaptive Controller can also be used with Copilot for cooperative gaming or shared control of a game.
