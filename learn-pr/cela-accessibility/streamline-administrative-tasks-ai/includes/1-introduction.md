Special education teams navigate a wide range of administrative responsibilities, including drafting IEP updates, writing progress notes, coordinating with service providers, preparing documentation for meetings, and organizing data that informs decisions. These tasks are essential, yet they are often time‑intensive and can limit time available for instruction, collaboration, and meaningful student connection.

Some educators explore AI tools such as Copilot and Teach in the Microsoft 365 Copilot App to support parts of administrative work that are repetitive, detail‑heavy, or follow familiar patterns. Copilot may be helpful for draft writing, refining language, summarizing information, or adjusting tone for family communication. Teach can support the creation of clear structures for materials used regularly, such as lesson plans, weekly templates, or data‑collection notes.

When used thoughtfully, these tools may support existing workflows while keeping accuracy, compliance, and student‑specific needs at the center. Professional judgment remains essential. The purpose of AI support is not to replace educator decision‑making, but to reduce time spent on drafting and organization so educators can focus more fully on teaching, planning, and collaboration with students, families, and colleagues.
