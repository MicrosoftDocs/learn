Teach can be a helpful option when administrative or planning work follows familiar formats that educators complete regularly, such as lesson plans, rubrics, data‑collection templates, weekly updates, or accommodation check‑ins. The Teach space offers guided support grounded in educational standards, helping educators start materials like lesson plans, rubrics, and flashcards with commonly expected components already in view. Additional tools, such as support for quizzes, reading‑level adjustments, and differentiated activities, continue to evolve over time. Some educators choose Teach for tasks where having a clear starting structure helps keep work organized and consistent.

When using Teach for one of these structured tasks, educators choose the type of material they want to create and respond to prompts for key details, such as learning goals, activities, materials, timing, and standards alignment. After reviewing and adjusting the content, materials can be moved into Word or Teams for collaboration or continued editing. If parts of the document need to be more personalized, such as revising language for a specific group of students or clarifying directions for families, Copilot can be used to support those targeted refinements. This approach allows educators to move between tools in ways that fit their own planning habits while keeping instructional relevance, accuracy, and professional judgment at the center.
