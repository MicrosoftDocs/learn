Administrative tasks are a core part of special education practice, and AI tools can meaningfully reduce the time required to complete them. Teach provides guided, standards-aligned workflows that support consistency, while Copilot helps refine, summarize, and personalize student-specific content. Used together, Teach and Copilot can help special education teachers streamline IEP preparation, documentation, lesson planning, and communication while keeping accuracy, compliance, and student needs front and center.

In this module, you learned to:

- Use **Copilot** for individualized writing tasks requiring nuance and clarity.
- Use **Teach** for structured, repeatable workflows and standards-aligned materials.
