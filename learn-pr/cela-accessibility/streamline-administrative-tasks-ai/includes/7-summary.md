Administrative work is a significant part of special education practice, and educators explore different approaches to manage it effectively. AI tools such as Teach and Copilot can offer support in ways that respect professional judgment and existing workflows. Teach provides optional, guided structures for predictable tasks, while Copilot supports more nuanced work such as refining language, summarizing information, and adapting content for different audiences. Used thoughtfully, these tools can help reduce repetitive effort while keeping accuracy, compliance, and student needs at the center of decision making.
