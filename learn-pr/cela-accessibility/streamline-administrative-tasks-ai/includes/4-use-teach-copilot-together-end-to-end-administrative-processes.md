Teach and Copilot complement one another, especially for multistep administrative tasks like IEP preparation, student progress reviews, or meeting follow-up. Teach handles the **structure**—guiding you through the steps you must consistently complete—while Copilot handles the **personalization**, rewriting, summarizing, or adapting content based on student data or audience needs.

To complete an end-to-end workflow, begin by opening Teach to capture your structured thinking. For example, when preparing for an IEP meeting, Teach can walk you through identifying strengths, areas of need, data summaries, and discussion points. Export these structured notes to Word, then use Copilot to rewrite sections into plain language for families, create a brief meeting agenda, or draft a follow-up email summarizing next steps. This pairing helps teachers complete complex administrative tasks efficiently while applying responsible AI use and effective prompting practices.
