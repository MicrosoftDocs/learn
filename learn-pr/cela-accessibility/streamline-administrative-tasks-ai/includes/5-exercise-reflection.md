Consider an administrative task completed regularly, such as progress notes, lesson planning, or weekly communication with families. Reflect briefly on the following questions:

- Which parts of this task tend to follow a predictable structure that could be supported with Teach?
- Which parts involve more nuanced, individualized writing where Copilot might be helpful?
- In what ways could pairing Teach and Copilot support clarity, consistency, or accessibility while saving time?
- What responsible AI considerations would guide use of these tools, such as privacy, accuracy, tone, or alignment with professional and legal expectations?

This reflection is intended to support exploration of optional approaches. Educators and special education team members remain in control of how and whether tools are used to support practice.
