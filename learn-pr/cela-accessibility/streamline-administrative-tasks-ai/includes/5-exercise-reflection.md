Choose one administrative task you complete regularly—such as progress notes, lesson plans, or weekly parent communication. In a brief paragraph, reflect on the following:

- Which parts of this task follow a predictable structure that could be built in Teach?
- Which parts require nuanced, individualized writing that would benefit from Copilot?
- How could using Teach and Copilot together save you time while improving clarity, consistency, or accessibility?
- What responsible-AI considerations would you need to keep in mind (privacy, tone, accuracy, etc.)?
