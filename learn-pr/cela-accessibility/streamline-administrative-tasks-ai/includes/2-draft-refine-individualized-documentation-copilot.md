Documentation in special education requires accuracy, clarity, and sensitivity. Whether summarizing observations, preparing present levels, drafting progress notes, or writing follow‑up communication for families, educators often juggle large volumes of information.

**Copilot** can help by generating a clear initial draft that team members can refine.

Here's an example of how you might use Copilot to help draft progress notes:

1. **Gather raw information** (assessment notes, student work samples, observation logs).
1. **Prompt Copilot** with what you need and for whom, removing any personal information:

   "Draft a plain language progress note using the data below. Keep strengths visible, align comments to the student's IEP goal, and create a short next step recommendation."

1. **Review** the draft for accuracy, tone, and alignment with professional expectations.
1. **Revise** to ensure the final output reflects educator expertise and student specific context.
