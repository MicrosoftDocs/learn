Many administrative tasks in special education require nuanced, individualized writing—progress notes, present level updates, family-friendly explanations of student data, and follow-up summaries after meetings. Copilot is ideal for these tasks because it works directly with your documents and data to help refine language, improve clarity, and organize complex information. This section focuses on how to apply Copilot specifically to special education documentation.

To complete an individualized task, start by opening your working document and gathering the student-specific notes or data you want to include. Remember to remove any PII information for privacy. Then ask Copilot to help organize or express the information more clearly—for example: _"Draft a concise progress note using the data below that is appropriate for inclusion in an IEP update."_ Paste in your data, and Copilot will produce a structured draft. You then refine details, ensure accuracy and compliance, and tailor the tone for your audience. This workflow helps you move quickly from raw data to polished, student-centered documentation that still reflects your professional judgment.
