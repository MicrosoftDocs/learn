Teach and Copilot often work well together during multi‑step administrative work such as IEP preparation, student progress reviews, or meeting follow‑up. Teach can provide a consistent way to organize required components, while Copilot can help refine language, summarize notes, or adapt content to better fit student needs or family audiences once that structure is in place.

To complete an end-to-end workflow, begin by opening Teach to capture your structured thinking. For example, when preparing for an IEP meeting, Teach can walk you through identifying strengths, areas of need, data summaries, and discussion points. Export these structured notes to Word, then use Copilot to rewrite sections into plain language for families, create a brief meeting agenda, or draft a follow up email summarizing next steps. This pairing helps teachers complete complex administrative tasks efficiently while applying responsible AI use and effective prompting practices.
