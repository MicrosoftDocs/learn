In this unit, learn about the importance of collaborating with the gaming and disability community.

## What is the meaning of "nothing about us without us"?

The slogan "nothing about us without us" represents the message that technologies used by people with disabilities should be developed in collaboration with the disability community. In other words, accessible products and experiences should be designed with the disability community, not for the disability community.

Engaging these communities to develop bespoke accessibility settings or features is crucial.

> [!NOTE]
> There are about 429 million gamers in the world who have disabilities. That's almost 20 percent of the total population of gamers worldwide.
> Including the perspectives of individuals with disabilities for all development efforts helps inform results that are accessible for a sizable portion of the gamer market.

## How can community collaboration inform accessible design?

Players with disabilities are the experts in their own experiences. As you build your understanding of game accessibility, game elements and design features that are likely to introduce accessibility barriers might become more obvious.

Only people who actively experience these barriers and try to use the accessible features or solutions can accurately weigh in on factors like:

- What makes the element or mechanic inaccessible to someone with their specific experiences?
- What can be done to support these players as they encounter these barriers?
- Can these barriers be eliminated altogether?

Players who have experience gaming with a disability can help identify barriers that weren't apparent to the development team.
