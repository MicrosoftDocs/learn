Here are some considerations to keep in mind during the design phase:

## Content that can be presented in different ways without losing information or structure

Use semantic HTML elements to ensure a logical structure. Headings (**\<h1>** to **\<h6>**) help define the hierarchy of the content, lists (**\<ul>**, **\<ol>**, **\<li>**) organize items, and tables (**\<table>**, **\<tr>**, **\<th>**, **\<td>**) present data in a structured format. This adaptability ensures that screen readers can navigate and interpret the content effectively.

## Proper naming

Involves using clear and descriptive names for elements, such as form controls, buttons, and links. This helps screen readers convey the purpose of these elements to users. For example, instead of naming a button "Submit," you might use "Submit Application" to provide more context.

## Role assignment

Involves using ARIA roles to define the purpose of elements on a web page. ARIA roles, such as button, link, dialog, and navigation, help screen readers understand the function of each element. For example, using the **role="button"** attribute on a custom button element ensures that screen readers recognize it as a button. Note that these aren't needed for native HTML tags. 

## Clear navigation mechanisms

Help users understand the structure and boundaries of different sections on a web page. This can be achieved by using semantic HTML elements, such as **\<header>**, **\<nav>**, **\<main>**, **\<article>**, and **\<footer>**. These elements provide clear landmarks and context, allowing screen readers to navigate the content more effectively.

## Informative context-sensitive titles

Providing informative context-sensitive titles for each page is crucial for helping users understand the content and purpose of the page. The **\<title>** element in the HTML **\<head>** section should contain a concise and descriptive title that accurately reflects the content of the page. For example, instead of using a generic title like "Home," you might use "Home - Accessibility Resources."

## Additional tips

- Utilize proper HTML elements to convey the structure and purpose of content.
- Plan a logical and intuitive focus order for keyboard navigation.
- Provide meaningful alt text for images, describing their content and purpose. Avoid using images of text and use real text instead, except for brand logos. 
- Use ARIA roles, states, and properties to convey additional information about elements when needed.
- Design consistent navigation patterns and element locations across pages.
- Clearly identify and describe errors in forms and other interactive elements.
- Plan to notify screen readers of changes in dynamic content using ARIA live regions.
- Ensure all functionality is accessible via keyboard without requiring a mouse.
- When user input is required, provide instructions or labels describing necessary input and expected data formats to prevent validation errors.
- Ensure elements are in a meaningful sequence or reading order. 
- Expose the content of text objects, text attributes, and the boundary of text rendered to the screen. In data tables, ensure row and column headers are properly exposed for screen readers.
