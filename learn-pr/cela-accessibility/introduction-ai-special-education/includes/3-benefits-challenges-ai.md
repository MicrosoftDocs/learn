Teachers often juggle lesson planning for multiple ability levels, adapting materials for students who need accommodations, and managing family and caregiver communication. These responsibilities can impact the time teachers spend directly engaging with students. The benefits of AI lie in its ability to ease these burdens. AI can draft plain-language family and caregiver communications, summarize progress notes, and generate first-draft differentiated activities, giving educators more time for instruction and student support. For example, an elementary teacher might draft a newsletter in **Microsoft 365** **Copilot** and use **Microsoft Translator** to provide versions in Spanish and Mandarin. Or a high school English teacher might use **Copilot** to create additional versions of a reading passage. Teachers can interact with Copilot [wherever it appears](/microsoft-365/education/guide/1-reference/baseline-reference-copilot), whether in Word, PowerPoint, Teams, or Outlook, to streamline these tasks without leaving their workflow.

However, the challenges are equally significant. As AI adoption grows, clear guardrails are essential to protect students and uphold legal requirements. A recent study from the [Center for Democracy and Technology](https://cdt.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025-10-28-CDT-AI-IEP-Brief-1.pdf) found that 57% of teachers reported using AI to develop an IEP or 504 plan in the 2024-2025 school year, up from 39% the previous year. This rapid growth highlights both the perceived time-saving benefits and the urgent need for responsible practices. Without proper oversight, AI-generated content can introduce risks such as inaccurate information, bias, and potential violations of privacy laws like FERPA and IDEA. Teachers must remain the decision-makers, ensuring that every AI-assisted output is reviewed, individualized, and compliant.
