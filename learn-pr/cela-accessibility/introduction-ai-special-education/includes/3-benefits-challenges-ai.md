Teachers balance many responsibilities, from planning lessons for a wide range of ability levels to adapting materials and maintaining steady communication with families and caregivers. These responsibilities can stretch the time available for direct instruction and student support. Some educators explore AI tools as one option to ease routine tasks while keeping full professional oversight.

AI can help draft plain‑language communications, summarize progress notes, or generate differentiated activities, but these tools are simply resources teachers may use when they feel they are helpful. For example, an elementary teacher might choose to draft a class newsletter with Microsoft 365 Copilot and then use Microsoft Translator to offer versions in Spanish or Mandarin. A high school English teacher might use Copilot to adjust the reading level of a passage to support comprehension. These are optional supports that educators, service providers, and specialists can integrate only if the workflow fits their needs.

As more schools experiment with AI, thoughtful guardrails become increasingly important to protect students and meet legal requirements. A recent study from the [Center for Democracy and Technology](https://cdt.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025-10-28-CDT-AI-IEP-Brief-1.pdf) found that 57% of teachers reported using AI to develop an IEP or 504 plan in the 2024-2025 school year, up from 39% the previous year. This rapid growth highlights both the perceived time-saving benefits and the urgent need for responsible practices. Without proper oversight, AI-generated content can introduce risks such as inaccurate information, bias, and potential violations of privacy laws like FERPA and IDEA. 

Teachers, case managers, and related service providers remain the decision makers. Any AI‑assisted output should be reviewed, individualized, and checked for compliance before being used. AI supports, not replaces, the expertise, judgment, and relationships at the heart of special education.
