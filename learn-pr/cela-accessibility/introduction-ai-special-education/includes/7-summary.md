AI offers powerful opportunities to enhance teaching and learning in special education by reducing administrative burdens and enabling more personalized, accessible instruction. From drafting multilingual family communications to creating differentiated lesson materials, AI can help teachers reclaim time for direct student engagement. However, these benefits come with responsibilities. Educators must remain in control, review all AI‑generated content for accuracy and bias, and safeguard student privacy. Microsoft’s Responsible AI Principles—fairness, reliability and safety, privacy and security, inclusiveness, transparency, and accountability—provide a framework for ethical practice. By applying these principles and maintaining transparency with families and colleagues, teachers can use AI to improve outcomes while protecting trust and compliance.
