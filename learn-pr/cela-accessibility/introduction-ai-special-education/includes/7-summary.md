AI can offer helpful ways to support teaching and learning in special education by easing routine tasks and opening space for more personalized, accessible instruction. Whether drafting multilingual family communications or preparing differentiated lesson materials, these tools can help educators reclaim time for direct student support when they choose to use them. At the same time, thoughtful practice remains essential. Educators stay in control by reviewing AI‑generated content for accuracy, bias, and privacy considerations. Microsoft's Responsible AI Principles—fairness, reliability and safety, privacy and security, inclusiveness, transparency, and accountability—provide a useful guide for ethical use. With clear guardrails and open communication with families and colleagues, special education teams can integrate AI in ways that strengthen outcomes while maintaining trust, compliance, and educator expertise at the center.
