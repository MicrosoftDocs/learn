Artificial intelligence offers tremendous potential to transform special education by supporting teachers in creating more inclusive, personalized learning experiences while reducing administrative burden. Key takeaways from this module include:

**AI's Role:** AI serves as a powerful assistant for differentiation, accessibility, communication, and data analysis—but always under teacher supervision and guidance.

**Benefits:** Time savings, improved accessibility features, enhanced communication with multilingual families, and data-driven insights for better instructional decisions.

**Challenges:** Privacy concerns, potential bias, accuracy issues, and the need for compliance with FERPA and IDEA regulations.

**Responsible Implementation:** Follow the six-step workflow (Plan, Prompt, Review, Record, Communicate, Evaluate) guided by Microsoft's Responsible AI Principles to ensure ethical, effective use.

**Moving Forward:** Start small with approved tools, maintain transparency with families and colleagues, and continuously evaluate impact on student outcomes. Remember that your professional expertise remains irreplaceable—AI simply amplifies your ability to serve students with diverse learning needs.

As you begin implementing AI in your practice, focus on tools and applications that directly support your students' IEP goals while maintaining the individualized, relationship-centered approach that defines excellent special education.
