Special educators, and the full special education ecosystem that supports students, including general educators, related service providers, paras, psychologists, and administrators, bring deep expertise and essential professional judgment to instructional decision‑making. As responsibilities grow, educators are exploring tools like AI to support planning, communication, and accessibility without replacing human insight at the core of teaching. Because learning new tools adds to already heavy workloads, AI must be introduced in ways that respect educators' time, validate their expertise, and build trust through clear guardrails, transparency, and supportive training.

When used thoughtfully, AI can enhance existing practices by streamlining drafting tasks, strengthening accessibility, and expanding the ways educators communicate with families. Ultimately, educators and special education teams decide when and how these tools fit their practice, ensuring outputs align with instructional goals, student needs, and district expectations.
