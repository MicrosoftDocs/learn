Welcome to this comprehensive guide on artificial intelligence in special education. As educators working with students who have diverse learning needs, you face unique challenges in creating inclusive environments while managing administrative demands. This module will explore how AI can support your teaching practice, enhance student outcomes, and streamline your workflow—all while maintaining the highest standards of responsibility and student-centered care.

Throughout this module, you'll learn practical applications of AI tools, understand the benefits and potential challenges, and develop a framework for responsible implementation. Remember that AI is designed to augment your professional expertise, not replace the critical human judgment that makes you an effective special education teacher.
