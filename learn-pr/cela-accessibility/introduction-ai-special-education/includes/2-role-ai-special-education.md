AI can provide support to special education teams as they create inclusive learning environments and manage growing responsibilities. Students' needs require instruction aligned with IEP goals, lesson plans adapted to different reading levels, and translated materials that help multilingual families participate fully in IEP discussions. Accessibility features such as **Immersive Reader**, **text to speech**, and **live captioning** can give students more independent ways to engage with content. AI tools can also assist with administrative tasks including drafting progress reports, preparing schedules, and reviewing student performance data to identify patterns that inform instructional decisions and meet compliance requirements. These supports help create more time for direct teaching, collaboration with specialists, and communication with families. AI enhances professional practice rather than replacing educator expertise, reinforcing responsible, student-centered use aligned with Microsoft Responsible AI principles.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> AI is a support tool that augments teacher expertise rather than a substitute for professional judgment, setting the foundation for responsible, student-centered practice guided by [*Microsoft's Responsible AI Principles*](https://www.microsoft.com/ai/principles-and-approach)
