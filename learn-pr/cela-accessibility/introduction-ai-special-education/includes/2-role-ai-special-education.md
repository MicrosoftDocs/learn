Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming special education by helping teachers, across all grade levels and subjects, create inclusive learning environments and manage time more effectively. As a special education teacher, you work with students who have diverse needs and require tailored supports aligned with IEP goals. AI can assist by generating differentiated lesson plans, adapting reading levels for students with varying literacy skills, and providing real-time translation for multilingual families during IEP meetings. Accessibility features such as **Immersive Reader**, **text-to-speech**, and **live captioning** empower students with disabilities to engage more independently. Beyond instruction, AI can support critical administrative tasks like drafting progress reports and scheduling meetings, while also analyzing student performance data to identify trends, monitor progress over time, and inform targeted interventions. These insights help ensure that instructional decisions are evidence-based and aligned with compliance requirements, freeing up time for direct teaching and collaboration with specialist.
