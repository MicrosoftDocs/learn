Not all families can attend live meetings due to work schedules, caregiving responsibilities, or accessibility needs. Providing asynchronous options ensures communication remains inclusive and respectful of families' time. Copilot tools make this process efficient and culturally responsive by enabling educators to share information in multiple formats.

When live participation isn't possible, educators can use Microsoft Translator, Teams, and Copilot to create accessible, multilingual resources. For example, after an IEP meeting, the special education team can record the session, enable transcription, and translate the transcript into the family's preferred language. Then, Copilot can generate a plain-language summary and culturally respectful email that includes next steps and links to resources.

Imagine a parent who works night shifts and misses a scheduled meeting. The educator records the meeting and enables transcription. They could then copy and paste the transcript into Microsoft Word and use Translator to convert to the family's preferred language. Using Copilot, the educator drafts a clear summary email with bullet points, attaches an accessible PDF, and includes a link to a short video recap with captions. This approach ensures parents feel informed and valued without added stress.
