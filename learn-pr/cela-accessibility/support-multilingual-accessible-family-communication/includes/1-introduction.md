Clear, supportive communication with families is essential, and educators already bring deep expertise in building those relationships. At the same time, language differences and complex educational terminology can make conversations harder for families to fully access. This module shows how AI tools, used thoughtfully and with professional oversight, can take on some of the time‑consuming pieces, like translating documents or simplifying technical language, so you can stay focused on connection and care. You'll explore practical ways to make live and asynchronous meetings more accessible for multilingual families and for parents with disabilities. By the end, you'll have strategies that preserve your voice, reflect your judgment, and make communication more efficient without replacing the human trust at the heart of every family partnership.
