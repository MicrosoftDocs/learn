Families need clear, understandable information to support their child's learning, and educators already work hard to make complex information accessible. Documents like IEPs and progress reports can include technical language that feels overwhelming creating unintentional barriers to partnership. 

To remove barriers for families, educators can use tools like Copilot and Microsoft Translator to make complex information clearer while staying firmly in control of the message. Start with the English version of an IEP goal or progress update in Microsoft Word, then use Copilot to rewrite the content in plain, parent‑friendly language without changing its intent. Review the wording to ensure it reflects your professional judgment and the student's needs. When ready, use Microsoft Translator by selecting the **Review Tab** > **Language** > **Translate** > Choose **Translate Selection** or **Translate Document** to provide a version in the family's preferred language, noting that the translation was generated with AI. This workflow saves time on manual rewriting and translation checks, keeps educators' expertise at the center, and helps families receive information that is accurate, culturally responsive, and easy to act on.
