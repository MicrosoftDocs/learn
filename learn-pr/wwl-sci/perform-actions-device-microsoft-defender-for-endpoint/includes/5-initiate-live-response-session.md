Live response provides security operations teams instantaneous access to a device using a remote shell connection. Live response provides you with the power to do in-depth investigation and take immediate response actions to promptly contain identified threats.

Live response is designed to enhance investigations by enabling your security operations team to collect forensic data, run scripts, send suspicious entities for analysis, remediate threats, and proactively hunt for emerging threats.

With live response, analysts can do all of the following tasks:

- Run basic and advanced commands to do investigative work on a device.

- Download files such as malware samples and outcomes of PowerShell scripts.

- Download files in the background (new!).

- Upload a PowerShell script or executable to the library and run it on a device from a tenant level.

- Take or undo remediation actions.

## Prerequisites

Before you can start a session on a device, make sure you fulfill the following requirements:

**Verify that you're running a supported version of Windows 10 or later**

You need to enable the live response capability in the Advanced features settings page.

Only users with **Manage Portal Settings** permissions can enable these settings.

**Ensure that the device has an Automation Remediation level assigned to it**

You need to enable, at least, the minimum Remediation Level for a given Device Group. Otherwise you can't establish a Live Response session to a member of that group.

**Enable live response unsigned script execution (optional)**

Allowing the use of unsigned scripts may increase your exposure to threats. Running unsigned scripts isn't recommended as it can increase your exposure to threats. If you must use them however, you need to enable the setting in the Advanced features settings page.

**Ensure that you have the appropriate permissions**

Only users who have been provisioned with the appropriate permissions can initiate a session. The option to upload a file to the library is only available to users with the appropriate Role-based access control (RBAC) permissions. The button is greyed out for users with only delegated permissions. Depending on the role that's been granted to you, you can run basic or advanced live response commands. Users' permissions are controlled by RBAC custom role.

## Live response dashboard overview

When you initiate a live response session on a device, a dashboard opens. The dashboard provides information about the session like:

- Who created the session

- When the session started

- The duration of the session

The dashboard also gives you access to:

- Disconnect session

- Upload files to the library

- Command console

- Command log

## Live response commands

Depending on the role that's been granted to you, you can run basic or advanced live response commands. User permissions are controlled by RBAC custom roles.   Live response is a cloud-based interactive shell. So, specific command experience may vary in response time depending on network quality and system load between the end user and the target device.

### Basic commands

The following commands are available for user roles that are granted the ability to run basic live response commands.

| Command| Description|
| :--- | :--- |
| [cd]| Changes the current directory.|
| [cls]| Clears the console screen.|
| [connect]| Starts a live response session to the device.|
| [connections]| Shows all the active connections.|
| [dir]| Shows a list of files and subdirectories in a directory.|
| [getfile] &lt;file_path&gt;| Downloads a file in the background.|
| [drivers]| Shows all drivers installed on the device.|
| [fg] &lt;command ID&gt;| Returns a file download to the foreground.|
| [fileinfo]| Get information about a file.|
| [findfile]| Locates files by a given name on the device.|
| [help]| Provides help information for live response commands.|
| [persistence]| Shows all known persistence methods on the device.|
| [processes]| Shows all processes running on the device.|
| [registry]| Shows registry values.|
| [scheduledtasks]| Shows all scheduled tasks on the device.|
| [services]| Shows all services on the device.|
| [trace]| Sets the terminal's logging mode to debug.|

### Advanced commands

The following commands are available for user roles that are granted the ability to run advanced live response commands.

| Command| Description|
| :--- | :--- |
| analyze| Analyses the entity with various incrimination engines to reach a verdict.|
| getfile| Gets a file from the device. This command has a prerequisite command. You can use the -auto command with getfile to automatically run the prerequisite command.|
| run| Runs a PowerShell script from the library on the device.|
| library| Lists files that were uploaded to the live response library.|
| putfile| Puts a file from the library to the device. Files are saved in a working folder and are deleted when the device restarts by default.|
| remediate| Remediates an entity on the device. The remediation action will vary depending on the entity type. This command has a prerequisite command. You can use the -auto command with remediate to automatically run the prerequisite command.|
| Undo| Restores an entity that was remediated.|

## Use live response commands

The commands that you can use in the console follow similar principles as Windows Commands. The advanced commands offer expanded capabilities that allow you to take more powerful actions. Advanced actions include downloading or uploading a file, running scripts on the device, and taking remediation actions on an entity.

### Get a file from the device

For scenarios when you'd like to get a file from a device you're investigating, you can use the [getfile] command. The [getfile] command allows you to save the file from the device for further investigation.

The following file size limits apply:

- getfile limit: 3 GB

- fileinfo limit: 10 GB

- library limit: 250 MB

### Download a file in the background

To enable your security operations team to continue investigating an impacted device, files can now be downloaded in the background.

- To download a file in the background, in the live response command console, type **getfile &lt;file_path&gt;**.

- If you're waiting for a file to be downloaded, you can move it to the background by using **Ctrl + Z**.

- To bring a file download to the foreground, in the live response command console, type **fg &lt;command_id&gt;**.

Here are some examples:

| Command| What it does|
| :--- | :--- |
| getfile "C:\windows\some_file.exe" | Starts downloading a file named some_file.exe in the background.|
| fg 1234| Returns a download with command ID 1234 to the foreground.|

### Put a file in the library

Live response has a library where you can put files in. The library stores files (such as scripts) that can be run in a live response session at the tenant level. Live response allows PowerShell scripts to run. However, you must first put the files into the library before you can run them. You can have a collection of PowerShell scripts that can run on devices that you initiate live response sessions with.

To upload a file in the library:

1. Select **Upload file to library**.

1. Select **Browse** and select the file.

1. Provide a brief description.

1. Specify if you'd like to overwrite a file with the same name.

1. If you'd like to be, know what parameters are needed for the script, select the script parameters check box. In the text field, enter an example and a description.

1. Select **Confirm**.

1. (Optional) To verify that the file was uploaded to the library, run the library command.

### Cancel a command

Anytime during a session, you can cancel a command by pressing CTRL + C.

### Automatically run prerequisite commands

Some commands have prerequisite commands to run. If you don't run the prerequisite command, you get an error. For example, running the download command without *fileinfo* will return an error. You can use the auto flag to automatically run prerequisite commands, for example:

```console
getfile c:\Users\user\Desktop\work.txt -auto

```

### Run a PowerShell script

Before you can run a PowerShell script, you must first upload it to the library. After uploading the script to the library, use the **run** command to run the script. If you plan to use an unsigned script in the session, you need to enable the setting in the Advanced features settings page.

### Apply command parameters

View the console help to learn about command parameters. To learn about an individual command, run:

```PowerShell
help <command name>

```

When applying parameters to commands, parameters are handled based on a fixed order:

```PowerShell
<command name> param1 param2

```

When specifying parameters outside of the fixed order, specify the name of the parameter with a hyphen before providing its value:

```PowerShell
<command name> -param2_name param2

```

When using commands that have prerequisite commands, you can use flags:

```PowerShell
<command name> -type file -id <file path> - auto or remediate file <file path> - auto.

```

### Supported output types

Live response supports table and JSON format output types. For each command, there's a default output behavior. You can modify the output in your preferred output format using the following commands:

- -output json

- -output table

### Supported output pipes

Live response supports output piping to CLI and file. CLI is the default output behavior. You can pipe the output to a file using the following command: [command] > [filename].txt.

### View the command log

Select the Command log tab to see the commands used on the device during a session. Each command is tracked with full details such as:

- ID

- Command line

- Duration

- Status and input or output side bar

## Command examples

The next commands are examples that demonstrate the use of the live response commands.
