Transitioning workloads to the cloud involves more than just moving servers, websites, and data. Companies need to think about how to secure those resources, by defining authorized users. Next, companies need to ensure that users only have access to data that they need, that user authorization is limited only create services available to them, and that users only perform operations authorized for them to perform. Access to cloud-based workloads is controlled centrally in two ways. First by providing a definitive identity for each user that they use for every service. Then second by ensuring employees and vendors have enough access to do their jobs.

Azure helps to make these sorts of challenges easier to solve with Microsoft Entra ID, the Microsoft cloud-based identity and access management service. Microsoft Entra ID provides end-to-end identity management; including single sign-on and multifactor authentication to help protect your users and your data.
