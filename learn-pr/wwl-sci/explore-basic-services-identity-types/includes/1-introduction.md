When it comes to security, your organization can no longer rely on its network boundary. To allow employees, partners, and customers to collaborate securely, organizations need to shift to an approach whereby identity becomes the new security perimeter. Using an identity provider helps organizations manage that shift and all the aspects of identity security.
