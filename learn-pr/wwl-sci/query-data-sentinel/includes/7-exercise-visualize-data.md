As a security engineer working for Contoso, you notice suspicious activities in your Azure subscription and you decide to analyze this activity by using Microsoft Sentinel workbooks.

## Exercise: Query and visualize data with Microsoft Sentinel Workbooks

You want to analyze the logs in Microsoft Sentinel from the Azure Activity connector. You want to further implement visualization of this data and save it in a customized workbook.

In this exercise, explore logs and Microsoft Sentinel Workbooks. You perform the following tasks:

- Interact with logs data in the Microsoft Sentinel **Logs** page.
- Create and edit a custom workbook to visualize important data.

> [!NOTE]
> You must have completed the [Query and visualize data with Microsoft Sentinel Workbooks](../2-exercise-setup.yml) unit before you can complete this exercise. If you have not done so, complete it now, and then continue with the exercise steps.

### Task 1: Work with Logs in Microsoft Sentinel

1. In the Azure portal, search for and select **Microsoft Sentinel**, and then select the previously created Microsoft Sentinel workspace.
1. On the **Microsoft Sentinel** page, in the **General** section, select **Logs**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > When you open the **Logs** page for the first time, you might be redirected to the **Queries** window. Close the **Queries** window and return to the **New Query 1** section.

1. On the **Microsoft Sentinel | Logs** page, in the **Tables** pane, from the **Group by: Solution** dropdown menu, select **Category**.
1. In the **Tables** pane, from the list of tables, expand the **Azure Resources** category, move the cursor over the **Azure Activity** table or use the **Tab** key to navigate to the table, and then select **Preview data**.
1. In the **AzureActivity** window, select **See in query editor**. This option enables you to preview the data and to check if the results are as you expect before you actually run a query with it.

   In the **Query** section, you can observe the query structure. This query searches and presents the last 10 events from the Azure Activity log. The first row in the query, `AzureActivity` specifies the table used in the query. The second line contains a `where` statement that filters the records from the last day. The third line contains another statement to filter only the last 10 events.

   The query results section presents the results of the query. You can expand any of the records to review the values in the table. Select the name of any column to sort the results by that column.

1. Select the filter icon next to it to provide a filter condition. This approach is similar to adding a filter condition to the query itself except that this filter is cleared if you run the query again. If you select the **Columns** dropdown menu, you can filter the columns from the table that you want to display. By selecting **Group columns**, you can group records by a particular column.

   :::image type="content" source="../media/07-query-result.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Query results with the previous items called out." border="true":::

1. Select **Queries** tab in the left pane. This pane includes example queries that you can add to the query window. If you're using your own workspace, you should have various queries in multiple categories. If you're using the demonstration environment, you might only see a single **Log Analytics workspaces** category.

    > [!NOTE]
    > You can try to practice writing queries in the following [demonstration environment](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Monitoring_Logs/DemoLogsBlade).

### Task 2: Work with Workbooks in Microsoft Sentinel

1. On the **Microsoft Sentinel** page, in the **Threat Management** section, select **Workbooks**.
1. On the **Microsoft Sentinel | Workbooks** page, select the **Templates** tab.
1. In the **Search** field, enter and select **Azure Activity**.
1. In the details pane, review the information provided for the template, and then select **Save**. In the **Save workbook toâ€¦** window, select the same location that you selected in the preparation exercise, and then select **OK**.
1. On the **Microsoft Sentinel | Workbooks** page, select **My workbooks** tab. From the list of saved templates, select **Azure Activity**. Then in the details pane, select **View saved workbook**.
1. On **Azure Activity-** *sentinelname* page, review all the elements of the workbook. You can interact with the workbook by selecting some of the elements.
1. Select the **Time range** field to select a different time range for the records presented in the **Azure Activity** table. Select the **Caller** dropdown menu to filter the records based on the user or service that generates the events. Select the **Resource Group** dropdown menu to filter the events based on a specific resource group.

   :::image type="content" source="../media/07-default-workbook.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Azure Activity page, with the previous elements called out." border="true":::

1. Scroll down to the **Caller activities** table, which displays the activities run by your users or security principals. Sort the table data in each column by selecting the arrows in the column header.
1. Scroll up to the header bar in the **Azure Activity-** *sentinelname* page. Select the **Edit** option to switch the workbook to the editing mode. Observe the various **Edit** options that display on the page.
1. Select the first **Edit** option. This action displays the editing pane for one of the steps in the workbook. You can customize the presentation of the elements by adjusting the style and reordering them in different order.
1. You can add other parameters with different types such as text, dropdown, multivalues, or similar.
1. Select **Add parameters**.
1. In the **New Parameter** page, enter the following values:

   | Name | Description |
   |:-----|:------------|
   | **Parameter name** | Level |
   | **Display name** | Level |
   | **Parameter type** | From the dropdown menu, select **Drop down**. |
   | **Required?** | Select this checkbox. |
   | **Allow multiple selections** | Select this checkbox. |
   | **Limit multiple selections** | Don't select this checkbox. |
   | **Delimiter** | Retain the default values. |
   | **Quote with** | Retain the default values. |
   | **Explanation** | This parameter filters the events based on the level. |
   | **Hide parameter in reading mode** | Don't select this checkbox. |
   | **Get data from** | Query |

1. In the **Log Analytics workspace Logs Query** section, enter the following query, and then select **Run Query**.

   ```kusto
   AzureActivity
   |summarize by Level
   ```

1. Confirm that the query result returns two types of events based on the level: **Informational** and **Warning**.

1. Select **Save** to commit the changes, and notice the parameter step now includes a parameter called **Level**.

    > [!TIP]
    > In the edit mode, you can select the ellipsis icon next to the **Edit** option to display a new dropdown menu. From that menu, you can move this step to different parts of the workbook. You can also clone or remove the step from the workbook.

1. On the header bar, select the **Save as** icon to save the customized workbook.
1. In the **Title** field, provide a name for the new workbook, and then select **Save**.
1. When you're finished making changes, select **Done Editing**.

   > [!TIP]
   > Your new workbook is accessible from the **Microsoft Sentinel | Workbooks pane** in the **My workbooks** tab. If your new workbook isn't listed, select the **Refresh** option.

### Clean up the resources

1. In the Azure portal, search for **Resource groups**.
1. Select **azure-sentinel-rg**.
1. On the header bar, select **Delete resource group**.
1. In the **TYPE THE RESOURCE GROUP NAME:** field, enter the name of the resource group *azure-sentinel-rg* and select **Delete**.
