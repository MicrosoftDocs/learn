Identity lifecycle management is a cornerstone of effective identity governance. Lifecycle management ensures user access and permissions are managed seamlessly as individuals join, move within, or leave an organization. Microsoft Entra Lifecycle Workflows provide automated solutions to streamline these processes, enhancing security, compliance, and operational efficiency.

Imagine you're an Identity and Access Administrator at a mid-sized financial services firm. Your organization is growing rapidly. There are:

- new employees joining weekly,
- internal promotions creating role changes,
- contractors leaving after project completion.
 
Managing role transitions manually is a time consuming challenge. You run the risk of delays in onboarding, inconsistent access permissions, and potential security risks from inactive accounts. For instance, a recent audit revealed that several former employees still had active credentials, posing a compliance risk. To address these issues, your team decides to implement Microsoft Entra Lifecycle Workflows. By automating tasks like account creation, permission updates, and access revocation, you aim to improve efficiency, enhance security, and ensure regulatory compliance. This module guides you through using these tools to tackle such challenges effectively.
