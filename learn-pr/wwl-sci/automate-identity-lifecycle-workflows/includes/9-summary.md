In this module, we addressed the challenges of managing user access and permissions throughout their lifecycle in an organization. By using Microsoft Entra Lifecycle Workflows, we automated key processes for onboarding, role changes, and offboarding. The automation reduces manual effort and enhances compliance. Workflows integrate seamlessly with tools like Microsoft Graph APIs and Azure Logic Apps, ensuring secure and efficient identity governance across hybrid environments.

The techniques you learned offer significant advantages, including streamlined identity lifecycle management, reduced operational risks, and improved compliance. Automating Joiner, Mover, and Leaver (JML) scenarios ensure timely access updates, protects sensitive data, and enhances productivity. Additionally, features like workflow templates, task automation, and advanced troubleshooting tools minimize errors and save time, delivering measurable business effect.

You learned about the importance of identity lifecycle management and how Microsoft Entra Lifecycle Workflows automate JML scenarios. We explored prebuilt templates, triggers, and execution conditions to create workflows for tasks like onboarding and offboarding. We also covered deployment planning, advanced automation using Logic Apps, and effective testing strategies. Finally, you learned how to troubleshoot workflows using audit logs, Microsoft Graph APIs, and Security Copilot, as well as manage hybrid identity environments with accurate attribute mapping and governance compliance.
