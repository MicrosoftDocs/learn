Lifecycle workflows in Microsoft Entra help organizations automate and manage user lifecycle processes efficiently.

## Plan a lifecycle workflow deployment in Microsoft Entra
Planning is critical to ensure that lifecycle workflows align with your organization's governance strategy. Follow these steps to prepare for deployment:

- **Engage stakeholders:** Involve representatives from IT administration, security, compliance, HR, and development teams. Each team plays a role in ensuring the workflows meet organizational needs and policies.
- **Define scenarios:** Identify the specific scenarios you want to address, such as onboarding new hires or offboarding employees.
- **Understand prerequisites:** Ensure your organization has the necessary technologies, such as inbound provisioning processes and attribute synchronization for key fields like `employeeHireDate` and `employeeLeaveDateTime`.

> [!NOTE]
> Communication is essential. Inform users about changes to their experience and clarify accountability shifts to resource owners.

## Extend lifecycle workflows with custom task extensions
Lifecycle workflows can be enhanced using custom task extensions and Logic Apps for advanced automation scenarios. Extensions allow workflows to interact with external systems in three ways:

- **Fire-and-forget:** The Logic App starts, and the workflow continues without waiting for a response.
- **Sequential execution with response:** The workflow waits for a response from the Logic App before proceeding.
- **Third-party system integration:** The workflow waits for a response from an external system triggered by the Logic App.

For example, you can create a custom task extension to notify an external system when an employee's job profile changes. Custom task extensions have a limit of 100 per tenant. Plan your extensions accordingly.

## Test and monitor lifecycle workflows for successful deployment
Testing and monitoring are crucial to ensure workflows operate as intended. Follow these best practices:

- **Pilot workflows:** Start with a small group of users or a single test user. Use the on-demand feature to test workflows and evaluate results.
- **Monitor audit logs:** Access audit logs in the Microsoft Entra admin center to verify that all events are properly recorded.
- **Iterate based on feedback:** Review test results, then make necessary adjustments before rolling out workflows to a broader audience.
