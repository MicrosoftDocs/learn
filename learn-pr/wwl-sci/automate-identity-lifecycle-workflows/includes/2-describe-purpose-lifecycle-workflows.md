Lifecycle management is a critical aspect of identity governance, ensuring that user access and permissions are managed effectively throughout their journey within an organization. Microsoft Entra Lifecycle Workflows provide automated solutions to streamline these processes.

## What is identity lifecycle management
Identity lifecycle management refers to the processes involved in managing user identities as they transition through different stages within an organization. These stages are commonly categorized as:
- **Joiner**: When a new user joins the organization and requires access.
- **Mover**: When a user changes roles or departments, necessitating updates to their access.
- **Leaver**: When a user leaves the organization, requiring access revocation and deprovisioning.

Lifecycle management ensures that access is granted, updated, or revoked appropriately, reducing security risks and improving operational efficiency.
