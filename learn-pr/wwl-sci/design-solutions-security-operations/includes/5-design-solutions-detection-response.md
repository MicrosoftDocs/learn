Microsoft Defender XDR is an **eXtended detection and response (XDR) solution** that automatically collects, correlates, and analyzes signal, threat, and alert data from _across_ your Microsoft 365 environment, including _endpoint, email, applications, and identities_. It leverages artificial intelligence (AI) and automation to _automatically_ stop attacks, and remediate affected assets into a safe state.

### Microsoft Defender XDR components secure devices, identity, data, and applications

Microsoft Defender XDR is made up of these security technologies, operating in tandem. You don't need all of these components to benefit from the capabilities of XDR and Microsoft Defender XDR. You will realize gains and efficiencies through using one or two as well.

### Microsoft Defender XDR architecture

The diagram below illustrates high-level architecture for key Microsoft Defender XDR components and integrations. _Detailed_ architecture for each Defender component, and use-case scenarios, are given throughout this series of articles.

![A high-level architecture of the Microsoft Defender portal](../media/m365-defender-eval-architecture.png)

In this illustration:

-   Microsoft Defender XDR combines the signals from all of the Defender components to provide extended detection and response (XDR) across domains. This includes a unified incident queue, automated response to stop attacks, self-healing (for compromised devices, user identities, and mailboxes), cross-threat hunting, and threat analytics.
-   Microsoft Defender for Collaboration safeguards your organization against malicious threats posed by email messages, links (URLs), and collaboration tools. It shares signals resulting from these activities with Microsoft Defender XDR. Exchange Online Protection (EOP) is integrated to provide end-to-end protection for incoming email and attachments.
-   Microsoft Defender for Identity gathers signals from servers running Active Directory Federated Services (AD FS) and on-premises Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS). It uses these signals to protect your hybrid identity environment, including protecting against hackers that use compromised accounts to move laterally across workstations in the on-premises environment.
-   Microsoft Defender for Endpoint gathers signals from and protects devices used by your organization.
-   Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps gathers signals from your organization's use of cloud apps and protects data flowing between your environment and these apps, including both sanctioned and unsanctioned cloud apps.
-   Microsoft Entra ID Protection evaluates risk data from billions of sign-in attempts and uses this data to evaluate the risk of each sign-in to your environment. This data is used by Microsoft Entra ID to allow or prevent account access, depending on how Conditional Access policies are configured. Microsoft Entra ID Protection is licensed separately from Microsoft Defender XDR. It is included with Microsoft Entra ID P2.
