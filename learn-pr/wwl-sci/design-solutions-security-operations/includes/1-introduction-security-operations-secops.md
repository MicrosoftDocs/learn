The primary objective of a cloud security operations (SecOps) function is to detect, respond to, and recover from active attacks on enterprise assets. As SecOps matures, security operations should:

- Reactively respond to attacks detected by tools
- Proactively hunt for attacks that slipped past reactive detections

[The Microsoft Cybersecurity Reference Architecture (MCRA)](https://aka.ms/MCRA) provides guidance for designing end-to-end security using Zero Trust principles and includes detailed diagrams for security operations (SecOps/SOC), helping organizations plan unified operations across hybrid and multicloud environments.

## Security operations strategy overview 

A Zero Trust security framework moves away from trust-by-default toward trust-by-exception. This approach requires reliable mechanisms to establish trust when needed. Since you no longer assume requests are trustworthy, establishing means to attest to the trustworthiness of each request is critical. This attestation requires gaining visibility into the activities on and around the request. 

Adopting a Zero Trust approach across identities, endpoints, infrastructure, and networks increases the number of signals and alerts that Security Operation Center (SOC) analysts must process. An integrated capability is essential to manage this influx of data, defend against threats, and validate trust in transactions.

Modern security operations platforms address this challenge by integrating SIEM, SOAR, XDR, posture management, and AI-assisted capabilities into unified experiences.

## Security operations functions

Security operations teams often focus on three key outcomes:

- **Incident management:** Manage active attacks on the environment, including:
  - **Reactively responding** to detected attacks.
  - **Proactively hunting** for attacks that slipped through traditional threat detections.
  - **Coordinating** the legal, communications, and other business implications of security incidents.
- **Incident preparation:** Help the organization prepare for future attacks. Incident preparation is a broader strategic set of activities that are aimed at building muscle memory and context at all levels of the organization. This strategy prepares people to better handle major attacks and gain insights on security process improvements.
- **Threat intelligence:** Gathering, processing, and disseminating threat intelligence to security operations, security teams, security leadership, and business leadership stakeholders through security leadership.

To deliver against these outcomes, security operations teams should be structured to focus on key outcomes. In larger SecOps teams, the outcomes are often broken out between subteams.

- **Triage (tier 1):** The frontline of response for security incidents. Triage is focused on the high-volume processing of alerts, and typically generated by automation and tools. The triage processes solve for most of common incident types and resolve them within the team. More complex incidents, or new types of incidents, should be escalated to tier 2.
- **Investigation (tier 2):** Focused on incidents that require further investigation, often requiring correlation of data points from multiple sources. This investigation tier looks to provide repeatable solutions to issues escalated to them. It then enables tier 1 to resolve later recurrences of that issue type. Tier 2 also responds to alerts against business critical systems, to reflect the severity of the risk and the need to act quickly.
- **Hunt (tier 3):** Focused primarily on proactive hunting for highly sophisticated attack processes and developing guidance to the wider teams for maturing security controls as a result. The tier 3 team also acts as an escalation point for major incidents in to support forensic analysis and response.

## Modernization

Detecting and responding to threats is currently undergoing significant modernization at all levels.

- **Elevation to business risk management:** SOC is growing into a key component of managing business risk for the organization
- **Metrics and goals:** Tracking SOC effectiveness is evolving from "time to detect" to these key indicators:
  - **Responsiveness** via mean time to acknowledge (MTTA).
  - **Remediation speed** via mean time to remediate (MTTR).
- **Technology evolution:** SOC technology is evolving from exclusive use of static analysis of logs in a SIEM to add the use of specialized tooling and sophisticated analysis techniques. This provides deep insights into assets that provide high quality alerts and investigation experience that complement the breadth view of the SIEM. Both types of tooling are increasingly using AI and machine learning, behavior analytics, and integrated threat intelligence to help spot and prioritize anomalous actions that could be a malicious attacker.
- **AI-assisted security operations:** Generative AI is transforming how SOC analysts work by accelerating investigation and response. AI copilots help analysts quickly summarize incidents, correlate alerts across data sources, generate investigation queries using natural language, and recommend response actions. This assistance reduces the expertise barrier for junior analysts, helps experienced analysts work faster, and enables teams to handle higher alert volumes without proportional staffing increases.
- **Threat hunting:** SOCs are adding hypothesis driven threat hunting to proactively identify advanced attackers and shift noisy alerts out of frontline analyst queues.
- **Incident management:** Discipline is becoming formalized to coordinate nontechnical elements of incidents with legal, communications, and other teams.
- **Integration of internal context:** SOCs are incorporating business context to prioritize activities, including relative risk scores of user accounts and devices, sensitivity of data and applications, and key security isolation boundaries to defend.

## Team composition and key relationships

As security operations modernize, the SOC can no longer operate in isolation. Effective threat detection and response require collaboration across the organization. Security incidents often have legal, regulatory, and business implications that extend beyond technical remediation.

A well-functioning security operations center maintains close relationships with:

- **IT operations:** For coordinated response actions and infrastructure visibility
- **Threat intelligence:** To inform detection priorities and understand adversary tactics
- **Security architecture:** To translate incident learnings into improved security controls
- **Insider risk program:** For investigations involving potential internal threats
- **Legal and human resources:** To address compliance requirements and employee-related incidents
- **Communications teams:** For coordinated messaging during significant security events
- **Risk organization:** To align security priorities with enterprise risk management
- **Industry associations and vendors:** To share threat intelligence and learn from peer experiences

Building these relationships before an incident occurs ensures faster, more coordinated response when attacks happen.
