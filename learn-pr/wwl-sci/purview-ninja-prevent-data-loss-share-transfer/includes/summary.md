To address risks associated with the unsecured sharing of sensitive client data during cross-team collaboration, organizations have strengthened data protection across Exchange Online, SharePoint, OneDrive, and Teams. This has been achieved through IT-led audits, the deployment of automated Data Loss Prevention (DLP) solutions, and mandatory user training, which collectively reduce instances of risky data transfers. Comprehensive strategies now encompass recipient-specific email restrictions and accurate file type detection. They also include sensitivity labeling, access controls, real-time policy tips, and integrated monitoring and alerting. These measures promote accountability and ensure that sensitive information remains protected both in storage and during internal and external collaboration across all supported platforms.

## Key Takeaways

- Automated DLP policies and user education are essential for minimizing accidental data exposure and supporting compliance.

- Exchange Online best practices highlight the importance of recipient conditions, precise file type detection, and integrating alerts with incident response processes.

- SharePoint and OneDrive security relies on layered controls, including sensitivity labels, access restrictions, and monitoring of external sharing, to safeguard files at rest and in transit.

- Microsoft Teams DLP enforces protection for chats, channels, and shared documents. Protections include automated deletion of sensitive messages and document access restrictions for guests and external users.
