Prevent external sharing of sensitive attachments or content with data loss prevention (DLP) in [Exchange Online](/purview/dlp-exchange-conditions-and-actions). Exchange Online is one of the most robust locations in DLP with the most conditions that can be used. This includes some of the best practices that can be used.

- When configuring your Exchange Online DLP Policy, include specific Recipients in your Conditions. By defining which recipients are permitted to receive sensitive information, you can block or restrict emails containing confidential data from being sent to unauthorized individuals or external parties.

  - This proactive approach helps prevent accidental oversharing and ensures that sensitive content is only shared with trusted recipients, reinforcing organizational compliance and data protection standards.

- Use **True File Type Detection** as Exchange Online now supports true file type detection, which goes beyond file extensions to inspect actual content. This prevents evasion tactics like renaming .exe files to .pdf.

  - **Action**: Configure DLP rules using the "File extension" is predicate in the Microsoft Purview portal. This is beneficial as there's a more accurate policy enforcement and reduced false negatives.

- To enhance your DLP strategy in Exchange Online, consider this cohesive approach:

  1. **Configure customized email alerts** for policy matches in Exchange Online. Set up tailored notifications to ensure that administrators and other designated recipients are promptly informed when DLP policies are triggered. This allows for immediate awareness and faster incident response.

  1. **Use Power Automate** to trigger workflows for incident response or user education. Integrate DLP policy matches with automated workflows using Power Automate. This can streamline incident management processes or deliver targeted educational content to users involved in policy violations.

  1. **Include policy tips** to inform users in real time about violations and remediation steps. Enable Policy Tips within Exchange Online so users receive immediate guidance about policy violations and recommended actions to remediate issues. This promotes a culture of compliance and reduces unintentional data exposure.

By combining customized alerts, automated responses, and user-facing guidance, you can create a proactive and integrated incident response framework that supports both compliance and user awareness across your organization.
