The Create a Microsoft Sentinel playbook exercise in this module is an optional unit. However, if you want to perform this exercise, you need access to an Azure subscription where you can create Azure resources. If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?azure-portal=true) before you begin.

To deploy the prerequisites for the exercise, perform the following tasks.

> [!NOTE]
> If you choose to perform the exercise in this module, be aware you might incur costs in your Azure Subscription. To estimate the cost, refer to [Microsoft Sentinel Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/azure-sentinel/).

## Task 2: Check the resources created

1. On the Deployment Overview page, select  **Go to resource group**. The resources for your custom deployment appear.

1. Select **Home** and in **Azure services**, search for and select **Resource groups**.

1. Select **azure-sentinel-rg**.

1. Sort the list of resources by **Type**.

1. The resource group should contain the resources displayed in the following table.

    | `SecurityInsights(<yourName>-Sentinel)` |Solution|Security insights for Microsoft Sentinel. |
    | `st1<xxxxx>` |Storage account|Storage account used by the virtual machine. |
    | `simple-vm` |Virtual machine|Virtual machine (VM) used in the demonstration. |
    | `vnet1` |Virtual network|Virtual network for the VM. |

> [!NOTE]
> The resources deployed and configuration steps completed in this exercise are required in the next exercise. If you intended to complete the next exercise, don't delete the resources from this exercise.

## Task 3: Configure Microsoft Sentinel Connectors

1. In the Azure portal, search for **Microsoft Sentinel**, and then select the previously created Microsoft Sentinel workspace.

1. On the **Microsoft Sentinel | Overview** pane, in the left menu, scroll down to **Content Management** and select **Content Hub**.

1. In the *Content Hub* page, type *Azure Activity* into the *Search* form, and select the **Azure Activity** solution.

1. In the **Azure Activity** solution details pane, select **Install**.

1. In the center *Content name* column, select the **Azure Activity** Data connector.

   > [!NOTE]
   > This solution installs these Content types: 12 Analytic rules, 14 Hunting queries, 1 Workbook, and the Azure Activity Data connector.

1. Select **Open connector page**.

1. In the *Instructions/Configuration* area, scroll down and under *2. Connect your subscriptions...* select **Launch Azure Policy Assignment Wizard**.

1. In the **Basics** tab of the wizard, select the ellipsis ***...*** under **Scope**. On the **Scopes** pane, select your subscription and then select **Select**.

1. Select the **Parameters** tab, and choose your Microsoft Sentinel workspace from the **Primary Log Analytics workspace** drop-down list.

1. Select the **Remediation** tab, and select the **Create a remediation task** checkbox. This action applies the policy assignment to already existing Azure resources.

1. Select the **Review + Create** button to review the configuration, and then select **Create**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The connector for Azure Activity uses policy assignments. You need to have role permissions that allow you to create policy assignments. And, it typically takes 15 minutes to display a status of **Connected**. While the connector deploys, you can continue performing the rest of the steps in this unit and subsequent units in this module.

## Task 4: Create an analytics rule

1. In the Azure portal, search for and select **Microsoft Sentinel**, and then select the previously created Microsoft Sentinel workspace.

1. On the **Microsoft Sentinel** page, on the menu bar, in the **Configuration** section, select **Analytics**.

1. On the **Microsoft Sentinel | Analytics** page, select **Create** and then select **NRT Query Rule (Preview)**.

1. On the **Set rule logic** page, in the **Rule query** section, enter the following query:

    ```kusto
      AzureActivity
      | where OperationNameValue == 'MICROSOFT.COMPUTE/VIRTUALMACHINES/DELETE'
      | where ActivityStatusValue == 'Success'
      | extend AccountCustomEntity = Caller
      | extend IPCustomEntity = CallerIpAddress
    ```

1. Accept the default values for all other settings and then select **Next: Incident setting**.

1. Select **Next: Review**.

1. On the **Review and Create** page, verify that the validation passed, and then select **Create**.
