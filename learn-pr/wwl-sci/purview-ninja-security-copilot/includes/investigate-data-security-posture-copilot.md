**Data Security Posture Management (DSPM)** refers to tools and practices that help organizations discover, monitor, and protect sensitive data across cloud and hybrid environments. These solutions enable efficient data security posture management by identifying risks and ensuring compliance. Using DSPM helps prevent unauthorized access, data breaches, and potential financial or reputational harm. With the integration of Security Copilot, administrators can have deeper investigations and insights into the activity that are taking place in their data real estate. 

Once you've set up DSPM and onboarded your organization to Security Copilot, use the featured promptbooks and prompt gallery to get started. [Promptbooks](/purview/data-security-posture-management-copilot#risky-user-investigation-promptbook) offer built-in prompts that help you quickly understand your data security status.
