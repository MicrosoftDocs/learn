In addition to their unified labeling strategy, the information protection team is looking to use Security Copilot to automate investigations and streamline their review cycles. By integrating Security Copilot with Microsoft Purview, the team can quickly identify, prioritize, and respond to potential data exposures or policy violations across both legacy and newly integrated environments. Automated investigation workflows reduce manual effort, helping the team efficiently triage alerts, uncover root causes, and apply remediation actions where needed.

This automation not only accelerates the review process but also ensures consistency and accuracy in data activities. Security Copilot’s AI-driven insights empower the team to proactively detect risks, summarize alerts, and gain insights before issues escalate. Microsoft Purview consolidates sensitive data management under a single platform. As a result, the corporation saves valuable time and resources, enabling the information protection team to focus on strategic initiatives and maintain a strong security posture throughout the organization’s transformation.
