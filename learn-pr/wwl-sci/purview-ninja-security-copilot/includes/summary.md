Security Copilot streamlines investigations by using intelligent, contextual insights that reduce manual effort for administrators. Its integration with Activity Explorer and Data Security Posture Management (DSPM) enables quick identification and analysis of data security risks. Administrators benefit from built-in and customizable prompts, which allow for targeted investigations with minimal setup, accelerating response times. The platform’s automated triage and transparent alert prioritization help teams efficiently manage and resolve incidents, minimizing alert fatigue. Overall, Security Copilot enhances operational efficiency and supports compliance by providing traceable, auditable processes for addressing threats.

## Key takeaways

- **Automated investigations and efficient triage**: Integrating Security Copilot with Microsoft Purview enables automated investigation workflows, reducing manual effort and accelerating the triage of alerts. This allows teams to quickly identify, prioritize, and respond to data exposures or policy violations while ensuring consistent and accurate data protection.

- **Embedded AI-driven insights**: Security Copilot’s AI capabilities are embedded throughout Microsoft Purview, providing real-time, contextual insights on data loss prevention (DLP) policies, alerts, and activity. Features like the Embedded Skill in the DLP Policy Page and AI-powered triage in Activity Explorer empower teams to efficiently evaluate controls, uncover risks, and take proactive action.

- **Streamlined policy and alert management**: Administrators can use built-in tools to gain immediate visibility into policy scope, triggers, user effect, and alert details. Automated triage and transparent explanations for alert prioritization help reduce alert fatigue and improve both operational efficiency and compliance.

- **Customizable and scalable processes**: Security Copilot agents and promptbooks allow organizations to customize triggers, scope, and investigative prompts. These scalable tools support continuous monitoring, traceable investigations, and compliance across large, complex environments with minimal manual intervention.

- **Enhanced compliance and governance**: The integration supports strong compliance and governance by enabling traceable, auditable investigations. It also ensures that sensitive data is consistently protected across both legacy and new environments. Custom and built-in prompts in DSPM help administrators quickly assess data security posture and respond to threats in alignment with organizational policies.
