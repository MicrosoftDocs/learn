The **Embedded Skill** feature, found directly within the Microsoft Purview interface, streamlines data loss prevention (DLP) policy management by allowing users to easily access advanced insights. To use this capability, select one or more DLP policies and select "Get insights with Copilot." This intuitive action enables administrators to quickly assess policy scope, targeted data types, trigger scenarios, user effect, and notification processes. It's an essential skill for efficient and effective DLP policy oversight.

## Insight capabilities

- **Policy scope**: Shows where policies are searching for sensitive data.
- **Data types**: Identifies what kinds of sensitive information are being targeted.
- **Trigger scenarios**: Explains what actions or conditions activate the policies.
- **User impact**: Details how end users are affected by policy enforcement.
- **Admin notifications**: Describes how and when administrators are alerted.

Using the Embedded Skill in the Microsoft Purview DLP policy page is an excellent initial approach for organizations. It provides immediate, AI-driven insights into the scope, triggers, and effects of their current DLP policies. This empowers teams to efficiently evaluate existing controls, quickly identify gaps or areas for improvement, and strengthen their overall data protection strategy.
