Use Security Copilot to rapidly investigate data loss prevention (DLP) alerts. This enables your team to quickly identify risks, summarize incidents, and streamline response actions. The result is saved time and resources while maintaining consistent and accurate data protection.

- **Accessing the alert**: Investigators can easily locate and open detailed alert views from the DLP Alerts Dashboard.
- **Alert details**: Each alert includes key metadata such as the time of the event, the user involved, the triggered policy, and detected sensitive data types.
- **Content preview**: With the right permissions, investigators can preview the actual content that triggered the alert to determine if the data exposure was intentional or accidental.
- **Matched sensitive content**: The dashboard highlights the specific sensitive information that matched the DLP policy, along with helpful context like surrounding text or file properties.

## Value for investigations

These features are highly beneficial for investigations, as they provide comprehensive visibility into potential data loss incidents. Investigators have immediate access to relevant details and context, enabling faster, more accurate assessments of alert severity and legitimacy. The ability to preview content and see matched sensitive information within the summary helps determine intent and guides appropriate response actions.
