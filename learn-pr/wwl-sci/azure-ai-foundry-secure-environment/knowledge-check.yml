  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "A cloud security engineer needs to control who can create or modify Azure AI Foundry workspaces. Which configuration establishes these permissions?"
    choices:
    - content: "Microsoft Entra ID role-based access control (RBAC)"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct: Microsoft Entra ID RBAC defines Azure resource-level permissions, including who can create, configure, or delete Foundry workspaces."
    - content: "Project-level roles in the Foundry portal"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect: Project roles define in-portal access for collaboration but don't control workspace creation or management."
    - content: "Azure Policy initiatives"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect: Azure Policy enforces configuration standards but doesn't assign permissions."
    - content: "Private Link connections"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect: Private Link restricts network access paths, not resource management permissions."

  - content: "An engineer wants developers to deploy models in a Foundry project but prevent them from modifying resource settings or access assignments. Which role assignment meets this requirement?"
    choices:
    - content: "Contributor"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct: Contributors can deploy and manage models without changing access or role assignments."
    - content: "Owner"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect: The Owner role grants full control, including management of access permissions."
    - content: "Key Vault Administrator"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect: That role applies to Key Vault resources, not Foundry project access."
    - content: "Reader"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect: Readers have view-only permissions and can't deploy or modify resources."

  - content: "To prevent credentials from being stored in code or configuration files, what should the engineering team implement?"
    choices:
    - content: "Private Link connections only"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect: Private Link secures network paths but doesn't handle secret storage."
    - content: "User-assigned access keys in storage accounts"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect: Manually assigned access keys can be exposed and are difficult to manage securely."
    - content: "Custom environment variables in project settings"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect: Environment variables can expose credentials if not protected by Key Vault."
    - content: "Azure Key Vault with managed identities"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct: Key Vault stores secrets securely, and managed identities allow Foundry workloads to retrieve them without embedding credentials."

  - content: "The team wants all traffic between Foundry and connected Azure services to stay on the private Azure backbone. Which approach achieves this?"
    choices:
    - content: "Service endpoints with firewall rules"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect: Service endpoints might still route traffic through public IP space."
    - content: "Managed virtual networks with Private Link"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct: Managed virtual networks define who can access the service, and Private Link keeps communication private within Azure's backbone."
    - content: "Network Security Groups (NSGs) only"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect: NSGs control inbound and outbound rules but don't provide private connectivity."
    - content: "ExpressRoute without private endpoints"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect: ExpressRoute provides connectivity but doesn't isolate Foundry traffic without Private Link."

  - content: "After configuration is complete, the team needs visibility into access events and configuration changes across Foundry and connected resources. What should they enable?"
    choices:
    - content: "Microsoft Sentinel analytic rules"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect: Microsoft Sentinel analyzes log data, but logs must first be collected through diagnostic settings."
    - content: "Diagnostic logging"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct: Diagnostic logging records management actions, access events, and service health data for auditing and investigation."
    - content: "Defender for Cloud AI workloads plan"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect: Defender for Cloud surfaces recommendations but doesn't log detailed operational events."
    - content: "Azure Policy compliance reports"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect: Policy compliance reports show configuration status, not event activity."
