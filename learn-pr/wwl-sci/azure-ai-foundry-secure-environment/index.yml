title: Secure Azure AI Foundry environments
summary: |
  To secure Azure AI Foundry environments requires layered protections that control access, safeguard credentials, isolate network communication, and maintain visibility across connected resources.
  The approach includes defining access boundaries with Microsoft Entra ID and project roles, and integrating Key Vault for secret management. It also uses managed virtual networks, Private Link, and diagnostic logging to maintain privacy, visibility, and compliance.
  These practices create secure, traceable AI environments that support collaboration without compromising protection.
abstract: |
  In this module, you learn to:
  - Define access boundaries using Microsoft Entra ID and role-based access control (RBAC)
  - Manage project-level permissions within shared environments
  - Secure secrets with Key Vault and managed identities
  - Isolate workloads with managed virtual networks and Private Link
  - Enable diagnostic logging for centralized visibility and investigation
prerequisites: |
