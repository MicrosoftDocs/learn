As Azure AI Foundry environments grow, different teams often share access to the same resources, credentials, and data connections. Without defined boundaries, these shared environments can create exposure risks or make it difficult to trace who changed what. Strengthening identity controls, securing connection information, and isolating network communication are essential to keeping AI workloads trustworthy and compliant.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you learn to:

- Define access boundaries using Microsoft Entra ID and role-based access control (RBAC)
- Manage project-level access within shared environments
- Secure secrets with Key Vault and managed identities
- Isolate workloads with virtual networks and Private Link
- Enable diagnostic logging for centralized visibility

## Prerequisites

Before starting, you should have:

- Experience using Azure portal and core services
- Familiarity with Microsoft Entra ID, RBAC, and conditional access
- Basic understanding of network security and log analysis
