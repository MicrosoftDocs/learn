A cloud security engineering team at Contoso Ltd. is preparing to secure a shared Azure AI Foundry workspace that supports several AI development projects. The workspace connects to Azure services such as Storage, Key Vault, and model endpoints.

The team must implement least-privilege access, protect credentials used in model deployments, isolate network traffic between services, and enable diagnostic visibility for auditing and compliance. Their goal is to create a secure, auditable environment that allows multiple project teams to build and deploy AI models safely.
