Protecting shared AI environments in Azure AI Foundry depends on consistent control across identity, secrets, networks, and diagnostics. When these layers work together, every action can be traced, permissions stay aligned with responsibility, and sensitive data remains protected.

In this module, you learned to:

- Control access with Microsoft Entra ID and project roles
- Protect credentials with Key Vault and managed identities
- Isolate traffic through virtual networks and Private Link
- Enable diagnostic logging for ongoing visibility

These practices create a secure and transparent foundation for developing and operating AI workloads, ensuring collaboration happens safely and within clearly defined boundaries.
