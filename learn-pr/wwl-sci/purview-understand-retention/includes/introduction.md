As data moves across Microsoft 365, not all content needs to be treated the same way. Some files need to be preserved for audits or investigations, while others should be deleted once they're no longer useful. Without clear rules, important information might be deleted too early, or sensitive data might remain long after it's needed.

Microsoft Purview retention helps organizations manage content lifespan across mail, files, and messages. It supports operational, regulatory, and security needs by preserving data that matters and removing what doesn't. Knowing when and how to apply retention is key to protecting data and reducing risk.

In this unit, you:

- Identify common scenarios where retention helps protect or manage data
- Compare how retention and data loss prevention support different types of data protection
- Learn how to target retention based on users, locations, or content types
- Recognize what retention does and doesn't control

By the end, you'll understand how to use retention to support data protection and compliance across Microsoft 365.
