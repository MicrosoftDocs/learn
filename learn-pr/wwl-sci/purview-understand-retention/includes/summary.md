Not all content needs to be kept forever. Without retention, sensitive or important information might be deleted too soon, or left behind longer than it should be. In this unit, you explored when to use retention and how to apply it effectively.

You learned how to:

- Identify when retention is appropriate for business, legal, or operational needs
- Understand the difference between retention and data loss prevention, and how they work together
- Apply retention selectively by scoping it to specific users, groups, or content
- Recognize the limitations of retention and what it isn't designed to do

Using retention in Microsoft Purview helps organizations protect key data, reduce exposure to unnecessary content, and meet their regulatory obligations, all without relying on manual oversight or inconsistent decisions. When applied strategically, retention supports a more secure and manageable data environment.
