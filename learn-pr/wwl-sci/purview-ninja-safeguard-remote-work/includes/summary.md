Endpoint data loss prevention (DLP) delivers essential controls and monitoring for safeguarding sensitive data as employees work remotely. By combining policy-based restrictions, real-time monitoring, and adaptive protection, organizations can proactively mitigate data loss risks across diverse devices and environments. Ongoing policy refinement, user education, and diagnostic capabilities ensure robust, resilient data security for a distributed workforce. Integration with solutions like Conditional Access and Defender for Cloud Apps further strengthens protection by enforcing real-time controls and compliance requirements. As remote work continues to evolve, these comprehensive measures help maintain productivity while minimizing the risk of data breaches and compliance violations.

## Key takeaways

- **Comprehensive Endpoint DLP protection**: Endpoint DLP monitors and controls sensitive data transfers on remote worker devices, blocking unauthorized sharing and enforcing security policies to reduce risks such as copying to external drives or unsecured channels.

- **Granular policy assignment and Adaptive Protection**: DLP policies can be assigned to specific user groups or devices, with conditions based on risk levels (such as insider risk indicators). Adaptive protection enables dynamic restriction of high-risk activities for users exhibiting risky behavior, ensuring data loss is contained proactively.

- **Integration with Conditional Access and Defender for Cloud Apps**: By integrating with Conditional Access and Defender for Cloud Apps, organizations can enforce real-time controls on cloud applications. They can block or monitor downloads and uploads of sensitive files. They can also require compliant devices or multifactor authentication for access to critical resources.

- **Always-on diagnostics for efficient troubleshooting**: Enable always‑on diagnostics for Endpoint DLP to capture continuous diagnostic data for up to 90 days, speeding support resolution and improving first‑attempt troubleshooting.
