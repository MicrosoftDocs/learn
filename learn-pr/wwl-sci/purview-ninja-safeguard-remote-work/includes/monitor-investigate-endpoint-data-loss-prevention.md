Effective endpoint data loss prevention (DLP) involves monitoring and responding to incidents using activity explorer and alerts, specifically to safeguard remote data and employees. This approach enables prompt investigation of potential data leaks at endpoints, ensuring that DLP policies are continuously refined based on incident trends. Educating end users includes clear communication of endpoint DLP policies and dedicated training on secure data handling practices. Continuous improvement is achieved by regularly reviewing and updating the policies to adapt to evolving threats targeting remote work environments. Gathering feedback from remote employees and security teams helps refine and strengthen strategies for protecting sensitive information across all endpoints. By following these endpoint DLP best practices, organizations can maintain robust data security while supporting a distributed, remote workforce.

- Monitor endpoint activity and alerts for DLP policy violations to protect remote data and users

- Investigate suspected endpoint data leaks and refine DLP policies as needed

- Communicate endpoint DLP policies and provide secure data training to remote staff

- Regularly update endpoint DLP policies in response to new threats to remote environments

- Solicit feedback from remote employees and security teams to enhance endpoint data protection

Activity explorer has a predefined filter that automatically filters for endpoint DLP activities.

## Enable always-on diagnostics for endpoint DLP

[Always-on diagnostics](/purview/dlp-always-on-diagnostics) provides deeper visibility into endpoint activity by capturing detailed logs over time. Once enabled, Always-on Diagnostics continuously captures comprehensive endpoint DLP diagnostic data for up to 90 days, storing it locally in a highly compressed tamper-proof and proprietary format. When something goes wrong, you already have the complete story. Support tickets resolve faster, no more back-and-forth log collection, and first-attempt diagnostics actually work for endpoints.
