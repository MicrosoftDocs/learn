Organizations need effective strategies to govern AI-generated content in Microsoft 365. As tools like Microsoft 365 Copilot become more widely used, organizations must apply policies that manage how prompts and responses are retained, reviewed, and deleted. In this module, you acted as a compliance administrator responsible for governing AI usage and supporting responsible data practices.

In this module, you learned how to:

- Create retention policies that manage the lifecycle of AI-generated content across Copilot and connected apps
- Use eDiscovery (Premium) to locate and delete AI interactions that require investigation or remediation
- Configure communication compliance policies to detect and review inappropriate or risky prompts and responses

Without these tools, managing AI-generated content would require manual oversight, increasing the risk of data exposure, policy violations, and inconsistent enforcement. As AI continues to shape how people work, governance becomes essential, not optional.

By using Microsoft Purview, you applied structured, scalable policies to govern AI usage in Microsoft 365. Your organization is now better prepared to meet compliance requirements, reduce risk, and manage the growing volume of AI-generated content.
