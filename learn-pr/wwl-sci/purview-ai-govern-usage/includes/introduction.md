Generative AI tools like Microsoft 365 Copilot introduce new types of content that must be governed alongside traditional messages. Prompts and responses generated in apps like Word, Teams, and Outlook might contain sensitive information or violate organizational standards, intentionally or not.

In this module, you take on the role of a compliance administrator responsible for governing AI usage in Microsoft 365. You'll use Microsoft Purview tools to manage the lifecycle of AI-generated content, respond to inappropriate or risky messages, and ensure compliance with your organization's policies.

In this module, you:

- Create and manage retention policies for Copilot and other AI content
- Use eDiscovery (Premium) to identify and delete AI-generated messages during investigations
- Build communication compliance policies that include AI signals and help enforce standards across prompts and responses

By the end of this module, you'll be able to apply governance policies that help control how AI-generated content is retained, reviewed, and removed when necessary.
