There might be scenarios where you need to perform *alert tuning* to suppress alerts from appearing in the portal. You can create alert tuning rules for specific alerts known to be innocuous, such as known tools or processes in your organization.

### View existing rules

You can view a list of all the alert tuning rules and manage them in one place. You can also turn an alert tuning rule on or off by completing these actions:

1. In the Microsoft Defender portal, select **Settings**, select **Microsoft Defender XDR**, and then under Rules select **Alert tuning**. The list of *Alert tuning* rules that users in your organization have created are displayed.

1. Select a rule by selecting the check-box beside the rule name.

1. Select **Turn rule on**, **Edit rule**, or **Delete rule**. When making changes to a rule, you can choose to release alerts that it has already suppressed, regardless of whether or not these alerts match the new criteria.
