## Explore Microsoft Sentinel features in the Defender portal

After you connect your workspace to the Defender portal, **Microsoft Sentinel** is on the left-hand side navigation pane. Pages like  **Overview**, **Incidents**, and **Advanced Hunting** have unified data from Microsoft Sentinel and Defender XDR. For more information about the unified capabilities and differences between portals, see  [Microsoft Sentinel in the Microsoft Defender portal](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2263690).

Many of the existing Microsoft Sentinel features are integrated into the Defender portal. For these features, notice that the experience between Microsoft Sentinel in the Azure portal and Defender portal are similar. Use the following articles to help you start working with Microsoft Sentinel in the Defender portal. When using these articles, keep in mind that your starting point in this context is the [Defender portal](https://security.microsoft.com/) instead of the Azure portal.
