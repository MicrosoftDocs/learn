Now it's time to validate that our Microsoft Sentinel deployment is receiving security events and creating incidents from virtual machines that run Windows.

In this exercise, you learn how to perform a simulated attack to validate that the Analytic and Automation rules create an incident and assign it to the `Operator1`. You perform a `Privilege Escalation` attack on `vm1`.
