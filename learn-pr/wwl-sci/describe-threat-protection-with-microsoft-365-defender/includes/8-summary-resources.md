You wanted to gain a better understanding of how to improve security and access to your organizations assets and data using the Microsoft 365 Defender services. You got a broad understanding of what Microsoft 365 Defender is, and each of the product items: Defender for Identity, Defender for Office 365, and Defender for Endpoint. Finally, you saw how Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps can support access and maintain control of your critical data.

With an increase in demand for cloud services and access, it is more important than ever to maintain strong security. But there comes a balance between strong security and allowing your users to access the data. Without tools like Microsoft Defender for Cloud, you would have to rely on different vendor solutions, which might not integrate fully or could leave gaps.

Now that you've completed this module, you should be able to:

- Describe the Microsoft 365 Defender service.
- Describe how and when to implement Microsoft Defender for Identity.
- Describe how and when to implement Microsoft Defender for Office 365.
- Describe how and when to implement Microsoft Defender for Endpoint.
