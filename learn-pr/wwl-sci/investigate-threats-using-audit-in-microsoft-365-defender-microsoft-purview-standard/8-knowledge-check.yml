  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "As the Enterprise Administrator for Lucerne Publishing, Patti Fernandez wants to give one of Lucerne's users, Allan Deyoung, the minimum level of privileges that will enable Allan to search the Microsoft 365 audit log. What should Patti do?"
    choices:
    - content: "Assign Allan the Microsoft 365 Global Administrator role"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While this role would give Allan permission to run content searches, it's not the minimum level of privileges that Patti should assign to do so."
    - content: "Assign Allan the Search-UnifiedAuditLog role"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Search-UnifiedAuditLog is an Exchange Online PowerShell cmdlet that's used to run a search. It's not a permission role."
    - content: "Assign Allan the View-Only Audit Logs role"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. To search the audit log, administrators and members of investigation teams must be assigned the View-Only Audit Logs or Audit Logs role in Exchange Online."
  - content: "World Wide Importers has finished running a search on its audit log. Allan Deyoung, the company's Enterprise Admin, downloaded the search results in a CSV file and opened it in Excel. Allan noticed that the AuditData column displayed multiple properties that were combined together for each row of data. What feature in Excel's Power Query Editor can Allan use to sort and filter on a specific property in this column?"
    choices:
    - content: "the JSON transform feature"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The AuditData column is a JSON object that contains multiple properties. Allan must use the JSON transform feature in the Power Query Editor in Excel to split each property in the JSON object in the AuditData column into its own column. Allan can then filter columns to view records based on the values of specific properties."
    - content: "the Text/CSV transform feature"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This item isn't the correct feature in the Power Query Editor that Allan can use."
    - content: "the AuditData transform feature"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This item isn't the correct feature in the Power Query Editor that Allan can use."
  - content: "After an audit log search has finished running, the search results are loaded. After a few moments, the results are displayed. How are the search results displayed?"
    choices:
    - content: "All the results will be displayed in increments of 150 events"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This item doesn't correctly describe how the search results are displayed."
    - content: "A maximum of 1500 events will be displayed in increments of 150 events (10 pages worth of events)"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This item doesn't correctly describe how the search results are displayed."
    - content: "A maximum of 50,000 events will be displayed in increments of 150 events"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. A maximum of 50,000 events will be displayed in increments of 150 events. If more than 5000 events meet the search criteria, only the most recent 5000 events are displayed."
