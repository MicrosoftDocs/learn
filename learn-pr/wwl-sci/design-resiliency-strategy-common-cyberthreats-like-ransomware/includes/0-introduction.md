This module covers common cyberthreats, business resiliency, secure backup and restore configurations, and security update management.

Imagine that you work for a medium-sized company that has recently experienced a ransomware attack. The attack has caused significant damage to the company's systems and data, and the company is struggling to recover. As a cybersecurity architect, you've been tasked with designing a comprehensive resiliency strategy that protects against ransomware and other attacks. In this module, you learn how to identify and prioritize threats to business-critical assets, design solutions for business continuity and disaster recovery (BCDR) including secure backup and restore for hybrid and multicloud environments, implement ransomware mitigation strategies with emphasis on privileged access protection, and evaluate solutions for security updates. You'll also discover how AI-powered security operations can accelerate threat detection and response.
