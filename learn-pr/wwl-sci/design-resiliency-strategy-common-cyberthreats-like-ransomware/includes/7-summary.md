In this module, you have learned about common cyber threats like ransomware and how to support business resiliency. You have also learned how to design configurations for secure backup and restore, and how to design solutions for managing security updates. The content in the module helps you prepare for the certification exam SC-100: Microsoft Cybersecurity Architect. Prerequisites for this module include conceptual knowledge of security policies, requirements, zero trust architecture, and management of hybrid environments, as well as working experience with zero trust strategies, applying security policies, and developing security requirements based on business goals.

The main takeaways from this module include understanding the threat landscape and attack vectors, as well as the importance of security breaches and data breaches. You have also learned about attack chain modeling and resilience goals, which focus on supporting the resiliency of your business and limiting the impact and likelihood of disruptions before, during, and after active attacks to business operations. Additionally, you have learned about Azure Backup and how it provides security to your backup environment, both when your data is in transit and at rest.
