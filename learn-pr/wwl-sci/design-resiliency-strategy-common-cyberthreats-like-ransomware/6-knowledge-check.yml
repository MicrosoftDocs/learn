quiz:
    questions:
      - content: "What is the primary method for mitigating against ransomware attacks?"
        choices:
        - content: "Frequently patching systems and applications"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "While keeping systems and applications patched can help prevent certain types of attacks, it isn't the primary method for mitigating ransomware attacks."
        - content: "Monitoring network traffic for indicators of compromise"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "While monitoring network traffic can help identify possible attacks, it isn't the primary method for mitigating ransomware attacks."
        - content: "Backing up data regularly and testing restore procedures"
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Regular backups are essential for restoring any lost or encrypted data after a ransomware attack. Testing restore procedures ensure that the backups can actually perform the desired restore."
        - content: "Enforcing complex password policies for all users"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "While enforcing complex password policies is important for security, it isn't the primary method for mitigating ransomware attacks."
      - content: "What is a critical component of business resiliency planning?"
        choices:
        - content: "Strict adherence to company policies and procedures"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Adhering to policies and procedures is important, but isn't a critical component of business resiliency planning."
        - content: "Performing regular risk assessments"
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Understanding potential risks is key to developing effective resiliency plans. Regular risk assessments help identify these risks and allow for appropriate mitigation strategies to be developed."
        - content: "Establishing clear lines of communication and decision-making authority "
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "While clear lines of communication are important during disruptions, they are not a critical component of business resiliency planning."
        - content: "Frequently performing simulated disaster scenarios"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Simulating disaster scenarios is important, but isn't a critical component of business resiliency planning."
      - content: "How can update management automation help mitigate against security threats?"
        choices:
        - content: "Automating app development to be more secure by design"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "While automating app development can improve security posture, it has little to do with update management automation and mitigating security threats."
        - content: "Ensuring all updates are automatically installed as soon as they become available"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Automatically installing all updates may cause issues if compatibility or other problems arise, so it's not the best approach."
        - content: "Facilitating quicker deployment of critical security patches across infrastructure"
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Update management automation helps quickly deploy critical security patches, reducing the time attackers have to exploit vulnerabilities."
        - content: "Providing detailed log analysis for security events across systems"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "While log analysis is important for detecting and investigating security incidents, it does not relate to update management automation and mitigation techniques."
