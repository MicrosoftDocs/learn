title: Implement and manage retention and recovery in Microsoft Purview
summary: Microsoft Purview helps reduce data exposure by providing tools to control how long content is kept and when itâ€™s permanently deleted. Through retention labels, policies, adaptive scopes, and recovery capabilities, organizations can apply consistent lifecycle rules across Microsoft 365 and reduce the risk of keeping unnecessary or outdated data. This approach supports both compliance and information security goals by minimizing what data is available to unauthorized access or misuse.
