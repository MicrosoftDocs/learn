title: Implement and manage Microsoft 365 retention and recovery
summary: Microsoft Purview provides tools to manage how long content is retained and when it's deleted across Microsoft 365 services. These retention settings apply lifecycle rules using labels, policies, and adaptive scopes. When content is deleted, recovery options are managed within the individual services, such as SharePoint and Exchange. Together, these tools support compliance and information security by reducing the risk of retaining unnecessary or outdated data.
