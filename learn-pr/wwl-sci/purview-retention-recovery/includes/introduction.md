Effective retention and recovery strategies help protect sensitive information, support regulatory compliance, and ensure operational resilience. As organizations generate more data across Microsoft 365, it's important to manage the entire content lifecycleâ€”from creation to deletion, and even recovery after accidental loss.

Microsoft Purview supports this by offering tools to apply retention at both the container and item level. It also lets you define when data should be deleted and restore access when content is removed or changed. Security teams can use retention labels, policies, and recovery tools to enforce data governance requirements and reduce the risk of data loss or oversharing.
