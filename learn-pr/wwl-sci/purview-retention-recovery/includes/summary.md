Data governance depends on the ability to retain information for the right amount of time and recover it when needed. Without clear policies and tools in place, organizations risk losing important data, violating compliance requirements, or retaining content longer than necessary.

Microsoft Purview enables security teams to implement flexible and scalable retention strategies using labels, policies, and scopes. It also provides recovery options that allow users and administrators to restore deleted items, revert to earlier versions, and ensure business continuity.

In this module you learned to:

- Plan retention and disposition settings for different types of content.
- Create and apply retention labels manually or automatically.
- Use adaptive scopes to apply retention policies at scale.
- Configure policies to retain, delete, or both, based on business or regulatory needs.
- Understand how retention precedence works when multiple settings apply.
- Recover deleted or changed content across Microsoft 365 workloads.

Applying the right retention and recovery tools helps organizations reduce risk, support compliance, and maintain control over data across the Microsoft 365 ecosystem.
