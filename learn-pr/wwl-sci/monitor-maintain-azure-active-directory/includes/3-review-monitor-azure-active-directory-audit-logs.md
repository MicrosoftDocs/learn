## Audit logs shortcuts

In addition to **Microsoft Entra ID**, the Azure portal provides you with two additional entry points to audit data:

### Users and groups audit logs

With user and group-based audit reports, you can get answers to questions such as:

 - What types of updates have been applied to users?
 - How many users were changed?
 - How many passwords were changed?
 - What has an administrator done in a directory?
 - What are the groups that have been added?
 - Are there groups with membership changes?
 - Have the owners of a group been changed?

If you want to review only auditing data that is related to users, you can find a filtered view under **Audit logs** in the **Monitoring** section of the **Users** tab. This entry point has **UserManagement** as preselected category.

## Microsoft 365 activity logs

You can view Microsoft 365 activity logs from the Microsoft 365 admin center. Even though Microsoft 365 activity and Microsoft Entra activity logs share a lot of the directory resources, only the Microsoft 365 admin center provides a full view of the Microsoft 365 activity logs. You can also access the Microsoft 365 activity logs programmatically by using the Office 365 Management APIs.
