AI tools introduce new challenges for protecting sensitive data. Information might be accessed without the right protections in place, shared too broadly, or exposed through risky user behavior. Traditional security controls often lack the visibility or flexibility to manage these risks effectively.

Microsoft Purview includes tools that help security teams identify, evaluate, and respond to AI-related risks. Data assessments in Data Security Posture Management for AI (DSPM) for AI detect oversharing issues in SharePoint and OneDrive. Insider Risk Management policies detect risky AI activity, such as sensitive prompts or browsing to generative AI sites. Adaptive Protection uses those insights to apply different enforcement actions based on each userâ€™s risk level.

These capabilities work together to strengthen data protection in environments where AI tools are actively used.

## Learning objectives

By the end of this module, you'll be able to:

- Detect oversharing risks with data assessments in DSPM for AI
- Use Insider Risk Management to identify risky AI usage
- Apply adaptive protection based on user risk levels to enforce DLP policies
