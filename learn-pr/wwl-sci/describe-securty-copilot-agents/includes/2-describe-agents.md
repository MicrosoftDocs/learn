Microsoft Security Copilot provides a range of agents designed to enhance security workflows and streamline operations. These agents assist security engineers by automating tasks, providing insights, and integrating with other Microsoft security tools.

## Define agents in Microsoft Security Copilot
Agents in Microsoft Security Copilot are specialized tools that help automate and optimize security operations. They are designed to perform specific tasks, such as analyzing threats, triaging phishing incidents, or optimizing conditional access policies. Agents consist of predefined workflows and capabilities tailored to address particular security challenges.

- Agents can be accessed through the standalone experience or embedded within portals.
- They simplify complex security tasks, enabling faster and more efficient responses.

> Agents are available in both Microsoft and partner versions, offering flexibility based on organizational needs.

## Identify key agents in Microsoft Security Copilot
Microsoft Security Copilot includes several key agents that address specific security scenarios:

- **Conditional Access Optimization Agent**: Monitors new users or apps not covered by existing policies, identifies security gaps, and recommends fixes for identity teams.
- **Phishing Triage Agent**: Scales security teams' response to phishing incidents by automating triage and classification.
- **Threat Intelligence Briefing Agent**: Curates relevant threat intelligence based on an organization's attributes and exposure.

Partner agents, such as the Network Supervisor Agent and Privacy Breach Response Agent, extend functionality by addressing network issues and privacy compliance.

## Explain agent triggers and permissions
Agents are triggered based on predefined workflows or user actions. Permissions play a critical role in controlling access to agents and their capabilities. Security engineers must ensure that agents have appropriate permissions to access data and perform tasks securely.

- Permissions are managed within the Microsoft Security Copilot environment.
- Proper configuration ensures agents operate within the scope of organizational policies.

## Summarize agent integration with Microsoft Defender and Entra
Agents integrate seamlessly with Microsoft Defender and Microsoft Entra to enhance identity and threat management tasks. For example:

- The Phishing Triage Agent works within Microsoft Defender to streamline phishing response.
- The Conditional Access Optimization Agent operates in Microsoft Entra to improve identity security.

These integrations enable a unified approach to managing security across platforms.

## Describe plugins and their role in extending agent capabilities
Plugins enhance agent functionality by providing access to additional services and data sources. They allow agents to connect with external systems, expanding their ability to analyze data and generate insights.

- Plugins are configurable and can be tailored to meet specific organizational requirements.
- They ensure agents remain adaptable to evolving security needs.
