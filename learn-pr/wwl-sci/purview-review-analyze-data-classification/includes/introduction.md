Organizations store and share sensitive data across cloud services, collaboration platforms, and on-premises environments. As data moves across multiple systems, security teams face challenges in ensuring proper classification, protection, and policy enforcement. To address these challenges, organizations need visibility into where sensitive data resides, how it's labeled, and how it's accessed. Without it, they struggle to enforce security policies, increasing the risk of data leaks, compliance violations, and unauthorized access.

Microsoft Purview provides tools that help security and compliance teams track classified data, enforce protection policies, and detect potential risks. Information Protection Reports, Data explorer, Content explorer, and Activity explorer provide real-time insights into data security, enabling organizations to monitor labeling adoption, investigate policy effectiveness, and analyze user activity trends.

By using these tools, organizations can:

- Track data classification and protection across Microsoft 365, Azure, Amazon Web Services (AWS), and on-premises storage.
- Analyze label usage and policy compliance to ensure sensitive information is properly secured.
- Investigate user interactions with classified content to detect unauthorized access or policy violations.
- Apply AI-driven insights through Microsoft Security Copilot to identify risks and refine security strategies.

## Learning objectives

By the end of this module, you'll be able to:

- Interpret Information Protection Reports to assess classification and protection trends.
- Investigate labeled content using Data explorer and Content explorer to identify classification patterns.
- Analyze user activity in Activity explorer to detect policy violations and potential security risks.

Use this knowledge to improve data security, maintain compliance, and respond to risks with confidence.
