Without clear visibility into how sensitive data is classified, accessed, and protected, organizations struggle to enforce security policies and prevent unauthorized data exposure. Data security threats, such as accidental data leaks, insider risks, and compliance violations, can lead to financial loss, regulatory penalties, and operational disruptions.

This module covered how Microsoft Purview helps organizations overcome these challenges by providing tools to monitor classification trends, track policy compliance, and investigate security risks.

Using Information Protection Reports, Data explorer, Content explorer, and Activity explorer, organizations can:

- Interpret classification and protection trends to assess labeling adoption.
- Investigate labeled content to ensure sensitive data is classified appropriately.
- Analyze user activity to detect policy violations and security risks.

Maintaining data security requires continuous monitoring and policy adjustments. Microsoft Purview gives security teams the tools to track classification trends, analyze risks, and respond to potential threats, ensuring sensitive data remains protected while enabling safe collaboration.
