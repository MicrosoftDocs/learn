Microsoft Entra self-service password reset (SSPR) gives users the ability to change or reset their password, with no administrator or helpdesk involvement. If a user's account is locked or they forget their password, they can follow prompts to unblock themselves and get back to work. This ability reduces help desk calls and loss of productivity when a user can't sign in to their device or an application.

## Benefits of self-service password reset

There are many benefits for the user and the organization to enabling self-service password reset:

 - Users can reset their own password - no productivity loss
 - No admin or IT intervention - enables IT to focus on bigger issues

Licensing requirements:

 - Cloud based accounts - A user has to be enrolled into self-service password reset, and that a Microsoft Entra ID Premium P1 or P2 license or a Microsoft 365 Business Standard license is required.
 - On-premises accounts - A user has to be enrolled into self-service password reset, and that a Microsoft Entra ID Premium P1 or P2 license or a Microsoft 365 Business Premium license.
