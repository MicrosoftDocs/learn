One of the main features of an identity platform is to verify, or authenticate, credentials when a user signs in to a device, application, or service. In Microsoft Entra ID, authentication involves more than just verifying a username and password. To improve security and reduce the need for help desk assistance, Microsoft Entra authentication includes the following components:

 - Self-service password reset
 - Multifactor authentication
 - Hybrid integration to write password changes back to on-premises environment
 - Hybrid integration to enforce password protection policies for an on-premises environment
 - Passwordless authentication
 - Authentication to virtual machines

This module examines these components and explains how to plan, implement, and manage user authentication in Microsoft Entra ID.
