Contoso Ltd. is developing an internal assistant that uses **Azure OpenAI** for natural language responses and **Azure AI Search** to retrieve company data. The workload runs on Azure infrastructure managed by the security team, which maintains network isolation, access control, and **Defender for Cloud** posture policies.

As deployment approaches, the cloud security engineer must evaluate how to extend existing protections to cover data handling, model behavior, and workload posture across the AI lifecycle.
