Effective management of an organization’s network security perimeter requires the right combination of tools and systems. Microsoft Sentinel is a scalable, cloud-native SIEM/SOAR solution that delivers intelligent security analytics and threat intelligence across the enterprise. It provides a single solution for alert detection, threat visibility, proactive hunting, and threat response.

This diagram shows the end-to-end functionality of Microsoft Sentinel.

- **Collect** data at cloud scale across all users, devices, applications, and infrastructure, both on-premises and in multiple clouds.
- **Detect** previously uncovered threats and minimize false positives using analytics and unparalleled threat intelligence.
- **Investigate** threats with artificial intelligence (AI) and hunt suspicious activities at scale, tapping into decades of cybersecurity work at Microsoft.
- **Respond** to incidents rapidly with built-in orchestration and automation of common security tasks.

Microsoft Sentinel helps enable end-to-end security operations, in a modern Security Operations Center (SOC). Listed below are some of the key features of Microsoft Sentinel.

### Connect Sentinel to your data

To on-board Microsoft Sentinel, you first need to connect to your security sources. Microsoft Sentinel comes with many connectors for Microsoft solutions, available out of the box and providing real-time integration. Included are Microsoft Defender XDR solutions, and Microsoft 365 sources, including Office 365, Microsoft Entra, and more.  In addition, there are built-in connectors to the broader security ecosystem of non-Microsoft solutions. You can also connect your data sources using community-built data connectors listed in the Microsoft Sentinel GitHub repository or by following generic deployment procedures for how to connect your data source to Microsoft Sentinel. Links to information are included in the Learn more section of the summary and resources unit.

### Workbooks

After you connect data sources to Microsoft Sentinel, you can monitor the data using the Microsoft Sentinel integration with Azure Monitor Workbooks. Workbooks are intended for SOC engineers and analysts of all tiers to visualize data. You'll see a canvas for data analysis and the creation of rich visual reports within the Azure portal. 

Through this integration, Microsoft Sentinel allows you to create custom workbooks across your data. It also comes with built-in workbook templates that allow quick insights across your data as soon as you connect a data source.

### Analytics

Microsoft Sentinel uses analytics to correlate alerts into incidents. Incidents are groups of related alerts that together create an actionable possible-threat that you can investigate and resolve. With analytics in Microsoft Sentinel, you can use the built-in correlation rules as-is, or use them as a starting point to build your own. Microsoft Sentinel also provides machine learning rules to map your network behavior and then look for anomalies across your resources. These analytics connect the dots, by combining low fidelity alerts about different entities into potential high-fidelity security incidents.

### Manage incidents in Microsoft Sentinel

Incident management allows you to manage the lifecycle of the incident.  View all related alerts that are aggregated into an incident. You can also triage and investigate.  Review all related entities in the incident and additional contextual information meaningful to the triage process. Investigate the alerts and related entities to understand the scope of breach. Trigger playbooks on the alerts grouped in the incident to resolve the threat detected by the alert. You can also do standard incident management tasks like changing status or assigning incidents to individuals for investigation.

### Security automation and orchestration with playbooks

You can use Microsoft Sentinel to automate some of your security operations and make your security operations center (SOC) more productive. Microsoft Sentinel integrates with Azure Logic Apps, so you can create automated workflows, or playbooks, in response to events. A security playbook is a collection of procedures that can help SOC engineers and analysts of all tiers to automate and simplify tasks and orchestrate a response.  Playbooks work best with single, repeatable tasks, and require no coding knowledge.

### Investigation

Microsoft Sentinel's deep investigation tools help you to understand the scope of a potential security threat and find the root cause. You choose an entity on the interactive graph to ask specific questions, then drill down into that entity and its connections to get to the root cause of the threat.

### Hunting

Use Microsoft Sentinel's powerful hunting search-and-query tools, based on the MITRE framework (a global database of adversary tactics and techniques), to proactively hunt for security threats across your organization’s data sources, before an alert is triggered. After you discover which hunting query provides high-value insights into possible attacks, you can also create custom detection rules based on your query, and surface those insights as alerts to your security incident responders.

While hunting, you can bookmark interesting events. Bookmarking events enables you to return to them later, share them with others, and group them with other correlating events to create a compelling incident for investigation.

### Notebooks

Microsoft Sentinel supports Jupyter notebooks.  Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text. You can use Jupyter notebooks in Microsoft Sentinel to extend the scope of what you can do with Microsoft Sentinel data. For example, perform analytics that aren't built in to Microsoft Sentinel, such as some Python machine learning features, create data visualizations that aren't built in to Microsoft Sentinel, such as custom timelines and process trees, or integrate data sources outside of Microsoft Sentinel, such as an on-premises data set.

### Community

The Microsoft Sentinel community is a powerful resource for threat detection and automation. Microsoft security analysts constantly create and add new workbooks, playbooks, hunting queries, and more, posting them to the community for you to use in your environment. You can download sample content from the private community GitHub repository to create custom workbooks, hunting queries, notebooks, and playbooks for Microsoft Sentinel.

### Content hub

The Microsoft Sentinel Content hub is your centralized location to discover and manage out-of-the-box (built-in) packaged solutions.  Microsoft Sentinel solutions are packages of Microsoft Sentinel content or Microsoft Sentinel API integrations that provide single-step deployment and enablement.  Content hub solutions, which fulfill an end-to-end product, domain, or industry vertical scenario in Microsoft Sentinel.

In the Content hub, filter by categories and other parameters to find the content that works best for your organization's needs and use cases. The Content hub also indicates the support model applied to each solution and content, as some content is maintained by Microsoft and others are maintained by partners or the community. You can also manage updates for out-of-the-box content via the Microsoft Sentinel Content hub.
