Access reviews can be set to occur on a recurring basis. Name your Access Review, select a start date, frequency, duration, end date, and you're ready to go. Reviewers will be notified at the start of each review. Reviewers can approve or deny access with a friendly interface and with the help of smart recommendations.

Why are recurring access review important? Because of lifecycle management. Everything that starts, needs to have an end date. Between the start and end, we need to ensure permissions are what we need them to be. Not too much, not too little. And we regularly ask an owner if everything is still what they want it to be. With recurrence we make sure this checking will be done regularly.
