Handling privacy rights requests can be overwhelming for organizations, especially when data is spread across multiple systems. Searching for, managing, and responding to requests manually increases the risk of errors and non-compliance. Microsoft Priva Subject Rights Requests simplifies this process by helping organizations locate personal data, track progress, and respond to requests efficiently and securely.

This module showed how subject rights requests makes it easier to handle requests for data in Microsoft 365 and other environments like multicloud platforms and on-premises systems. With tools for automatic data discovery, customized workflows, and collaboration, Priva helps organizations save time, stay compliant, and respond to requests with confidence.

In this module, you learned to:

- Understand how subject rights requests help with privacy management.
- Set up and manage subject rights requests using templates or custom configurations.
- Use Microsoft Priva to respond to requests for data stored both in Microsoft 365 and other environments.

Without Microsoft Priva Subject Rights Requests, organizations might rely on slow and inconsistent manual processes, putting them at greater risk of non-compliance. Priva helps automate the process, improves accuracy, and makes it easier to meet privacy requirements.
