Organizations that rely on manual processes for privacy rights requests face delays, missed deadlines, and higher risk of errors. This module showed how Microsoft Priva Subject Rights Requests address those challenges by giving you a consistent way to locate data in Microsoft 365, decide what to include, and generate reports and audit logs to support compliance.

In this module, you learned to:

- Understand the purpose of subject rights requests.
- Create requests using templates or custom settings.
- Review collected data by including, excluding, or redacting items.
- Complete the process by generating reports and closing requests.

By applying these steps, the challenge of fragmented and manual responses is replaced with a structured workflow that ensures accurate, timely, and defensible outcomes.
