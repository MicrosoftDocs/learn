After you finish reviewing collected data, the last step is to generate reports and close the request. Reports document what was included or excluded, provide the package for the data subject, and keep internal records for compliance.

## Generate reports

When you select **Complete review**, Priva starts report generation automatically. Reports appear on the **Reports** tab:

- **Reports for the data subject**: contain the package of items marked **Include**. This applies to Access and Export requests.
- **Reports for internal use**: contain the audit log, along with lists of items tagged for follow-up or other internal actions.

Generation time varies based on volume. Use the **Status** column to see when reports are ready to download.

## Data packages

The data package is delivered as a zip file containing the items you marked as **Include**. Items that were redacted appear in their redacted form, while originals remain unchanged. Packages might also contain summary files that help correlate file names and review decisions.

Before sending, review the contents carefully and remove anything that doesn’t belong. Provide only what’s necessary to fulfill the request.

## Audit and retention

Every request includes an audit log showing who completed each step and when. Reports and related data are retained for a set period, usually 30 days, though organizations can adjust retention settings to 90 days. Make sure the retention period aligns with your compliance policies.

## Close the request

When reporting is complete and the response has been provided securely to the data subject, select **Close the request**. Closing marks the request as complete and prevents further edits, while reports remain available until the retention period expires.
