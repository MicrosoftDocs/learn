Organizations must be able to respond to privacy rights requests as more individuals request access to, correct, or delete their personal data. Meeting these demands manually can be overwhelming, especially when data is stored across multiple systems and platforms. Failure to address requests efficiently can lead to compliance risks, customer dissatisfaction, and loss of trust.

With Microsoft Priva Subject Rights Requests, organizations can simplify and automate the process of managing privacy rights requests. The tool enables teams to locate personal data across systems, track request progress, and safeguard sensitive information while meeting regulatory deadlines and organizational policies.

## Scenario

Your company, a mid-sized financial institution, recently received an influx of requests from customers asking for copies of their data. Handling these requests has been time-consuming, with multiple departments manually searching records and struggling to respond within regulatory timeframes. The current process leaves room for errors, creating potential compliance risks.

A solution is needed to automate data searches, streamline request management, and ensure that responses are accurate, timely, and compliant with privacy regulations.
