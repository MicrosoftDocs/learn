Organizations must be able to respond to privacy rights requests as individuals ask to access or delete their personal data. Handling these requests manually can be overwhelming, especially when information is stored across multiple systems. Delays or errors create compliance risks and reduce customer trust.

For example, a company receiving multiple requests across departments could struggle to coordinate searches and meet deadlines without a structured tool. Microsoft Priva Subject Rights Requests provide that structure by locating personal data in Microsoft 365, tracking progress, and producing accurate, auditable responses.

### Learning objectives

By the end of this module, you'll be able to:

- Explain the role of subject rights requests in privacy management.
- Create and manage subject rights requests in Microsoft Priva.
- Review and complete requests to produce accurate responses and audit records.
