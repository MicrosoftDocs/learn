When a request reaches the review stage, the collected data is rarely neat. Messages, forms, and shared project files might all appear together, even if only some are relevant. The review step provides structure: decide what to include, exclude unrelated or non-Microsoft information, and record choices so the final package is accurate and defensible.

Before you begin, make a quick plan. Start with any priority items, apply filters to narrow the list, and preview files so you're not reviewing content at random.

## Plan the review

Open the request and go to **Data collected**. Prioritize any items flagged for potential conflicts, apply filters such as **Keywords**, **Tags**, or **Location** to focus the work, and preview files before deciding. If a file doesn't render, you can download it. Keep an eye out for duplicates by name, size, or version to avoid reviewing the same content twice.

## Decide what belongs in the response

Give each item a clear status so the output is accurate:

- **Include**: the item is relevant to the data subject and should be returned.
- **Exclude**: the item isn't relevant. Add a short note to record why.
- **Not a match**: the item was returned by search but doesn't relate to the request.

Only items marked **Include** are packaged for the final response. If you mark an item for deletion but it has a retention setting, record the conflict. Retention takes precedence, and the deletion will be blocked later.

## Use tags and notes to organize work

Tags and notes help reviewers coordinate without extra spreadsheets:

- **Tags**: apply tags like _Follow-up_ or _Update_ to group items for a second review or specialist input.
- **Notes**: capture reviewer context or rationale. Notes are internal and aren't shared with the data subject.

You can apply tags and notes to single items or to a selection.

## Redact sensitive or unrelated content

Before finalizing, remove content that shouldn't be shared. Use the **Redact** tools to block specific text or regions. Redaction creates a separate version for the package and leaves the original file unchanged. Keep redactions targeted, removing only information that's unrelated to the request or belongs to other individuals. Always confirm redactions in the export preview to make sure they appear as expected.

## Import files when needed

If relevant items live outside the collected locations, use **Import files** so they appear with the rest of the content. This keeps review and packaging in one place.

## Collaborate with the right people

Subject rights requests often involve multiple reviewers. Use a private Teams channel to coordinate discussion and decisions, and add collaborators who need to review or provide input. They'll see the same items and status. For delete requests, assign an approver since items marked for deletion must be approved before any action occurs.

## Complete the review

When decisions are recorded and redactions are complete:

1. Select **Complete review**.
1. Confirm the summary and save any final notes for internal records.

The request is now ready for the next stage: generating reports and, if applicable, processing deletions.

## What happens next

- **Access or export**: generate the final package and retain audit logs.
- **Tagged list for follow-up**: share internally so teams can act.
- **Delete**: approved items proceed to deletion. Retention policies are respected, and blocked items are listed in reports.
