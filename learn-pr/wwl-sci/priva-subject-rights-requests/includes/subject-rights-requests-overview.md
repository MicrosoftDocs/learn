As organizations increasingly manage privacy-related requests, having a streamlined and effective process is essential. Microsoft Priva provides a solution through subject rights requests, which help organizations address regulatory requirements and privacy concerns by enabling efficient data discovery, classification, and request management.

Subject rights requests allow you to locate and act on personal data stored in your organization's systems, whether within Microsoft 365 or across multicloud and on-premises environments. These requests are categorized into two types:

- **Requests for data within Microsoft 365**: Focus on personal data stored in Microsoft 365 services, including Exchange Online, SharePoint, OneDrive, and Teams.
- **Requests for data beyond Microsoft 365 (preview)**: Extend capabilities to include data stored across multicloud platforms, such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google Cloud, and on-premises systems.

## Requests for data within Microsoft 365

Requests for data within Microsoft 365 enable organizations to manage privacy requests for data stored in Microsoft's ecosystem. These requests use built-in integrations with Microsoft services to automate data discovery and streamline compliance processes.

Key features include:

- **Automated data discovery**: Priva identifies and retrieves personal data stored in services like Exchange Online, SharePoint, OneDrive, and Teams.
- **Efficient workflows**: Requests automatically prioritize content containing sensitive information or involving multiple individuals, ensuring teams focus on the most critical items.
- **Integrated tools**: Redaction, tagging, and collaboration features (such as dedicated Microsoft Teams channels) help teams review and manage data efficiently.

This type of request simplifies the process for managing privacy-related requests for data within the Microsoft 365 environment, ensuring compliance with minimal manual effort.

## Requests for data beyond Microsoft 365 (preview)

Requests for data beyond Microsoft 365 expand Priva's capabilities to include personal data stored in multicloud and on-premises environments. This feature is powered by the Microsoft Purview Data Map, which provides a unified view of your organization's data estate.

Key features include:

- **Comprehensive data discovery**: The Data Map continuously discovers and organizes personal data across Azure, AWS, Google Cloud, and on-premises systems.
- **Customizable workflows**: Organizations can tailor workflows to analyze and process data classifications, ensuring privacy requests are fulfilled accurately and efficiently.
- **Automation and scalability**: The feature scales to accommodate diverse data sources and enables automated task assignment to data owners.

The Microsoft Purview Data Map plays a critical role in enabling these requests. By categorizing, labeling, and integrating data workflows, the Data Map ensures efficient privacy management across your entire data landscape. It enables:

- **Data discovery:** Automatically identifies data across multicloud and on-premises systems.
- **Data classification:** Categorizes and labels data for easier tracking and management.
- **Workflow integration:** Connects seamlessly with subject rights requests to streamline the process of finding and retrieving personal data.
