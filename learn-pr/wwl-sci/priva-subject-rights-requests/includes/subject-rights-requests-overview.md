Responding to privacy rights requests can be challenging for organizations. Manually searching for a person's data across multiple services is time-consuming, and inconsistent processes increase the risk of errors or missed deadlines. These issues raise compliance risks and can damage customer trust.

Microsoft Priva Subject Rights Requests simplify and automate this process for data stored in Microsoft 365. With built-in integrations, subject rights requests help organizations locate personal data, organize it for review, and deliver accurate responses on time.

## Subject rights requests in Microsoft 365

Subject rights requests focus on personal data stored in Microsoft 365 services, including Exchange Online, SharePoint, OneDrive, and Teams. With these integrations, Priva enables organizations to:

- **Discover personal data automatically**: Retrieve data across mail, chat, files, and collaboration tools.  
- **Streamline workflows**: Prioritize sensitive content or items involving multiple people so reviewers can focus on the most important data.  
- **Enable collaboration**: Create dedicated Teams channels for each request to coordinate reviews and decisions.  
- **Support compliance tasks**: Apply redaction, tagging, and reporting features to ensure responses meet regulatory requirements.

## Why this matters

Imagine a financial services company that receives multiple requests from customers to see or delete their data. Without a structured tool, staff from different departments must manually search systems, compile results, and check for sensitive information. This can lead to missed deadlines or exposure of irrelevant data. With Subject Rights Requests, the company can automate discovery across Microsoft 365, collaborate in one workspace, and ensure customers receive accurate, timely responses.

## How to access subject rights requests
