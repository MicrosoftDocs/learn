title: Configure and manage guardrails in Azure AI Foundry 
summary: |
  Azure AI Foundry guardrails help secure AI workloads by applying configurable safety controls that evaluate both prompts and responses.
  You'll learn how to understand built-in safety models, test and refine guardrails, create blocklists, configure content filters, and validate that protections work as intended.
  These capabilities help organizations prevent unsafe or policy-violating interactions, protect sensitive data, and maintain trust in AI-assisted applications.
