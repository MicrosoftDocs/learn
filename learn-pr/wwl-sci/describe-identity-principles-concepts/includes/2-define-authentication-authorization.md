### Authentication
Authentication is the process of proving that a person is who they say they are. When someone purchases an item with a credit card, they might be required to show another form of identification. This proves that they are the person whose name appears on the card. In this example, the user might show a driver’s license that serves as a form of authentication and proves their ID.

When you want to access a computer or device, you encounter a similar type of authentication. You might get asked to enter a username and password. The username states who you are, but by itself isn't enough to grant you access. When combined with the password, which only that user should know, it allows access to your systems. The username and password, together, are a form of authentication. Authentication is sometimes shortened to AuthN.

### Authorization
Once you authenticate a user, you need to decide where they can go, and what they're allowed to see and touch. This process is called authorization.

Suppose you want to spend the night in a hotel. The first thing you do is go to reception to start the "authentication process." After the receptionist has verified who you are, you're given a keycard and can go to your room. Think of the keycard as the authorization process. The keycard lets you open only the doors and elevators you're permitted to access, such as for your hotel room.

In cybersecurity terms, authorization determines the level of access or the permissions an authenticated person has to your data and resources. Authorization is sometimes shortened to AuthZ.

### Multifactor authentication (MFA) and passwordless
Using a username and password is a common way to authenticate, but passwords are a frequent target for attackers.

**Multifactor authentication (MFA)** strengthens authentication by requiring more than one proof, such as:

- Something you know (password or PIN)
- Something you have (phone, security key)
- Something you are (biometrics)

**Passwordless** authentication reduces reliance on passwords by using stronger alternatives (for example, passkeys or Windows Hello for Business). Many passwordless methods are **phishing-resistant**, meaning they help protect users even if they're tricked into visiting a fake sign-in page.
