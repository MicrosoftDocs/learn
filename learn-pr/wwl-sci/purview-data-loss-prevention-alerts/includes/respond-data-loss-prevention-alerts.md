After you've investigated a data loss prevention (DLP) alert, the next step is to respond appropriately. This includes documenting your findings, assigning ownership if needed, taking mitigation actions, and closing out the alert or incident. Microsoft Purview and Microsoft Defender XDR offer different, but complementary, capabilities to support this response process.

## Response actions in Microsoft Purview

In Microsoft Purview, you respond to DLP alerts directly from the **Alerts dashboard**. These alerts are typically scoped to user actions that match a DLP policy.

Key actions include:

- **Set alert status** to track progress, such as Investigating or Resolved
- **Assign the alert** to a reviewer for accountability
- **Add comments** to capture internal notes or observations
- **Share alert details** using a generated read-only link
- **View user activity summary** (if Insider Risk Management is integrated)

These steps help ensure alerts are handled consistently and that important context is recorded for future audits or follow-ups.

## Response actions in Microsoft Defender XDR

In Microsoft Defender XDR, alerts are grouped into incidents, giving analysts a broader view of correlated activity across endpoints, email, cloud apps, and identities.

From the incident and alert views, you can:

- **Update the incident status**, assign it to a team member, and add notes
- **Apply classifications** like **True Positive** or **False Positive** and specify a reason
- **Take remediation actions** directly, such as:
  - Disabling a user account
  - Removing file access
  - Applying a sensitivity or retention label

You can also **correlate the DLP alert** with other security signals to determine whether it's part of a larger threat or an isolated incident.

Responding to alerts isn't just about closing them out; it's about creating accountability and ensuring that potential data risks are addressed. Whether you're resolving a low-risk policy match or escalating a broader insider threat, clearly documented responses support organizational compliance and reduce the likelihood of repeated incidents.
