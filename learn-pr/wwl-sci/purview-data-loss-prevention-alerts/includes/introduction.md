Investigating and responding to data loss prevention (DLP) alerts is an essential part of protecting sensitive information across your organization. DLP policies are designed to detect risky actions, but detecting those actions is only the beginning. To manage risks effectively, it's important to investigate alerts thoroughly, understand what triggered them, and take appropriate action based on your findings.

Imagine you're responsible for protecting sensitive financial data. When an alert is triggered, you need to determine whether it was caused by an accidental action, a potential policy gap, or a sign of something more serious. Knowing how to investigate alerts in Microsoft Purview and Microsoft Defender XDR helps you build a complete picture of what happened. Responding appropriately ensures that risks are addressed, documentation is clear, and policies continue to improve over time.

In this module, you:

- Understand how DLP alerts are triggered and where they appear
- Identify how DLP alerts are triggered and where they appear
- Investigate alerts in Microsoft Purview and Microsoft Defender XDR
- Apply appropriate response actions based on investigation outcomes
- Complete the investigation process by documenting findings, assigning ownership, and closing alerts or incidents
- Recognize opportunities to improve DLP policies based on investigation outcomes

By the end of this module, you'll be able to investigate DLP alerts, respond effectively to different types of incidents, and use investigation outcomes to support continuous improvement.
