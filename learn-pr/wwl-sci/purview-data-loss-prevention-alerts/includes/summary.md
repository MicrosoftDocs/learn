Investigating and responding to data loss prevention (DLP) alerts helps organizations identify potential risks early and take action to protect sensitive information. In this module, you learned how to review alerts, gather context, apply remediation actions, and document your findings in a structured and consistent way.

You learned to:

- Investigate DLP alerts in Microsoft Purview and Microsoft Defender XDR
- Review alert details, related user activities, and matched events
- Take appropriate response actions, such as revoking access, disabling accounts, or updating alert statuses
- Assign ownership, document decisions, and support accountability throughout the investigation process

Without a structured investigation and response process, small issues could be missed or handled inconsistently, increasing the risk of data exposure. By using Microsoft Purview and Microsoft Defender XDR together, you can ensure that alerts are investigated thoroughly, actions are documented clearly, and risks are addressed before they escalate. A strong investigation and response process supports both your organization's security goals and its compliance obligations.
