quiz:
  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "You're investigating a data loss prevention (DLP) alert where a user uploaded a file named 'Budget_2025.xlsx' to a personal cloud storage account. To understand what policy triggered the alert and whether it was a false positive, where should you start your investigation?"
    choices:
    - content: "Microsoft Sentinel"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect: Microsoft Sentinel is used for broader incident correlation, not reviewing DLP policy triggers directly."
    - content: "Microsoft Defender XDR"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect: Microsoft Defender XDR shows incidents but isn't the primary place to check DLP policy details."
    - content: "Microsoft Purview"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct: Microsoft Purview focuses on DLP policy matches and is the best place to validate what triggered the alert."

  - content: "During your investigation, you notice the same user downloaded multiple files from SharePoint earlier that day. Which tool gives you the clearest view of all related activity in one place?"
    choices:
    - content: "Activity explorer"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect: Activity explorer focuses on user actions but doesn't group events into incidents."
    - content: "Microsoft Defender XDR"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct: Defender XDR groups related alerts and user activity into incidents for a consolidated view."
    - content: "Microsoft Purview portal"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect: The Microsoft Purview portal focuses on compliance tasks, not incident correlation."

  - content: "You want to ensure another analyst follows up on this DLP alert. What should you do in Microsoft Defender XDR?"
    choices:
    - content: "Assign the incident and update the status"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct: Assigning the incident and updating the status ensures accountability and tracking through resolution."
    - content: "Add the alert to a SharePoint list"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect: SharePoint isn't used for incident workflow in Defender XDR."
    - content: "Set the alert to simulation mode"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect: Simulation mode is used during testing policies, not for real alerts."

  - content: "You confirm the user improperly handled sensitive financial data. What remediation action is appropriate within Microsoft Defender XDR?"
    choices:
    - content: "Disable the user's account or remove file access"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct: Disabling the account or removing file access protects organizational data after a confirmed incident."
    - content: "Adjust the DLP policy immediately"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect: Policy tuning comes after remediation, not as an immediate incident response."
    - content: "Delete the alert from the incident queue"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect: Deleting alerts isn't part of the standard remediation process."

  - content: "After resolving the incident, what step helps improve your DLP policy and reduce false positives in the future?"
    choices:
    - content: "Tune the DLP policy based on investigation findings"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct: Policy tuning ensures that detection rules are optimized based on real-world investigations."
    - content: "Reset the policy match counter"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect: There's no reset counter process in DLP policies."
    - content: "Archive the incident in Microsoft Sentinel"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect: Archiving is for recordkeeping but doesn't improve DLP policies directly."
