-   Develop security operations for hybrid and multi-cloud environments

-   Design a strategy for Security Information and Event Management
    (SIEM) and Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR)

-   Evaluate security workflows

-   Review security strategies for incident management

-   Evaluate security operations for technical threat intelligence
