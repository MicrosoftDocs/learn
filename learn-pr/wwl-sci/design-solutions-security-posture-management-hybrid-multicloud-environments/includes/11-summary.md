In this module, you learned how to design security posture management solutions for hybrid and multicloud environments. You explored how organizations like Contoso can achieve unified visibility and consistent security policies across Azure, AWS, Google Cloud, and on-premises infrastructure.

You learned how to:

- Evaluate security posture using Microsoft Cloud Security Benchmark (MCSB) as a foundation for security standards and regulatory compliance mapping.
- Design integrated solutions that combine Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) for configuration assessment with Cloud Workload Protection (CWP) for runtime threat detection.
- Assess and improve security posture using Defender for Cloud's secure score and prioritized recommendations.
- Design workload protection for servers, containers, databases, storage, and other resource types using Defender for Cloud plans.
- Extend security posture management to hybrid and multicloud environments using Azure Arc.
- Design external attack surface discovery using Defender EASM to identify internet-exposed assets.
- Specify requirements for unified posture management using Microsoft Security Exposure Management's attack paths, initiatives, and prioritization capabilities.

With these capabilities, security architects can deliver comprehensive visibility across distributed environments, prioritize remediation based on actual risk, and maintain consistent security policies regardless of where workloads run.
