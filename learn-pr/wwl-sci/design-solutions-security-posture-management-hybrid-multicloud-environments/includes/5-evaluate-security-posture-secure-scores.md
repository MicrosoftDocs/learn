## Overview of secure score in Microsoft Defender for Cloud

Microsoft Defender for Cloud has two main goals:

-   to help you understand your current security situation
-   to help you efficiently and effectively improve your security

The central feature in Defender for Cloud that enables you to achieve those goals is the **secure score**.

Defender for Cloud continually assesses your cross-cloud resources for security issues. It then aggregates all the findings into a single score so that you can tell, at a glance, your current security situation: the higher the score, the lower the identified risk level.

## Defender for Cloud secure score

Defender for Cloud displays your score prominently in the portal. When you select the Secure score tile on the overview page, you're taken to the dedicated secure score page, where you'll see the score broken down by subscription. Select a single subscription to see the detailed list of prioritized recommendations and the potential effect that remediating them will have on the subscription's score.

Your secure score is shown in the following locations in Defender for Cloud's portal pages.
