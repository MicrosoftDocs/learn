In this module, you learned how to use Microsoft's security frameworks to design comprehensive security solutions. The Microsoft Security Adoption Framework (SAF) provides the strategic roadmap for security modernization, while the Microsoft Cybersecurity Reference Architecture (MCRA) serves as the technical blueprint showing how security capabilities integrate across your environment. The Microsoft Cloud Security Benchmark (MCSB) provides specific, actionable controls to implement these capabilities.

You also learned how to design solutions that protect against three distinct threat categories: insider threats, external attacks, and supply chain compromises. Each category requires different controls, but they share common elements rooted in Zero Trust principles—verify explicitly, use least privilege, and assume breach.

Finally, you explored AI security and its three core pillars: AI platform security, AI application security, and monitoring and response. The MCSB v2 AI controls (AI-1 through AI-7) provide a framework for addressing AI-specific risks like model theft, prompt injection, and adversarial attacks.

The main takeaways from this module are:

- Use Zero Trust as your strategic mindset, MCRA as your architectural blueprint, and MCSB controls to validate each security domain.
- Design layered defenses that address insider threats, external attacks, and supply chain risks with overlapping controls.
- Integrate AI-specific security controls with your existing security architecture to enable responsible AI adoption.
