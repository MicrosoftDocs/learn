In this module, you have learned about the best practices for cybersecurity capabilities and controls. These practices are important to automate processes and allow people to focus on other activities. The Microsoft Cybersecurity Reference Architecture (MCRA) and Microsoft Cloud Security Benchmarks (MCSB) contain many of these best practices, including using a multi-technology approach, securing privileged access, and preparing for ransomware and extortion attacks. The MCRA also includes an attack chain diagram that depicts common techniques related to both external attacks and insider risks.

The main takeaways from this module are that effective security programs must protect against both insider risk as well as attacks from external threats. The best practices in MCRA and MCSB can help improve your security capabilities and controls. It is important to continuously improve coverage of the attack chain, balance investments into security controls, and reduce manual effort in security operations by integrating the use of security orchestration, automation, and response (SOAR), Machine Learning (ML), and User Entity Behavioral Analytics (UEBA) technologies.
