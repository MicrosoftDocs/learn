Imagine you're the lead cybersecurity architect at a global financial services company. Your organization is expanding its cloud footprint, deploying AI-powered customer service tools, and integrating with third-party vendors. Leadership asks you to design a security architecture that protects against sophisticated external attacks, prevents insider data leaks, and secures the new AI systems—all while meeting regulatory compliance requirements.

Where do you start? How do you ensure your security design is comprehensive and aligned with industry best practices?

This module covers best practices for cybersecurity capabilities and controls, which are essential to reduce the risk of attackers succeeding. You learn how to use Microsoft's security frameworks—the Security Adoption Framework (SAF), Microsoft Cybersecurity Reference Architecture (MCRA), and Microsoft Cloud Security Benchmark (MCSB)—to design comprehensive security solutions that address scenarios like the one described.

## Learning objectives
