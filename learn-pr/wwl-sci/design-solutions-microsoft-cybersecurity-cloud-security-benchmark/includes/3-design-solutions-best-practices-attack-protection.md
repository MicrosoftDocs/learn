Effective security programs must protect against both insider risk as well as attacks from external threats. You can find best practices for both throughout the Microsoft Cybersecurity Reference Architecture (MCRA) and Microsoft Cloud Security Benchmark (MCSB). While all security controls should reduce risk in one or both of these scenarios, this section will focus primarily on insider risk aspects and the security operations elements of external attacks.

An attack chain describes the typical chain of events during an attack that leads to organizational damage. This includes technical and non-technical steps taken by adversaries or insiders during the attack. It's important to note that there is no single linear path for either insider risk or external attacks. There are many common elements across attacks, but each one can take a unique path. For more information on resources in MCRA for attack chain modeling, see [Attack chain modeling](/training/modules/design-resiliency-strategy-common-cyberthreats-like-ransomware/1-common-cyberthreats-attack-patterns).

## Attack protection with MCRA

All of the security best practices in the MCRA and MCSB are intended to reduce risk of attackers succeeding. Several MCRA best practices focus directly on the security operations aspects of external attacks - detect, respond, recover.

These best practices include:  

- **Continuous improvement toward complete coverage** - Always work to continuously improve coverage of the attack chain to areas with no visibility and highly vulnerable  areas with no preventive controls.
- **Balanced control investments** - Balance investments into security controls across the full lifecycle of identify, protect, detect, respond, and recover
- **From SIEM for everything to "XDR + SIEM"** - The primary tool for security operations to detect attacks and respond to them has been the Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) capability. Once introduced, extended detection and response (XDR) tools quickly became indispensable for the platforms they monitor (starting with Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) for endpoints) because they quickly reduce false positives. These tools do not cover the breadth of sources that the SIEM does, but they greatly simplify and increase effectiveness of detection and response for technologies covered by XDR. Security  best practices then shifted to reflect the strengths of SIEM (broad visibility and correlation across all tools and technology) and of XDR tooling (simple high quality threat detection on covered assets), and the collective need for both types of tooling in security operations.
- **SOAR Automation and Modern Analytics** - Reduce the amount of manual effort in security operations by integrating the use of security orchestration, automation, and response (SOAR), Machine Learning (ML), and User Entity Behavioral Analytics (UEBA) technologies. SOAR technology automates manual efforts that distract and tire human analysts during detection, investigation, and other response tasks. ML greatly improves detection by allowing computers to extend human expertise over large datasets and spot anomalies that could be attacker activity. UEBA improves detection and investigation by profiling the individual user accounts and entities that attackers compromise, rather than attempting to find patterns in the full set of raw log data.
- **Adapt processes to Operational Technology (OT)** - Adjust your tools and processes to the constraints of OT environments as you integrate them. These environments prioritize safety and often have older systems which don't have patches available and may crash from an active scan. Focusing on approaches like passive network detections for threats and isolation of systems is often the best approach.
- **Build appropriate controls for Insider Risk as a distinct focus area** - While some of the objectives for insider risk attacks are  similar to external attacks, reducing insider risk is different than reducing risk from external attacks. Insider risks can include elements like:
    -   Leaks of sensitive data and data spillage
    -   Confidentiality violations
    -   Intellectual property (IP) theft
    -   Fraud
    -   Insider trading
    -   Regulatory compliance violations

## Attack protection with MCSB

The Microsoft Cloud Security Benchmark includes many best practices that help protect from insider and external attacks including the security controls listed in the table below focused on security operations related topics:

  

| MCSB Control Domain | Security Controls |
|---|---|
| Incident Response (IR)    | IR-1: Preparation - update incident response plan and handling process<br>   <br>IR-2: Preparation - setup incident notification<br>   <br>IR-3: Detection and analysis - create incidents based on   high-quality alerts<br>   <br>IR-4: Detection and analysis - investigate an incident<br>   <br>IR-5: Detection and analysis - prioritize incidents<br>   <br>IR-6: Containment, eradication and recovery - automate the incident handling<br>   <br>IR-7: Post-incident activity - conduct lesson learned and retain evidence    |
| Logging and Threat Detection (LT)    | LT-1: Enable threat detection capabilities<br>   <br>LT-2: Enable threat detection for identity and access   management<br>   <br>LT-3: Enable logging for security investigation<br>   <br>LT-4: Enable network logging for security investigation<br>   <br>LT-5: Centralize security log management and analysis<br>   <br>LT-6: Configure log storage retention<br>   <br>LT-7: Use approved time synchronization sources    |

For more information on the security controls in each of these areas, see [Microsoft cloud security benchmark docs](<https://aka.ms/benchmarkdocs>).

These best practices in MCRA and MCSB can help you improve your security program effectiveness for both insider risk as well as attacks by external threat actors.
