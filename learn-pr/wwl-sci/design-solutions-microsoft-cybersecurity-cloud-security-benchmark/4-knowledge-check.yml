quiz:
  questions:
    - content: "Which of the following best defines the objective of a cloud reference architecture like Microsoft Cybersecurity Reference Architecture (MCRA) from Microsoft?"
      choices:
      - content: "To handle all cloud migration projects with the same approach"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "MCRA does provide guidance on cloud migration, but it takes a wider view to provide an end-to-end, interdependent approach to cybersecurity across multiple scenarios, including migration."
      - content: "To prescribe a set of tools and vendors for building secure clouds"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Although MCRA provides specific tools and vendor selection guidance, its primary role is to provide an interoperable architecture that facilitates effective cybersecurity across different scenarios and technology stacks."
      - content: "To define a secure cloud architecture that can be implemented anywhere with any technology stack"
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "MCRA is designed to provide security-focused reference architecture guidance that can apply almost anywhere no matter what underlying technologies, workloads, or data types are involved."
      - content: "To focus only on technical security tips for cloud architects"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "MCRA includes technical guidance, but it has much more expansive goals for providing comprehensive security guidance at different levels of abstraction."
    - content: "What is a key benefit of using best practices, such as those found in the MCRA reference architecture when addressing cloud security concerns?"
      choices:
      - content: "Patterns eliminate the need for detailed security assessment for each individual project"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "The use of best practices does cut down the time required for security evaluation, but security assessments should still be carried out to ensure the right pattern is chosen and customized for each project's distinct requirements."
      - content: "Patterns reduce costs by limiting the number of components, platforms, and architectures that must be secured"
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "Using best practices can reduce staffing needs, complexity, and risk exposure, bringing financial benefits that arise from economies of reuse and simplification rather than reducing the number of platforms, components, or architectures alone."
      - content: "Patterns enable software to adapt to any type of threat in real-time"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Best practices can help provide for efficient responses to certain classes of arising threats, but they aren't dynamic enough to handle every possible attack vector."
    - content: "What is the purpose of the Microsoft Cloud Security Benchmark?"
      choices:
      - content: "To provide a set of recommended security configurations and best practices for Microsoft cloud services."
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "The Microsoft Cloud Security Benchmark is designed to provide a set of recommended security configurations and best practices for Microsoft cloud services."
      - content: "To provide a comprehensive list of all possible security threats to Microsoft cloud services."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "The Microsoft Cloud Security Benchmark isn't a comprehensive list of all possible security threats to Microsoft cloud services. Rather, it provides recommended security configurations and best practices."
      - content: "To provide a list of all security breaches that occurred in Microsoft cloud services."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "The Microsoft Cloud Security Benchmark doesn't provide a list of all security breaches that occurred in Microsoft cloud services."
      - content: "To provide a tool for testing the vulnerability of Microsoft cloud services to attacks."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "The Microsoft Cloud Security Benchmark isn't a tool for testing cloud service vulnerabilities."
    - content: "What is the difference between defensive and detective security controls, as discussed in the Microsoft cloud security benchmark"
      choices:
        - content: "Detective controls focus on changing user behavior while defensive controls monitor for incidents"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "This description reverses the meanings of the two types of controls. Defensive controls aim to reduce the likelihood and impact of security incidents while Detective controls aim to address Incidents when they happen (including looking for indicators of compromise like log data)."
        - content: "Defensive controls proactively prevent security incidents while Detective controls detect and respond to these incidents after they occur"
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "This text gives the correct explanation of the differences between the two types of controls as outlined in the 2021 Cloud Security Benchmark."
        - content: "Detective controls rely on passive monitoring of system logs while defensive controls require active scanning"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "This distinction isn't accurate as both types of controls might necessitate either active surveillance, passive monitoring, or a mix of the two techniques."
        - content: "Defensive controls rely entirely on preemptive configuration while Detective controls mostly operate via heuristic algorithms"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "This distinction is also not accurate as both types of control measures take advantage of heuristics and machine learning algorithms when feasible."
