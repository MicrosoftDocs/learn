quiz:
  questions:
    - content: "What is the relationship between the Microsoft Security Adoption Framework (SAF) and the Microsoft Cybersecurity Reference Architecture (MCRA)?"
      choices:
      - content: "SAF and MCRA are independent frameworks that address different security concerns"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "SAF and MCRA are designed to work together, not independently. MCRA is a key component of SAF."
      - content: "MCRA provides the strategic roadmap while SAF provides the technical architecture"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "This reverses their relationship. SAF provides the strategic roadmap and operational guidance, while MCRA provides the technical blueprint."
      - content: "SAF provides the strategic roadmap for security modernization while MCRA serves as the technical blueprint within SAF"
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "SAF provides the 'why and how' of security modernization (the strategic roadmap), while MCRA provides the 'what' (the detailed architecture of security capabilities) as a component within SAF."
      - content: "SAF replaces MCRA as the primary security guidance framework"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "SAF doesn't replace MCRA. Instead, MCRA serves as a key component within SAF, providing the technical architecture that aligns with SAF's strategic guidance."
    - content: "Which MCSB v2 security domain specifically addresses risks like prompt injection and model theft?"
      choices:
      - content: "Data Protection (DP)"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Data Protection covers data at rest, in transit, and access controls, but doesn't specifically address AI-specific risks like prompt injection."
      - content: "DevOps Security (DS)"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "DevOps Security covers security engineering and operations in DevOps processes, but AI-specific risks have their own dedicated domain."
      - content: "Artificial Intelligence Security (AIS)"
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "AI Security is a dedicated control domain in MCSB v2 that addresses security considerations specific to AI workloads, including risks like prompt injection, model theft, and adversarial attacks."
      - content: "Posture and Vulnerability Management (PV)"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Posture and Vulnerability Management focuses on assessing and improving cloud security posture, not AI-specific security risks."
    - content: "What are the three distinct threat categories that a Security Architect must design solutions to protect against?"
      choices:
      - content: "Network attacks, application attacks, and data breaches"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "While these are valid security concerns, the module organizes threat protection around insider threats, external attacks, and supply chain compromises."
      - content: "Insider threats, external attacks, and supply chain compromises"
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "These three threat categories require different controls but share common elements rooted in Zero Trust principles. Effective security architecture addresses all three with overlapping controls that create defense in depth."
      - content: "Phishing attacks, ransomware attacks, and denial-of-service attacks"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "These are specific attack types that fall under the broader category of external attacks, not the three main threat categories discussed in the module."
      - content: "Identity attacks, endpoint attacks, and cloud attacks"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "These relate to attack surfaces rather than the three threat categories (insider threats, external attacks, and supply chain compromises) discussed in the module."
    - content: "According to MCSB v2 AI security controls, what is the purpose of implementing safety meta-prompts?"
      choices:
        - content: "To improve the accuracy of AI model responses"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Safety meta-prompts aren't primarily about improving response accuracy. They're about guiding AI models toward secure and ethical behavior."
        - content: "To guide AI models toward intended, secure, and ethical behavior and resist prompt injection attacks"
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Safety meta-prompts use system instructions to guide AI models toward intended, secure, and ethical behavior. They're designed to prioritize system instructions over user inputs to resist prompt injection attacks."
        - content: "To reduce the computational cost of running AI models"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Safety meta-prompts are security controls, not performance optimizations. They address security risks like prompt injection."
        - content: "To enable AI models to learn from user interactions"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Safety meta-prompts are about security guardrails, not about enabling learning from user interactions."
