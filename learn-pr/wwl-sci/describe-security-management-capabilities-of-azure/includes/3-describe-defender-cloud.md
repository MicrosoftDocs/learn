Microsoft Defender for Cloud is a tool for security posture management and threat protection. It strengthens the security posture of your cloud resources, and with its integrated Microsoft Defender plans, Defender for Cloud protects workloads running in Azure, hybrid, and other cloud platforms.

Microsoft Defender for Cloud fills three vital needs as you manage the security of your resources and workloads in the cloud and on-premises:

- **Continuously assess** - Know your security posture, identify and track vulnerabilities.
- **Secure** - Harden all connected resources and services. 
- **Defend** - Detect and resolve threats to resources, workloads, and services.

The features of Microsoft Defender for Cloud, that deliver on these requirements, cover two broad pillars of cloud security: cloud security posture management and cloud workload protection.

### Cloud security posture management (CSPM)

In Microsoft Defender for Cloud, the posture management features provide:

- Visibility - to help you understand your current security situation
- Hardening guidance - to help you efficiently and effectively improve your security

#### Visibility and hardening recommendations

The central feature in Microsoft Defender for Cloud that enables you to achieve those goals is secure score. Microsoft Defender for Cloud continually assesses your resources, subscriptions, and organization for security issues. It then aggregates all the findings into a single score so that you can tell, at a glance, your current security situation: the higher the score, the lower the identified risk level.

Microsoft Defender for Cloud also provides hardening recommendations based on any identified security misconfigurations and weaknesses. Recommendations are grouped into security controls. Each control is a logical group of related security recommendations, and reflects your vulnerable attack surfaces. Your score only improves when you remediate all of the recommendations for a single resource within a control. Use these security recommendations to strengthen the security posture of your organization's Azure, hybrid, and multi-cloud resources.

### Cloud workload protection (CWP)

The second pillar of cloud security is cloud workload protection. Through cloud workload protection capabilities, Microsoft Defender for Cloud is able to detect and resolve threats to resources, workloads, and services. Cloud workload protections are delivered through integrated Microsoft Defender plans, specific to the types of resources in your subscriptions and provide enhanced security features for your workloads.  These are described in the next unit.
