          explanation: "Actually, the shared responsibility model entails that both the cloud provider and the customer share security responsibilities."
        - content: "A model in which customers are responsible for all aspects of security."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Actually, the shared responsibility model entails that both the cloud provider and the customer share security responsibilities."
        - content: "A model in which cloud service providers are responsible for physical security, while the customer is responsible for logical security."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Actually, the shared responsibility model entails that both the cloud provider and the customer share security responsibilities."
        - content: "A model in which cloud service providers and customers share security responsibilities."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "The shared responsibility model entails that while cloud service providers are responsible for physical infrastructure and basic platform security, the customers are responsible for the security of everything they build or deploy on top of the platform."
    - content: "Which of the following is a recommended IaaS security best practice?"
      choices:
        - content: "Using publicly available virtual machine images."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Using publicly available virtual machine images can introduce unnecessary risk into your environment, as you don't know what might be included. It's not recommended."
        - content: "Storing unencrypted disk snapshots in a public container."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Storing unencrypted disk snapshots in a public container can make them vulnerable to unauthorized access. It isn't a recommended security best practice."
        - content: "Applying strict network security group configurations to restrict inbound and outbound traffic."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "By applying strict network security group configurations, you can reduce the attack surface of your environment and protect against unauthorized access by reducing the number of ports open to traffic."
        - content: "Using default credentials for virtual machines."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Using default credentials for virtual machines can make them vulnerable to brute-force attacks. It isn't a recommended security best practice."

          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Prohibiting the use of custom domains may restrict your business needs unnecessarily. It isn't a recommended security best practice."
        - content: "Enabling managed service identity for applications and services."
