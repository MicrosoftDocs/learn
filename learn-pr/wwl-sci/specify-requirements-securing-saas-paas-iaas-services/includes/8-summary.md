In this module, you learned how security architects specify security requirements across different cloud service models and workload types. You explored how responsibility shifts between Microsoft and customers depending on whether solutions use IaaS, PaaS, or SaaS deployment models.

You learned how to:

- Specify security baselines for SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS services using the shared responsibility model.
- Specify security requirements for IoT workloads including device identity, network segmentation, and monitoring.
- Specify security requirements for web workloads covering authentication, network protection, and application security.
- Specify security requirements for containers and container orchestration including cluster security, image integrity, and runtime protection.
- Evaluate security controls for AI services using MCSB v2 AI-specific controls and the AI shared responsibility model.
