As a security architect, you design security requirements for cloud workloads across Software as a Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) deployment models. Each model shifts different responsibilities between your organization and the cloud provider, requiring you to specify appropriate security controls for the components you manage.

This module prepares you to specify security requirements for common Azure workloads including IoT devices, web applications, containers, and AI services. You learn how to apply the Microsoft Cloud Security Benchmark (MCSB) to establish security baselines and evaluate solutions against security best practices.

## Scenario

Your organization operates a diverse Azure environment with IoT devices collecting manufacturing data, web applications serving customers, containerized microservices, and AI-powered applications using Azure OpenAI. As the security architect, you must specify security requirements that protect each workload type while enabling business operations. You need to understand how the shared responsibility model affects your security obligations and how to apply security baselines consistently across different service types.

## Learning objectives

By the end of this module, you're able to:

- Specify security baselines for SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS services using the Microsoft Cloud Security Benchmark
- Specify security requirements for IoT workloads including device authentication, network isolation, and threat detection
- Specify security requirements for web workloads including WAF protection, identity controls, and secure deployment
- Specify security requirements for containers and container orchestration including AKS cluster security, image security, and pod security standards
- Evaluate solutions that include Azure AI services security using MCSB v2 AI-specific controls

## Prerequisites

- Advanced experience and knowledge in identity and access, platform protection, security operations, securing data, and securing applications
- Experience with hybrid and cloud implementations
- Familiarity with Azure services including Azure Kubernetes Service, App Service, IoT Hub, and Azure OpenAI
