When an organization needs to respond to a legal investigation or regulatory request, it's not enough to hand over random emails or files. Instead, there's a structured legal process for finding, preserving, reviewing, and producing that information in a way that's defensible. This process is called **eDiscovery**, short for **electronic discovery**.

## eDiscovery as a legal and investigative process

eDiscovery is a process used to identify, collect, and produce electronically stored information (ESI) during legal proceedings, internal investigations, audits, or regulatory reviews. This could include emails, chat messages, documents, or anything else stored digitally that's relevant to a case.

There are generally five stages to the eDiscovery process:

1. **Identification**: Locate potentially relevant information.
1. **Preservation**: Make sure the content isn't deleted or altered.
1. **Collection**: Gather the content for analysis.
1. **Review**: Filter, tag, or redact content before sharing it.
1. **Export/Production**: Prepare the content for legal teams or regulatory authorities.

While many people think of eDiscovery as something only legal teams handle, that's not always the case. Security teams, compliance officers, and HR professionals also rely on eDiscovery tools to conduct internal investigations and respond to incidents.

## eDiscovery in Microsoft 365

Microsoft 365 includes a built-in set of tools that help organizations manage each step of the eDiscovery process. These tools are available through **Microsoft Purview**, the compliance and risk management portal for Microsoft 365.

When you use Microsoft Purview for eDiscovery, you can:

- Create and manage eDiscovery **cases**
- Assign **custodians** and place their content on legal hold
- Run targeted **searches** across mailboxes, Teams messages, OneDrive files, and more
- Analyze results in **review sets**
- Export content or even **purge** sensitive items if needed

All of these actions are tracked for auditing purposes and can be restricted based on role-based access controls.

## Use Microsoft Purview for an investigation

Here's a typical example of how someone might use eDiscovery in Microsoft Purview:

Let's say your organization is investigating whether confidential project files were leaked to a competitor. The legal and security teams need to find out:

- Who had access to those files?
- Were they shared externally?
- What was said about them in email or Teams?

In Microsoft Purview, they would:

- Create an **eDiscovery case** to contain all activity related to the investigation.
- Add specific employees as **custodians** and apply a **legal hold** to preserve their data.
- Use the **Search** feature to look across Exchange, SharePoint, OneDrive, and Teams for references to the project.
- Add matching results to a **review set**, where they can tag and filter the data.
- Take appropriate action, such as exporting the results for legal review or purging externally shared content if a data leak is confirmed.

## How Microsoft Purview supports eDiscovery

Microsoft Purview helps organizations take a structured and defensible approach to handling sensitive or legally relevant data. It integrates with Microsoft 365 services like Exchange, SharePoint, OneDrive, Teams, and Microsoft Defender to centralize the eDiscovery process. Instead of relying on manual collection or disconnected searches, Purview allows each step to be tracked, governed, and carried out consistently.

Understanding eDiscovery as both a legal process and a practical workflow helps clarify how Microsoft Purview fits into investigations and compliance tasks. These tools support legal, compliance, security, and HR teams as they work to identify, preserve, and review content in response to investigations or legal obligations.
