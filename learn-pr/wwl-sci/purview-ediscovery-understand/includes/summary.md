Investigations require more than improvised searches. Organizations need tools that support a defensible eDiscovery process across Microsoft 365 services. Microsoft Purview provides those tools through a modern eDiscovery experience designed to help teams work efficiently while maintaining compliance.

Microsoft Purview supports the full eDiscovery lifecycle, from identifying and preserving content to reviewing and exporting it. The updated experience introduces key improvements over the classic one, and feature availability depends on licensing. Access is managed through permissions that limit sensitive case data to authorized users.

Understanding how eDiscovery works in Microsoft Purview helps organizations handle investigations with more control and less guesswork. With the right tools and permissions in place, teams can move quickly to preserve data, manage access, and deliver results that meet legal and regulatory expectations while minimizing disruption to daily operations.
