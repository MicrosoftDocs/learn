Legal investigations, regulatory requests, and internal reviews often require more than just finding documents. Organizations need a consistent, defensible process for identifying, preserving, reviewing, and producing electronically stored information (ESI). Without the right tools in place, responding to these requests can be slow, inconsistent, or incomplete, putting the organization at risk.

Microsoft Purview provides eDiscovery tools that help legal, compliance, and security teams manage this process end to end. With support for role-based access control, content search, legal holds, review sets, and advanced analytics, organizations can respond to investigations with confidence and consistency.

- How the eDiscovery process works and why it matters
- What changed in the new eDiscovery experience
- How Microsoft Purview supports each stage of the eDiscovery lifecycle
