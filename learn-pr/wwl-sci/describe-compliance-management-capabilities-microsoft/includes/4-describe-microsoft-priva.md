Privacy is top of mind for organizations and consumers today, and concerns about how private data is handled are steadily increasing. Regulations and laws impact people around the world, setting rules for how organizations store personal data and giving people rights to manage personal data collected by an organization.

To meet regulatory requirements and build customer trust, organizations need to take a "privacy by default" stance. Rather than manual processes and a patchwork of tools, organizations need a comprehensive solution.

Microsoft Priva is a comprehensive set of privacy solutions that support privacy operations across your organization's entire digital estate and enables your organization to consolidate privacy protection across your data landscape, streamline compliance with regulations, and mitigate privacy risk.

The Priva suite of solutions has expanded to include the following solutions:

### Priva Privacy Risk Management

Microsoft Priva Privacy Risk Management gives you the capability to set up policies that identify privacy risks in your Microsoft 365 environment and enable easy remediation. Policy options in Privacy Risk Management can help you find issues in the following areas of privacy concern and guide your users through recommended steps for remediation.

- ***Limit data overexposure***. Data overexposure policies, which can be set up to cover both Microsoft 365 and multicloud (preview) locations, can help you detect and handle situations in which data that your organization has stored is insufficiently secure. For example, Privacy Risk Management can alert you if access to an internal site is open to too many people or your permissions settings haven't been maintained. Privacy Risk Management also offers remediation options that help your users resolve any issues that are found. For data overexposure, these include making content items private, notifying content owners, or tagging items for further review.

- ***Find and mitigate data transfers***. Data transfer policies allow you to monitor for transfers between different world regions or between departments in your organization, and transfers outside of your organization. When a policy match is detected, you can send users email notifications that allow them to take corrective action right in the email, such as making content items private, notifying content owners, or tagging items for further review.

- ***Minimize stored data***. Data minimization policies allow you to look for data that your organization has been storing for at least a certain length of time. This can help you manage your ongoing storage practices. When policy matches are found, remediation options include marking items for deletion, notifying content owners, or tagging items for further review.

The summary and resources unit of this module, includes a link to learn more about Privacy Risk Management policies that provides more details on policy settings, including data sources supported and the data types to monitor.

### Priva Subject Rights Requests

In accordance with certain privacy regulations around the world, individuals (or data subjects) may make requests to review or manage the personal data about themselves that companies have collected. These requests are sometimes also referred to as data subject requests (DSRs), data subject access requests (DSARs), or consumer rights requests. For companies that store large amounts of information, finding the relevant data can be a formidable task.

Microsoft Priva can help you handle these inquiries through the Subject Rights Requests solution, which can address subject rights request for data within your organization's Microsoft 365 environment. The solution provides automation, insights, and workflows to help organizations fulfill requests more confidently and efficiently.
