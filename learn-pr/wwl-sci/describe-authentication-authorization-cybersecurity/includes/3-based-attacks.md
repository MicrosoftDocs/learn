Authentication attacks occur when someone tries to steal another person's credentials. They can then pretend to be that person.  Because an objective of these types of attacks is to impersonate a legitimate user, they can also often be referred to as identity attacks. Common attacks include, but are not limited to:

- Brute force attack
- Dictionary attack
- Credential stuffing
- Keylogging
- Social engineering

### Brute force attack

In a brute force attack, a criminal will attempt to gain access simply by trying different usernames and password combinations. Typically, attackers have tools that automate this process by using millions of username and password combinations. Simple passwords, with single-factor authentication, are vulnerable to brute force attacks.

### Dictionary attack

A dictionary attack is a form of brute force attack, where a dictionary of commonly used words is applied. To prevent dictionary attacks, it’s important to use symbols, numbers, and multiple word combinations in a password.

### Credential stuffing

Credential stuffing is an attack method that takes advantage of the fact that many people use the same username and password across many sites. Attackers will use stolen credentials, usually obtained after a data breach on one site, to attempt to access other areas. Attackers typically use software tools to automate this process. To prevent credential stuffing, it's important not to reuse passwords, and to change them regularly, particularly after a security breach.

### Keylogging

Keylogging involves malicious software that logs keystrokes. Using the key logger, an attacker can log (steal) username and password combinations, which can then be used for credential stuffing attacks. This is a common attack at internet cafes or anywhere you use a shared computer for access. To prevent keylogging, don't install untrusted software and use reputable virus-scanning software.

Keylogging isn't limited to just computers. Suppose a bad actor installs a box or device over the card reader and keypad at an ATM. When you insert your card, it passes first through the bad actors card reader - capturing the card details, before feeding it into the ATMs card reader. Now, when you key in your pin using the bad actor's keypad, they get your pin as well.

### Social engineering

Social engineering involves an attempt to get people to reveal information or complete an action to enable an attack.

Most authentication attacks involve exploitation of computers or an attempt to try many credential combinations. Social engineering attacks are different in that they exploit the vulnerabilities of humans. The attacker tries to gain the trust of a legitimate user. They persuade the user to divulge information or take an action that enables them to cause damage or steal information.

A number of social engineering techniques can be used for authentication theft, including:

- **Phishing** occurs when an attacker sends a seemingly legitimate email with the objective of having a user reveal their authentication credentials. For example, an email might appear to be from the user’s bank. A link opens to what looks like the bank’s login page, but is actually a fake site. When a user logs in at the fake site, their credentials become available to the attacker. There are several variations of phishing, including spear-phishing, which targets specific organizations, businesses, or individuals.
- **Pretexting** is a method where an attacker gains the victim's trust and convinces them to divulge secure information. This can then be used to steal their identity. For example, a hacker might call you, pretending to be from the bank, and ask for your password to verify your identity. Another approach uses social media. You might get asked to complete a survey or a quiz, where they asked seemingly random and innocent questions that get you to reveal personal facts, or you'll get something that looks fun, like making up the name for your fantasy pop-star band by using the name of your first pet and the place you were born.
- **Baiting** is a form of attack where the criminal offers a fake reward or prize to encourage the victim to divulge secure information.

### Other authentication-based attack methods

These are just a few examples of authentication-based attacks. There's always the potential for new attack types, but all of the ones listed here can be prevented by educating people and using multifactor authentication.
