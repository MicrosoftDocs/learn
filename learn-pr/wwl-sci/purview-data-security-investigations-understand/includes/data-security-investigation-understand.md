A data security investigation focuses on understanding **what data is involved in a security concern**, **how that data was used**, and **what risk it presents**. The goal isn't to detect activity or generate alerts, but to determine the **actual scope and risk** of a potential data security issue.

For example, an alert might show a file was downloaded. An activity-based investigation asks who downloaded it and when. A data security investigation asks: Was the file sensitive? Where did it come from? Did the activity create risk, or was it expected behavior?

A data security investigation exists to close that gap.



## How data security investigations differ from activity-based investigation

Traditional security investigation often starts with activity. An alert fires, a user performs an action, or a signal indicates something unusual. From there, the investigation focuses on timelines, indicators, and behavior.

A data security investigation starts from a different place. It centers on **the data itself**.

Instead of asking only what happened, a data security investigation asks:

- What data was involved?
- Where does that data live?
- How sensitive is it?
- Who accessed or handled it?
- Does the data create risk in this context?

This shift matters because not all activity involving data is risky, and not all risky data activity is obvious from alerts alone.

## What a data security investigation helps you understand

A data security investigation is designed to help answer questions such as:

- Whether sensitive or high-value data was exposed
- Whether the scope of exposure is small and contained or broad and systemic
- Whether the situation requires remediation, escalation, or no action at all

These answers support informed decisions. They help avoid both under-reacting to real risk and over-reacting to noise.

## Where Data Security Investigations fits

**Microsoft Purview Data Security Investigations** provides a dedicated investigation experience for this kind of analysis. It brings together data context, activity signals, and AI-assisted analysis so investigations can focus on **data impact**, not just events.

By centering investigations on data sensitivity and exposure, teams can assess risk more accurately and decide when action is actually required.
