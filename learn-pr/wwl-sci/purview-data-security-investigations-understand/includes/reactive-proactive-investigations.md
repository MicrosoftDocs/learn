Data security investigations can be used in two ways: **reactively**, in response to known events, and **proactively**, to assess potential risk before an incident occurs. Understanding the difference helps ensure investigations are used with the right intent and level of effort.

## Reactive investigations

Reactive investigations start with a signal that something might be wrong. This signal might come from an alert, a case, or a reported concern. The investigation focuses on validating what happened and determining whether sensitive data was involved.

In a reactive investigation, the goal is to:

- Confirm whether data exposure occurred
- Understand the scope of the activity
- Determine whether action or escalation is required

Reactive investigations are most useful when activity is already visible, but its significance is unclear. They help move from suspicion to confidence by adding data context to known events.

## Proactive investigations

Proactive investigations take a different approach. Instead of starting with a confirmed incident, they begin with a question or assumption about potential risk.

For example, an organization might want to understand:

- Whether certain data sets are broadly accessible
- Whether sensitive data is commonly handled in risky ways
- Whether existing protections align with how data is used

In these cases, a proactive investigation helps assess risk without waiting for an alert to fire.

This approach can feel unfamiliar, especially in environments where investigations are traditionally tied to incidents. The intent isn't to search for wrongdoing, but to validate assumptions and identify gaps before they lead to exposure.

## Choosing the right approach

Reactive and proactive investigations serve different purposes, and neither replaces the other. The key is using each approach deliberately.

Reactive investigations are appropriate when:

- Activity has already been identified
- Decisions depend on understanding data exposure
- Timely validation is needed

Proactive investigations are appropriate when:

- Risk is suspected but not yet visible
- Data handling patterns need review
- Preventive decisions require evidence

With this distinction in mind, you can look at when deeper investigation adds value and when simpler approaches are sufficient.
