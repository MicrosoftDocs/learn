Data security investigations are designed to answer specific questions about data risk. Understanding what data security investigations are designed to do, and what they aren't meant to replace, helps ensure they're used intentionally.

## What a data security investigation is

A data security investigation is a **data-centric investigation approach**. It brings together data context, activity signals, and analysis to help determine whether sensitive or high-value data is at risk, and to what extent.

Rather than focusing only on events, a data security investigation emphasizes:

- The type and sensitivity of the data involved
- Where that data lives and how it's accessed
- How activity affects data exposure and risk

**Microsoft Purview Data Security Investigations** provides this capability by correlating data and activity information so investigations can focus on understanding risk, not just tracking actions.

## What a data security investigation isn't

A data security investigation isn't designed to replace existing security or compliance tools. It doesn't function as:

- An alerting system that detects suspicious activity
- An incident response workflow for containment and remediation
- A case management solution for legal or regulatory review
- A substitute for audit logs or activity tracking

Those tools remain essential. Data security investigations complement them by providing depth when understanding data exposure and sensitivity is critical.

## Why these boundaries matter

Without clear boundaries, investigations can become inefficient or misleading. Using a data security investigation when simpler tools are sufficient can slow response time. Relying only on alerts when deeper analysis is needed can lead to decisions based on incomplete information.

Data security investigations are most effective when used:

- After activity has been identified and requires validation
- When the scope or sensitivity of data is unclear
- When decisions depend on confidence rather than speed alone

Recognizing what the tool is designed to do helps ensure it's applied where it adds the most value.
