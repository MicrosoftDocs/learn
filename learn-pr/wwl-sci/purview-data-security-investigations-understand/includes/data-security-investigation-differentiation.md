Security teams use several tools to investigate activity and assess risk. Each serves a distinct purpose. Each serves a different purpose, and understanding those differences helps determine when a data security investigation is the right choice.

Data security investigations don't replace alerts, cases, or audit. They fill a specific gap when decisions depend on understanding **data exposure and sensitivity**, not just activity.

### Alerts focus on activity signals

Alerts are designed to surface activity that might require attention. They're effective for identifying:

- Unusual behavior
- Policy violations
- Potential security events

Alerts answer questions like:

- What happened?
- Who performed the action?
- When did it occur?

What alerts often don't provide is enough data context to assess risk. An alert can confirm that activity occurred without showing whether sensitive data was involved or exposed.

### Cases organize investigation work

Cases help group related alerts, evidence, and actions into a single investigation record. They're useful for:

- Tracking investigation progress
- Coordinating work across teams
- Documenting decisions and outcomes

Cases improve organization, but they don't inherently add data insight. Understanding data sensitivity and exposure often still requires investigation outside the case structure.

### Audit provides detailed activity records

Audit logs capture detailed records of actions taken across services and workloads. They're valuable for:

- Reviewing historical activity
- Verifying who did what and when
- Supporting compliance and review requirements

Audit data is comprehensive, but it's activity-centric. It typically requires manual effort to correlate events with data sensitivity, scope, and risk.

### Where data security investigations fit

Data security investigations focus on **data context**, not just events. They bring together:

- Information about the data itself
- Activity associated with that data
- Analysis that helps assess exposure and risk

This approach is most useful when:

- Alerts identify activity but don't provide enough confidence to act
- Audit logs show behavior without clarifying data sensitivity
- Decisions require validation before remediation or escalation

Now that you understand how data security investigations differ from alerts, cases, and audit, you can look at how investigations can be used in both reactive and proactive ways.
