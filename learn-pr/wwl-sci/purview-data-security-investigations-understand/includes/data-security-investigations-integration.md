Data security investigations don't operate in isolation. They're designed to complement existing security and data protection tools by adding depth when understanding data exposure and sensitivity is critical.

Rather than replacing other investigation workflows, data security investigations extend them by focusing on **data context** and **risk validation**.

## How investigations connect to detection and response

Many investigations begin with activity detected elsewhere. Alerts, cases, and signals help surface potential concerns quickly, but they don't always provide enough information to assess data risk.

Data security investigations fit into this flow by:

- Add data context to activity identified by other tools
- Validate whether sensitive or high-value data was involved
- Support decisions about response, escalation, or policy changes

This makes them especially useful after initial detection, when confidence matters more than speed.

## Relationship to other Microsoft security capabilities

Data security investigations integrate with several Microsoft security experiences, each contributing different signals and context.

- **Microsoft Defender XDR**: Provides alerts and activity signals that might indicate potential risk. Data security investigations help determine whether those signals involve sensitive data and what exposure looks like.

- **Microsoft Purview Insider Risk Management**: Surfaces risky patterns related to user behavior. Data security investigations add depth by validating data scope and sensitivity when activity raises concern.

- **Microsoft Purview Data Security Posture Management**: Helps identify where sensitive data exists and where risk might be emerging. These insights can inform when proactive investigations are worth running to validate assumptions.

Each tool contributes a different part of the picture. Data security investigations help connect those signals to the data itself.

## Using investigations as part of a broader workflow

Data security investigations are most effective when used as part of a broader investigation and protection workflow, not as a starting point for every issue.

They're best used:

- After potential risk has been identified
- When decisions depend on understanding data exposure
- When validation is needed before action is taken

Used this way, investigations support more accurate decisions and help align detection, response, and prevention efforts around real data risk.
