Security teams investigate activity every day. Alerts, cases, and audit logs can show who did something and when it happened. What's often harder to determine is **what happened to the data itself**.

When sensitive or high-value data is involved, activity alone doesn't always provide enough information to make confident decisions. Teams might see that an action occurred without knowing whether the data was sensitive, how exposed it became, or whether the situation represents real risk. Data security investigations exist to close that gap by focusing on data context, sensitivity, and exposure.

By understanding when and how to use data security investigations, teams can apply deeper analysis where it adds value and rely on simpler investigation paths when appropriate.

By the end of this module, you'll be able to:

- Explain what a data security investigation is and what it's designed to solve
- Describe how data security investigations differ from alerts, cases, and audit
- Distinguish between reactive and proactive investigation approaches
- Recognize when deeper investigation adds value and when simpler paths are sufficient
- Understand how data security investigations fit into broader Microsoft security workflows
