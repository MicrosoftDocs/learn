Security teams investigate activity every day, but understanding **what happened to the data** is often harder than detecting the activity itself. Alerts, cases, and audit logs can show who did something and when, but they don't always answer more important questions. Was the data sensitive? How exposed was it? Did the activity create real risk, or was it expected behavior?

Data security investigations focus on answering those questions. Instead of centering on events alone, they examine data context, sensitivity, and exposure to help teams make informed decisions about response and prevention. This approach supports both reactive investigations, where activity has already occurred, and proactive investigations, where potential risk needs validation before an incident happens.

Understanding when and how to use data security investigations helps avoid unnecessary escalation, reduces guesswork, and ensures deeper analysis is applied only when it adds value. It also clarifies how this capability fits alongside existing security tools rather than replacing them.

By the end of this module, you'll be able to:

- Explain what a data security investigation is and what it's designed to solve
- Describe how data security investigations differ from alerts, cases, and audit
- Distinguish between reactive and proactive investigation approaches
- Recognize when deeper investigation adds value and when simpler paths are sufficient
- Understand how data security investigations fit into broader Microsoft security workflows
