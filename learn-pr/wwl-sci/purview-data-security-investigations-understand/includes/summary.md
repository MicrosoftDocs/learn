Understanding data security investigations starts with knowing their role. They aren't designed to detect activity or replace existing investigation tools. They're designed to add data context when decisions depend on understanding sensitivity, exposure, and risk.

In this module, you learned how to:

- Explain what a data security investigation is and what it's designed to solve
- Describe how data security investigations differ from alerts, cases, and audit
- Distinguish between reactive and proactive investigation approaches
- Recognize when deeper investigation adds value and when simpler paths are sufficient
- Understand how data security investigations fit into broader Microsoft security workflows

Without this understanding, teams might rely too heavily on activity signals alone or apply deeper investigation when it isn't needed. Using data security investigations intentionally helps align detection, investigation, and response around real data risk rather than assumptions.

This foundation prepares you to use data security investigations where confidence matters most and to integrate them effectively with tools like **Microsoft Purview** and **Microsoft Defender** experiences.
