  questions:

  - content: An organization needs to retain audit records for a longer period of time and gain access to high-value intelligent insights. Which auditing solution should they use?
    choices:
    - content: Microsoft 365 Management Activity API
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. The Microsoft 365 Management Activity API is a method to retrieve audit logs, not an auditing solution.
    - content: Audit (Standard)
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. Audit (Standard) does not provide longer retention of audit records or high-value intelligent insights.
    - content: Audit (Premium)
      isCorrect: true

  - content: An investigator is tasked with identifying and reviewing content in Microsoft 365 services for a legal case. They need to preserve relevant content from inadvertent deletion during the investigation. Which eDiscovery feature should they use?
    choices:
    - content: Place content locations on hold
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. 'Place content locations on hold' allows preservation of content relevant to an investigation by securing electronically stored information.
    - content: Export search results
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. 'Export search results' allows copying of items from their original content location for download, not preserving content.
    - content: Search statistics and samples
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. 'Search statistics and samples' allows viewing of estimated search results and representative samples, not preserving content.

  - content: An organization wants to ensure that its employees are adhering to corporate policies in their day-to-day business communications. They want to detect any potential concerns of offensive language or harassment. Which Microsoft tool can they use to scan user communications across the organization?
    choices:
    - content: Microsoft Copilot for Microsoft 365
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. Microsoft Copilot for Microsoft 365 is a tool for managing Microsoft 365 services, not for scanning and detecting communication policy violations.
    - content: Microsoft Purview Communication Compliance
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. Microsoft Purview Communication Compliance is an insider risk solution that helps detect, capture, and act on inappropriate messages that can lead to potential data security or compliance incidents within an organization.
    - content: Microsoft Teams
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. While Microsoft Teams is a communication platform, it does not have built-in features for scanning and detecting policy violations.

  - content: A company needs to manage its data lifecycle by ensuring content is kept only for a required time, and then permanently deleted. They want to apply different retention periods to different documents within the same SharePoint site. What should they do to achieve this?
    choices:
    - content: Apply a single retention label to all documents in the SharePoint site.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. Applying a single retention label to all documents would not allow for different retention periods for different documents.
    - content: Apply a policy to the SharePoint site with a retention period of five years and apply a retention label to the individual items with a retention setting of 10 years.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. This approach allows for different retention periods for different documents within the same SharePoint site.
    - content: Apply a single retention policy to the entire SharePoint site with a retention period of five years.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. Applying a single retention policy to the entire SharePoint site would not allow for different retention periods for different documents.

  - content: An administrator is setting up retention labels for an organization's records. What happens when content is labeled as a record using a retention label?
    choices:
    - content: Restrictions are put in place to block certain activities, activities are logged, and proof of disposition is kept at the end of the retention period.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. When content is labeled as a record, restrictions are put in place, activities are logged, and proof of disposition is kept at the end of the retention period.
    - content: The content is automatically deleted after a certain period.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. Labeling content as a record does not automatically delete it, but puts restrictions and logs activities.
    - content: The content becomes publicly accessible.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. Labeling content as a record does not make it publicly accessible, but imposes restrictions and logs activities.
