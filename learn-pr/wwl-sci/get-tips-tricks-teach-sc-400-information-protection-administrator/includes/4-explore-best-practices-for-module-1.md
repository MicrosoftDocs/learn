Module 1 Tips and Tricks

- Explain how regulation, compliance, and governance requirements are growing more broadly on top of the amount of data expansion 
- Review how data discovery, classification, security, and management is changing with these new challenges and requirements
- Describe the balance between providing secure access and also limiting to just enough operational access to perform duties 
- Clarify data matching elements:
	- Primary pattern
	- Additional evidence
	- Character proximity 
	- Confidence level
- Review special features of sensitive information types:
	- Exact Data Match (EDM)
	- Document fingerprinting
- Keyword dictionaries
