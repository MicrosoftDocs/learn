Understanding posture tells you _where_ risk exists. The next challenge is deciding what to do about it.

In complex environments, risk signals don't arrive neatly grouped. They come from different tools, cover different workloads, and vary in urgency. Looking at each signal in isolation makes it hard to decide where to start or how to measure progress.

Data security objectives exist to solve that problem.

## Objectives as outcome-driven workflows

In data security posture management (DSPM), objectives are the primary way risk is organized and addressed. An objective represents a specific outcome related to data security, like reducing oversharing, limiting exposure, or strengthening protection for sensitive data.

Objectives aren't checklists or static views. They function as workflows that connect:

- Assessing current posture
- Identifying gaps or risks
- Recommending actions
- Validating and reporting over time

This structure shifts the focus away from individual settings or alerts and toward measurable improvement.

## How objectives group assessment, action, and reporting

Each objective brings together information that would otherwise be spread across multiple solutions.

Instead of separately reviewing posture insights, policy gaps, and follow-up actions, objectives present these elements in context. You can see:

- why an objective exists
- what signals are contributing to it
- which actions are recommended
- how changes affect posture over time

This grouping reduces the need to manually connect information across tools and makes it easier to understand how individual actions contribute to broader risk reduction.

## Why objectives replace navigating individual solutions

Traditional workflows often require moving between multiple Purview solutions to understand a single risk area. That approach works for targeted tasks, but it doesn’t scale well when risk spans data types, workloads, and usage patterns.

Objectives provide a higher-level entry point by shifting focus:

- From individual tools to outcomes
- From isolated signals to grouped context
- From reactive navigation to prioritized action

The underlying solutions are still used to take action. Objectives change how they're navigated and why they're used.

## Tracking progress and improvement over time

Because objectives are tied to posture, they support tracking progress over time rather than validating one-time changes.

As actions are taken and conditions change, objectives reflect whether risk is decreasing, staying the same, or shifting elsewhere. This makes it easier to evaluate whether effort is leading to meaningful improvement or simply addressing symptoms.

Progress is measured through trends and posture signals, not by checking whether a single recommendation was completed.

## Objectives that address AI-related risk

Some objectives explicitly focus on risks introduced or amplified by AI usage. These might relate to exposure through prompts, oversharing in responses, or movement of sensitive data through AI-driven workflows.

These objectives treat AI activity as part of the broader data security landscape. Signals from AI interactions are evaluated alongside more traditional signals, like access and sharing, rather than being handled in isolation.

## Why AI-related objectives aren't separate from data security

AI-related risk doesn't replace existing data risk. It builds on it.

Sensitive data that's poorly classified, widely accessible, or inconsistently protected becomes more exposed when used in AI interactions. Objectives reflect this reality by connecting AI-related signals to the same posture model used for other data risks.

This approach avoids treating AI as a special case. Instead, it reinforces that strong data security fundamentals are what make AI usage safer and more predictable.
