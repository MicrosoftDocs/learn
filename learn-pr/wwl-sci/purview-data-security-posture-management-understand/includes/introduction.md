Data security work often starts in the middle. Teams respond to alerts, investigate activity, and adjust policies based on what surfaces in individual tools. What's harder to answer is a more basic question: **where is the organization most exposed right now, and why**.

When sensitive data is spread across workloads, widely accessible, or actively used through AI-driven experiences, isolated signals don't provide enough context to guide decisions. Without a clear view of posture, teams might spend effort in the wrong places or react to symptoms instead of underlying risk.

Data security posture management exists to solve this problem. It helps teams understand where sensitive data exists, how it’s being used, and how consistently it's protected. This context helps direct effort intentionally before configuring controls or launching investigations.

## Learning objectives

By the end of this module, you'll be able to:

- Explain what data security posture management is and the problem it addresses
- Describe how posture is evaluated over time
- Explain how data security objectives organize risk into outcomes
- Describe the role of AI in data security posture management
- Explain how data security posture management fits with data loss prevention (DLP), Insider Risk Management, audit, and investigations
