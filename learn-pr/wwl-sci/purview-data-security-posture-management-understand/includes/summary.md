Understanding data security posture management starts with understanding its role. It doesn't enforce policies, investigate incidents, or replace existing security tools. It provides the visibility and context needed to decide where those tools should be applied and why.

In this module, you learned how to:

- Explain what data security posture management is and the problem it addresses
- Describe how posture is evaluated over time
- Explain how data security objectives organize risk into outcomes
- Describe the role of AI in data security posture management
- Explain how data security posture management fits with data loss prevention (DLP), Insider Risk Management, audit, and investigations

Without this understanding, teams might react to isolated findings, focus effort in the wrong areas, or miss patterns that indicate broader exposure. Using posture as a starting point helps align protection, investigation, and validation around real data risk as conditions change.

This foundation prepares you to apply controls, investigate activity, and evaluate outcomes with clearer intent, using Microsoft Purview tools in a way that stays focused on what matters most.
