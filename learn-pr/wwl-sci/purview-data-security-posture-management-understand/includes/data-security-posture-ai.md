AI plays a supporting role inside data security posture management (DSPM). It doesn't replace human judgment or take action on its own. Its purpose is to help make sense of complex signals at scale.

This distinction matters. Trust in DSPM depends on understanding where AI assists and where control remains firmly with people and policies.

## Where AI fits in DSPM

DSPM uses AI capabilities like Security Copilot and embedded agents to help analyze information that would otherwise be difficult to interpret manually.

These capabilities operate within DSPM’s posture and objectives, rather than alongside them. They don't introduce new sources of authority or bypass existing controls. Instead, they help surface insights from posture data, objectives, and signals that are already available.

AI is used to support understanding, not to decide outcomes.

## What AI assists with

Within DSPM, AI assists with tasks that benefit from pattern recognition and contextual analysis, including:

- Triage of posture signals and objective-related findings
- Prioritization of risks based on patterns, trends, and scope
- Analysis that explains why certain risks surface and how they relate to posture

These capabilities reduce the time spent interpreting data and connecting signals across tools. They don't change what actions are available or how those actions are taken.

## What AI doesn't do

AI inside DSPM doesn't perform autonomous enforcement.

It doesn't:

- Create or modify policies on its own
- Block access or take corrective action without approval
- Replace investigation or enforcement tools

All actions still occur in the appropriate Microsoft Purview solution and follow existing permission models. AI might suggest or explain, but it doesn't execute.

This boundary is intentional and central to how DSPM is designed.

## Approval, auditing, and transparency

Any AI-assisted insight or recommendation is visible and reviewable.

DSPM maintains transparency around:

- How conclusions are formed
- Which signals contribute to recommendations
- What actions are suggested versus required

Actions taken in response to DSPM insights are still auditable through the underlying tools. This ensures accountability and supports review, validation, and governance processes.

AI assists with clarity, not control.

## Why trust and control matter

As environments grow more complex, especially with increased AI usage, the volume of signals can overwhelm traditional workflows. AI helps manage that complexity, but only when its role is clearly defined.

DSPM uses AI to support informed decision-making while preserving control, approval, and accountability. This balance allows AI to accelerate understanding without changing who owns risk decisions or how they're enforced.
