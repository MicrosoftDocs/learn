With more sophisticated adversaries and new threats emerging frequently and prevalently, it's critical to be able to quickly:

- Assess the impact of new threats

- Review your resilience against or exposure to the threats

- Identify the actions you can take to stop or contain the threats

Threat analytics is a set of reports from expert Microsoft security researchers covering the most relevant threats, including:

- Active threat actors and their campaigns

- Popular and new attack techniques

- Critical vulnerabilities

- Common attack surfaces

- Prevalent malware

Each report provides a detailed analysis of a threat and extensive guidance on how to defend against that threat. It also incorporates data from your network, indicating whether the threat is active and if you have applicable protections in place.

## View the threat analytics dashboard

The threat analytics dashboard is a great jump-off point for getting to the reports that are most relevant to your organization. It summarizes the threats in the following sections:

Latest threats—lists the most recently published threat reports, along with the number of devices with active and resolved alerts.

High-impact threats—lists the threats that have had the highest impact on the organization. This section ranks threats by the number of devices that have active alerts.

Threat summary—shows the overall impact of tracked threats by showing the number of threats with active and resolved alerts.

Select a threat from the dashboard to view the report for that threat.

## View a threat analytics report

Each threat analytics report provides information in three sections: Overview, Analyst report, and Mitigations.

The Overview section provides a preview of the detailed analyst report. It also provides charts that highlight the impact of the threat to your organization and your exposure through misconfigured and unpatched devices.

### Assess the impact on your organization

Each report includes charts designed to provide information about the organizational impact of a threat:

- Devices with alerts—shows the current number of distinct devices that have been impacted by the threat. A device is categorized as Active if there is at least one alert associated with that threat and Resolved if all alerts associated with the threat on the device have been resolved.

- Devices with alerts over time—shows the number of distinct devices with Active and Resolved alerts over time. The number of resolved alerts indicates how quickly your organization responds to alerts associated with a threat. Ideally, the chart should be showing alerts resolved within a few days.

### Review security resilience and posture

Each report includes charts that provide an overview of how resilient your organization is against a given threat:

- Security configuration status—shows the number of devices that have applied the recommended security settings that can help mitigate the threat. Devices are considered Secure if they have applied all the tracked settings.

- Vulnerability patching status—shows the number of devices that have applied security updates or patches that address vulnerabilities exploited by the threat.

### Mitigations: Review list of mitigations and the status of your devices

In the Mitigations section, review the list of specific, actionable recommendations that can help you increase your organizational resilience against the threat. The list of tracked mitigations includes:

- Security updates—deployment of security updates or patches for vulnerabilities

- Microsoft Defender Antivirus settings

  - Security intelligence version

  - Cloud-delivered protection

  - Potentially unwanted application (PUA) protection

  - Real-time protection

Mitigation information in this section incorporates data from threat and vulnerability management, which also provides detailed drill-down information from various links in the report.
