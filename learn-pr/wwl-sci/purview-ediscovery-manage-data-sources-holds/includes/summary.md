Scoping an investigation and preserving content are essential steps in Microsoft Purview eDiscovery. Choosing the right data sources ensures the search includes all relevant locations. Applying hold policies protects that content from deletion for the duration of the investigation.

Microsoft Purview helps preserve metadata, applies delay holds when needed, and offers tools to troubleshoot or report on hold status. PowerShell can also be used to confirm whether preservation is working as expected.

In this module, you learned to:

- Identify and configure the content sources used in eDiscovery searches and holds
- Apply tenant-wide or scoped holds based on the needs of an investigation
- Review and adjust existing hold policies as cases progress
- Use PowerShell to verify hold settings and data preservation
