In Microsoft Purview eDiscovery, identifying the right content sources and preserving data are essential steps in responding to legal, regulatory, or internal investigations. Without a clear definition of where to search and what to preserve, organizations risk missing critical evidence or failing to meet compliance obligations.

Defining and managing data sources, applying and maintaining holds, and validating that preservation is working as expected are key parts of managing investigations in Microsoft Purview. This includes support for preserving metadata, applying delay holds after removal, and using tools to troubleshoot or report on hold status.

By the end of this module, you'll be able to:

- Identify the types of data sources used in eDiscovery searches and holds
- Add and manage data sources in the new eDiscovery experience
- Create and configure hold policies to preserve relevant content
- View, edit, and troubleshoot existing holds
- Confirm hold status using PowerShell and interpret preservation behavior
