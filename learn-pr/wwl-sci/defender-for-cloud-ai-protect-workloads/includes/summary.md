A single misconfiguration, like a publicly accessible model, can expose sensitive data or create opportunities for malicious activity. Defender for Cloud provides the visibility and controls needed to detect and prevent these issues before they affect your AI workloads.

In this module, you learned how to:

- Enable the AI workloads plan to discover AI resources and configurations
- Use the Data & AI security dashboard to view posture and sensitive data insights
- Apply CSPM recommendations to remediate misconfigurations and strengthen defenses
- Detect runtime threats such as prompt injections or data exfiltration with CWP
- Investigate AI-related alerts and incidents in Microsoft Defender XDR

Through posture management, runtime detection, and investigation capabilities, Defender for Cloud gives you the visibility and control to identify, contain, and resolve AI security issues quickly. The next time a developer leaves a model endpoint exposed, youâ€™ll have the tools to detect it, understand the risk, and respond effectively.
