Contoso Ltd. recently deployed an AI model that uses Azure OpenAI and Azure AI Search to assist employees with internal documentation. During testing, a developer accidentally left the model's endpoint publicly accessible. The security team must use Microsoft Defender for Cloud to discover the exposure, assess risks, detect any threats, and investigate alerts related to this misconfiguration.
