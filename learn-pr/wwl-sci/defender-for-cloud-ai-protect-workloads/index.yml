title: Protect AI workloads with Microsoft Defender for Cloud

summary: |
  Microsoft Defender for Cloud helps secure AI workloads by combining discovery, posture management, and runtime protection in one platform.
  You'll learn how to enable the AI workloads plan, review insights in the Data & AI security dashboard, assess posture using Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM), detect runtime threats with Cloud Workload Protection (CWP), and investigate incidents in Microsoft Defender XDR.
  These capabilities work together to identify configuration gaps, detect suspicious behavior, and provide end-to-end visibility across your AI environments.
