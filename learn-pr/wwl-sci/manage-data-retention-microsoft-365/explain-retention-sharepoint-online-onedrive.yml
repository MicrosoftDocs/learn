  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "How does retention work for OneNote content stored in SharePoint and OneDrive?"
    choices:
    - content: "Each OneNote section is stored as a separate file and retained individually under the policy."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct: OneNote notebooks are stored as folders, and each section is a separate file. Retention policies apply to the section files individually, meaning all pages within a section are retained or deleted together."
    - content: "Retention policies treat the entire notebook as a single unit."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect: Retention policies apply to individual section files, not to the notebook as a whole."
    - content: "Retention is based on the Modified date of the entire notebook."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect: The Modified date shown for the notebook doesn't affect retention. Retention is based on the section files, which are the actual files managed by the policy."
