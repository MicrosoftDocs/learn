As a security engineer working for Contoso, you recently noticed that a significant number of VMs have been deleted from your Azure subscription. You want to analyze this  occurrence and be alerted when a similar activity occurs in the future. You decide to implement an analytics rule to create an incident when someone deletes an existing VM.

## Exercise: Threat detection with Microsoft Sentinel Analytics

In this exercise, you'll explore a Microsoft Sentinel analytics rule and perform the following tasks:

- Create an incident rule from an existing template.
- Invoke an incident and review the associated actions.
- Create an analytics rule from a rule template.

> [!NOTE]
> In order to complete this exercise, you must have completed **Exercise Setup unit** in Unit 2. If you have not done so, complete it now, and then continue with the exercise steps.

### Task 1: Create an analytics rule from the analytics rule wizard

1. In the Azure portal, search for and select **Microsoft Sentinel**, and then select the previously created Microsoft Sentinel workspace.
1. On the **Microsoft Sentinel** menu, under **Configuration** , select **Analytics**.
1. On the **Microsoft Sentinel | Analytics** header bar, select **Create** and then select **Scheduled query rule**.
1. On the **General** tab, enter the input values in the following table, and then select  **Next: Set rule logic**

    | Name | Azure VM Deletion. |
    | --- | --- |
    | Description | A simple detection to alert when someone deletes Azure Virtual Machine. |
    | Tactics | From the **Tactics** drop-down menu, select Impact. |
    | Severity | Select the **Severity** drop-down menu select Medium. |
    | Status | Ensure the status is **Enabled**. You can select **Disabled** to disable a rule if it generates large numbers of false positives. |

1. On the **Set rule logic** tab, copy and paste the following code into the **Rule query** text box:

    ```kusto
    AzureActivity
    | where OperationNameValue == "MICROSOFT.COMPUTE/VIRTUALMACHINES/DELETE"
    | where ActivityStatusValue == "Success"
    ```

1. In the **Results simulation** pane, select **Test with current data**, and then observe the results.

1. In the **Alert enhancement** section under **Entity Mapping**, map the entities that are returned as part of the query rule and that you can use to perform in-depth analysis.
1. In the **Query Scheduling** section, configure how often the query should run, and how far in history to search. Select query to run on every 5 minutes, and accept the default history of 5 hours.
1. In the **Alert threshold** section, specify the number of positive results that can be returned for the rule before an alert gets generated. Accept the default values.
1. In the **Event grouping** section, accept the default **Group all events into a single alert.**
1. In the **Suppression** section, set **Stop running the Query after the alert is generated** to  **On**.
1. Accept the default values of 5 hours and then select **Next: Incident setting (Preview)**.
1. In the **Incident setting** tab, ensure that **Enabled** is selected for creation of incidents from alerts triggered by this analytics rule.
1. In the **Alert grouping** section, select **Enabled** to group related alerts into incidents, and ensure that **Grouping alerts into a single incident if all the entities match (recommended)** is selected.
1. Ensure that **Reopen closed matching incidents** is **Disabled**, and then select **Next: Automated response**.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/07-incident-settings.png" alt-text="Screenshot Analytics Incident Settings." border="true":::

1. In the **Automated response**  pane, select a playbook to run automatically when the alert is generated. Only the playbooks that contain Logic App Microsoft Sentinel connector are displayed.
1. Select **Next: Review**.
1. In the **Review and create** page, verify that the validation was successful, and then select **Save**.

### Task 2: Invoke an incident and review the associated actions

1. In the Azure portal, select **Home** and in the **Search** omnibox, enter **virtual machines**, and then select **Enter**.
2. On the **Virtual machines** page, locate and select the **simple-vm** virtual machine that you created in the resource group for this exercise, and then on the header bar, select **Delete**. In the Delete virtual machine prompt, select **Yes**.
3. In the **Delete virtual machine** prompt, select **OK** to delete the virtual machine.

> [!Note]
> This task creates an incident based on the analytics rule that you created in Task 1. Incident creation can take up to 15 minutes. You can proceed with rest of the steps of this unit and then observe the results at later time.

### Task 3: Create an analytics rule from an existing template

1. In the Azure portal, select **Home**, select Microsoft Sentinel, and, then select the Microsoft Sentinel workspace you created in the Unit 2 of this module.

1. Open **Microsoft Sentinel**, in the left menu under **Configuration**, select **Analytics**.

1. On the **Analytics** pane, select **Rule templates** tab.

1. In the search field, enter **Create incidents based on Microsoft Defender for Cloud** and then select that rule template.

1. In the details pane, select **Create rule**.

1. In the **General** pane, observe the name of the analytics rule, and verify that the **Status** of the rule is **Enabled**.

1. In the **Analytics rule logic** section, verify that the Microsoft security service shows **Microsoft Defender for Cloud** is selected.

1. In the **Filter by severity** section, select **Custom**, and then in the drop-down menu, select **High** and **Medium**.

1. If you want additional filters for the alerts from Microsoft Defender for Cloud, you can add text in **Include specific alerts** and **Exclude specific alerts**.

1. Select **Next: Automated response** and then select **Next: Review**.

1. On the **Review and Create** page, select **Create**.

### Results

After completing this exercise, you'll have created an incident rule from an existing template and created a scheduled query rule using your own query code.

After you've finished with the exercise, you should delete resources to avoid incurring costs.

### Clean up the resources

1. In the Azure portal, search for **Resource groups**.
1. Select **azure-sentinel-rg**.
1. On the header bar, select **Delete resource group**.
1. In the **TYPE THE RESOURCE GROUP NAME:** field, enter the name of the resource group **azure-sentinel-rg** and select **Delete**.
