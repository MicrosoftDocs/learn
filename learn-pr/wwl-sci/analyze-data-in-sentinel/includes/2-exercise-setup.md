The Threat detection with Microsoft Sentinel Analytics exercise in this module is an optional unit. However, if you want to perform this exercise, you need access to an Azure subscription where you can create Azure resources. If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?azure-portal=true) before you begin.

To deploy the prerequisites for the exercise, perform the following tasks.

> [!NOTE]
> If you choose to perform the exercise in this module, be aware you might incur costs in your Azure Subscription. To estimate the cost, refer to [Microsoft Sentinel Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/azure-sentinel/).

## Task 1: Deploy Microsoft Sentinel using ARM template

1. Select the following link:

    [![Deploy To Azure.](https://aka.ms/deploytoazurebutton)](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FMicrosoftDocs%2Fmslearn-security-ops-sentinel%2Fmain%2Fmslearn-analyze-data-in-sentinel%2Fsentinel-template.json?azure-portal=true)

    You're prompted to sign in to Azure. The **Custom deployment** pane appears.

1. On the **Basics** tab, enter the following values for each setting.

    | Setting | Value |
    |---|---|
    | **Project details** |
    | Subscription | Select your Azure subscription. |
    | Resource group | Select **Create new**, and provide a name for the resource group, such as `azure-sentinel-rg`.|
    | **Instance details** |
    | Region | From the dropdown list, select the location where you want to deploy the Microsoft Sentinel. |
    | Workspace Name  | Provide a unique name for the Microsoft Sentinel Workspace such as `<yourName>-sentinel`, where *\<yourName>* represents the workspace name that you chose in the previous task. |
    | Location | Accept the default value of **[resourceGroup().location]**. |
    | Simplevm Name | Accept the default value of **simple-vm**. |
    | Simplevm Windows OS Version | Accept the default value of **2016-Datacenter**. |

1. Select the **Review + create**. When validation passes, select **Create**.

    > [!Note]
    > Wait for the deployment to complete. The deployment should take less than five minutes.

## Task 2: Check the resources created

1. In the Azure portal, search for **Resource groups**.

1. Select **azure-sentinel-rg**.

1. Sort the list of resources by **Type**.

    The resource group should contain the resources listed in the following table.

    | Name  | Type  | Description |
    |---|---|---|
    | `<yourName>-sentinel` | Log Analytics workspace | Log Analytics workspace used by Microsoft Sentinel, where *\<yourName>* represents the workspace name that you chose in the previous task. |
    | `simple-vmNetworkInterface` | Network interface | Network interface for the VM. |
    | `SecurityInsights(<yourName>-sentinel)` | Solution | Security insights for Microsoft Sentinel. |
    | `simple-vm` | Virtual machine | Virtual machine (VM) used in the demonstration. |
    | `st1<xxxxx>` | Storage account | Storage account used by the VM, where *\<xxxxx>* represents a random string generated to create a unique storage account name. |
    | `vnet1` | Virtual network | Virtual network for the VM. |

> [!NOTE]
> The resources deployed and configuration steps completed in this exercise are required in the next exercise. If you intended to complete the next exercise, don't delete the resources from this exercise.

## Task 3: Configure Microsoft Sentinel Data connectors

In this task, you deploy a Microsoft Sentinel Data connector to detect Azure Activity.

1. In the Azure portal, select **Home**, and then search for and select **Microsoft Sentinel**.

1. In the list of Sentinel workspace names, select the Microsoft Sentinel workspace you created in Task 2. The **Overview** pane for your Sentinel workspace appears.

1. In the menu pane, under **Content management**, select **Content hub**. The **Content hub** pane appears.

1. In the *Search* box, search for and select the **Azure Activity** Solution. On the **Azure Activity** details pane, select **Install**.

1. Wait for the install to complete and them select **Manage**.

1. In the *Search* box, search for and select the **Azure Activity** Data connector. 

1. On the **Azure Activity** details pane, select **Open connector page**.

1. In the *Instructions* tab, *Configuration* area, scroll down and under "2. Connect your subscriptions..." select **Launch Azure Policy Assignment Wizard>**.

1. In the **Basics** tab, select the ellipsis button (...) under **Scope** and select your "Azure subscription" from the drop-down list and select **Select**.

1. Select the **Parameters** tab, choose your *yourName-sentinel* workspace from the **Primary Log Analytics workspace** drop-down list.

1. Select the **Remediation** tab and select the **Create a remediation task** checkbox. This action applies the subscription configuration to send the information to the Log Analytics workspace.

   > [!NOTE]
   > To apply the policy to your existing resources, you need to create a remediation task.

1. Select the **Review + Create** button to review the configuration.

1. Select **Create** to finish.

1. Once the deployment is complete, you'll see the **Connected** status (green bar) for the Azure Activity connector in the *Configuration/Data connectors* pane.
