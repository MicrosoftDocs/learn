Investigations that involve user data across Microsoft 365 can quickly become complex. After collecting search results, information security and legal teams need a consistent way to analyze and prepare that content. Reviewing data one item at a time is inefficient and can introduce risk. You need a workspace that supports structured review and defensible outcomes.

Imagine you're handling a compliance case with thousands of emails, files, and chats. You need to isolate relevant items, apply legal review tags, run analytics to reduce redundancy, and prepare key documents for export. Without a way to organize this work, the process can stall or produce inconsistent results.

This module shows how to manage content using review sets in Microsoft Purview eDiscovery. You'll create review sets, add and organize items, apply filters and tags, use analytics to prioritize review, and export or reuse data for further action.

In this module, you learn how to:

- Create and populate review sets
- Search, filter, group, and tag review set items
- Run analytics and apply built-in filters
- Export or reuse content across review sets

By the end, you'll know how to manage and work with review set content in a way that supports fast, consistent, and defensible investigations.
