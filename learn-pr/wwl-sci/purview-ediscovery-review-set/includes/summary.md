In this module, you managed case content using Microsoft Purview eDiscovery review sets. You created and populated review sets, applied filters and tags to focus review, and used grouping and viewing options to better understand document context. You also ran analytics to reduce volume, used filters to prioritize review, and exported or reused content for further analysis.

Without review sets, investigations would require manual effort to organize and track documents, increasing the risk of errors or delays. It would be harder to maintain a consistent review process, especially when collaborating with other stakeholders.

In this module, you learned how to:

- Create and populate review sets
- Search, filter, group, and tag review set items
- Run analytics and apply built-in filters
- Export or reuse content across review sets

By using review sets, legal and compliance teams can work more efficiently and support investigations with a repeatable, auditable process that scales with the scope of the case.
