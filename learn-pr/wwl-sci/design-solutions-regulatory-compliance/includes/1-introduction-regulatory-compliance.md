As organizations expand across regions and adopt new technologies like AI, they face an increasingly complex web of regulatory requirements. Security architects must design solutions that not only protect assets but also demonstrate compliance with regulations that vary by geography, industry, and technology.

## What is regulatory compliance?

Regulatory compliance refers to the discipline of ensuring that an organization follows the laws enforced by governing bodies in their geography or rules required by voluntarily adopted industry standards. For security architects, this means designing solutions that:

- Meet specific technical and operational requirements mandated by regulations
- Provide evidence of compliance through logging, monitoring, and reporting
- Adapt to changing requirements as regulations evolve
- Scale across multicloud and hybrid environments

Compliance is particularly challenging for multinational organizations in regulated industries like healthcare and financial services, where requirements vary by jurisdiction and change frequently.

## Scenario

You're a security architect at Contoso, a multinational financial services company. Contoso recently expanded operations into new markets and is deploying AI-powered services for customer interactions. Your leadership team has tasked you with designing a compliance strategy that addresses:

- Financial services regulations across multiple regions
- Healthcare data protection requirements for a new insurance product line
- AI governance requirements as the company deploys machine learning models
- Privacy requirements for customer data across all services
- Consistent policy enforcement across Azure, AWS, and on-premises environments

You need to translate these diverse regulatory requirements into a cohesive security architecture that enables the business while maintaining compliance.
