In this module, you learned how to design security solutions that address regulatory compliance requirements across multicloud environments.

You learned how to:

- Translate compliance requirements into security solutions using Zero Trust principles and the Cloud Adoption Framework Govern methodology
- Identify compliance considerations for AI deployments, including emerging regulations like the EU AI Act and ISO 42001
- Design solutions using Microsoft Purview to address data protection, audit, and compliance requirements
- Design privacy solutions using Microsoft Priva for risk management and subject rights requests
- Design Azure Policy solutions that enforce compliance through preventive, detective, and corrective controls
- Evaluate compliance posture across Azure, AWS, and GCP using Microsoft Defender for Cloud
