Imagine that you're a security engineer for Contoso, Ltd., a midsize financial services company in London with a New York branch office. Contoso uses the following Microsoft security management products:

- Microsoft 365
- Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)
- Azure AD Identity Protection
- Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps
- Microsoft Defender for Identity
- Microsoft Defender for Endpoint
- Microsoft Defender for Office 365
- Intune Endpoint Protection
- Azure Information Protection

Contoso uses Microsoft Defender for Cloud as threat protection for resources that run on Azure and on-premises. The company also monitors and protects other non-Microsoft assets.

Recently, the company's Azure Activity log showed that a significant number of VMs were deleted from the Azure subscription. You need to analyze this occurrence and be alerted when similar activity occurs in the future.

Microsoft Sentinel is a cloud application that can help you protect Contoso's resources. In this module, you learn how to use Microsoft Sentinel to create and investigate an incident when a Contoso user deletes an existing VM.
