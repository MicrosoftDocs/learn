    | Display name                                                                    | Adele Vance |
    | Password                                                                        | Pass@word1  |

5. Select **Create**. The user is now created and registered to your organization.

## Assign a role to a user

Using Microsoft Entra ID, you can designate limited administrators to manage identity tasks in less-privileged roles. Administrators can be assigned for such purposes as adding or changing users, assigning administrative roles, resetting user passwords, managing user licenses, and managing domain names.

1. In Microsoft Entra ID, All users screen, select **Adele Vance**.
2. On the **user’s profile** page, select **Assigned roles**. The **Assigned roles** page appears.
3. Select **Add assignments**, select the role to assign to the user (for example, *Application administrator*), and then select **Add**.

The newly assigned Application administrator role appears on the user’s **Assigned roles** page.

## Remove a role assignment

If you need to remove the role assignment from a user, you can also do that from the **Assigned roles** page.

### To remove a role assignment from a user

1. In Microsoft Entra ID, select **Users - All User**, and then select the user getting the role assignment removed. For example, *Adele Vance*.
2. Select **Assigned roles**, then select the name of the role your wish to removed - `Application Administrator`.
3. On the far right side of the screen, select **Remove**. Then select **Yes** option when prompted for confirmation.
    
   :::image type="content" source="../media/directory-role-remove-role.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Remove assignments dialog box with Yes highlighted.":::
