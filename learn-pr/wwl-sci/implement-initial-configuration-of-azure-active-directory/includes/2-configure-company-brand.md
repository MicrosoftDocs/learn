You can use your organization's logo and custom color schemes to provide a consistent experience on your sign-in pages. Your sign-in pages appear when users sign in to your organization's web-based apps, such as Microsoft 365, which uses Microsoft Entra ID as your identity provider. Adding custom branding requires you to have either **Microsoft Entra ID premium P1, P2, or Office 365 (for Office 365 apps)** license.

To set the company branding, open up the Microsoft Entra ID page in the Azure portal. Then launch **Company branding** from the Manage menu. If you do not have the proper premium license the menu option will not be present.
