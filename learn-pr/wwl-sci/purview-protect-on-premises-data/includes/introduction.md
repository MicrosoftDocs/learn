Many organizations continue to rely on on-premises storage like file shares and SharePoint Server to manage business-critical information. While Microsoft Purview provides strong protection for cloud-based content, protecting data at rest in on-premises environments requires extra setup.

In this module, you take on the role of an information security administrator responsible for extending sensitivity labeling, encryption, and data loss prevention (DLP) to on-premises content. Using the Microsoft Purview Information Protection scanner, you configure, install, and run scans to classify and protect sensitive data stored in local repositories.

In this module, you:

- Prepare your environment and verify scanner prerequisites
- Configure scanner settings, content scan jobs, and policy enforcement
- Install and authenticate the scanner service
- Run scans in discovery or enforcement mode
- Use DLP rules to detect sensitive content and automatically restrict access

By the end of this module, you'll be able to deploy the scanner, apply labels and DLP actions to local files, and monitor results using built-in reporting and activity tools.
