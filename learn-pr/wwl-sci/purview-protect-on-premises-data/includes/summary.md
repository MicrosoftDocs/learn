Extending data protection to on-premises environments helps close security and compliance gaps for sensitive content stored outside the cloud. The Microsoft Purview Information Protection scanner brings unified labeling, encryption, and data loss prevention (DLP) policy enforcement to file shares and SharePoint Server libraries.

In this module, you learned how to:

- Prepare your scanner infrastructure, including servers, permissions, and licensing
 Configure content scan jobs to support labeling and DLP enforcement
- Install and authenticate the scanner with Microsoft Entra ID
- Run discovery and enforcement scans to classify and protect files
- Monitor scanner activity using scan reports, audit logs, and Activity explorer

With the scanner in place, your organization can consistently apply Microsoft Purview labeling and DLP policies across hybrid environments. This supports data protection, regulatory compliance, and internal risk management goals.
