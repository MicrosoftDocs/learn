  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "Your organization has deployed Microsoft 365 applications to all employees. Who is responsible for the security of the personal data relating to your employees?"
    choices:
    - content: "Your organization."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. In the shared responsibility model, the customer organization always has responsibility for their data, including personal data relating to employees."
    - content: "Microsoft, the SaaS provider."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The shared responsibility model shows that Microsoft as the cloud provider is responsible for hardware the applications run on, the cloud customer is responsible for data, including personal data."
    - content: "The shared responsibility between your organization and Microsoft."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The shared responsibility model shows that the cloud customer always retains responsibility for data, including personal data."
  - content: "Your organization has adopted the defense in-depth security methodology. Which of the following measures might you implement?"
    choices:
    - content: "Locating servers at different locations in your organization."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Defense in-depth requires layered security, including physical security. Locating servers at different locations in your organization makes it difficult to provide adequate physical security."
    - content: "Multi-factor authentication for all users."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Multi-factor authentication is an example of defense in-depth at the identity and access layer."
    - content: "Ensuring there's no segmentation of your corporate network."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Splitting a network up into multiple sub-networks provides better layered security and is an example of defense in depth at the network layer."
  - content: "You've been advised that your department must protect employee training data. Which security mechanism would you use?"
    choices:
    - content: "Hashing."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's  incorrect. Hashing uses a one-way algorithm to store data in an encrypted state. However, you would not be able to read the employee training data, making it an unsuitable method to protect the data."
    - content: "Digital signing."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Digital signing is a mechanism to show that a message has come from the correct sender, and has not been tampered with, making it an inappropriate method to protect the data."
    - content: "Encryption at rest."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Encryption at rest could be part of a security strategy to protect employee training data."
