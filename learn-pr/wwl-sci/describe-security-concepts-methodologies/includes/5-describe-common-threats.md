There are different types of security threats. Some aim to steal data, some aim to <!--CE: I think this is meant to say 'extort'-->exhort money, and others to disrupt normal operations, such as a denial of service attack. This unit looks at some of the common threats.

## Data breach

A data breach is when data is stolen, and this includes personal data. Personal data means any information related to an individual that can be used to identify them directly or indirectly.

Common security threats that can result in a breach of personal data include phishing, spear phishing, tech support scams, SQL injection, and malware designed to steal passwords or bank details.

### Dictionary attack

A dictionary attack is a type of identity attack where a hacker attempts to steal an identity by trying a large number of known passwords. Each password is automatically tested against a known username. Dictionary attacks are also known as brute force attacks.

### Ransomware

Malware is the term used to describe malicious applications and code that can cause damage and disrupt normal use of devices. Malware can give attackers unauthorized access, which allows them to use system resources, lock you out of your computer, and ask for ransom.

Ransomware is a type of malware that encrypts files and folders, preventing access to important files. Ransomware attempts to extort money from victims, usually in the form of cryptocurrencies, in exchange for the decryption key.

Cybercriminals that distribute malware are often motivated by money and will use infected computers to launch attacks, obtain banking credentials, collect information that can be sold, sell access to computing resources, or extort payment from victims.

### Disruptive attacks

A Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack attempts to exhaust an application's resources, making the application unavailable to legitimate users. DDoS attacks can be targeted at any endpoint that is publicly reachable through the internet.

Other common threats include coin miners, rootkits, trojans, worms, and exploits and exploit kits. Rootkits intercept and change standard operating system processes. After a rootkit infects a device, you can’t trust any information that the device reports about itself.

Trojans are a common type of malware, which, unlike viruses, can’t spread on their own. This means they either have to be downloaded manually or another malware needs to download and install them. Trojans often use the same file names as real and legitimate apps so it's easy to accidentally download a trojan thinking that it is legitimate.

A worm is a type of malware that can copy itself and often spreads through a network by exploiting security vulnerabilities. It can spread through email attachments, text messages, file-sharing programs, social networking sites, network shares, removable drives, and software vulnerabilities.

Exploits take advantage of vulnerabilities in software. A vulnerability is like a hole in your software that malware uses to get onto your device. Malware exploits these vulnerabilities to bypass your computer's security safeguards and infect your device.

These examples are just a few of the threats commonly seen. This is a continually evolving area and new threats emerge all the time.
