Now that you’ve completed the case study, reflect on how the architectural decisions made in the simulation compare to practices within your own organization. Consider how your teams manage application security across cloud platforms, and evaluate opportunities to strengthen DevSecOps maturity through consistent policy enforcement, federated identity management, and centralized threat detection.

Think about:

- How secrets and credentials are handled across environments.
- Whether your CI/CD pipelines integrate security early in the development lifecycle.
- How well your monitoring tools correlate signals across runtime, infrastructure, and code.
- What governance gaps exist between cloud platforms—and how they impact visibility and control.

Use this reflection to identify areas where your organization can improve its cloud-native security posture and align more closely with Zero Trust principles.

In this case study module, you:

- Explored risks related to application code, CI/CD pipelines, and cloud configuration drift.
- Learned how these challenges align with Zero Trust principles and DevSecOps best practices.
- Applied architectural reasoning to assess threats and design secure, scalable solutions for multicloud environments.
