In this case study module, you:

- Explore risks related to application code, CI/CD pipelines, and cloud configuration drift.
- Learn how these challenges align with Zero Trust principles and DevSecOps best practices.
- Apply architectural reasoning to assess threats and design secure, scalable solutions for multicloud environments.
