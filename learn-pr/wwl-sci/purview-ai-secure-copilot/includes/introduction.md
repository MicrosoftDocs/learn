Microsoft 365 Copilot enables new ways to access and interact with organizational data, but it also introduces new risks. Prompts might expose sensitive content, and AI-generated responses can lead to unintended data sharing or compliance violations.

In this module, you take on the role of a security or compliance administrator responsible for securing AI interactions in Microsoft 365. You'll use Microsoft Purview to protect data accessed by Copilot, enforce appropriate use policies, and support compliance with regulatory requirements.

In this module, you:

- Control Copilot's access to sensitive content with sensitivity labels
- Prevent data exposure in Copilot interactions using data loss prevention policies
- Retain and audit Copilot prompts and responses with retention and audit
- Investigate Copilot activity using eDiscovery
- Detect risky or inappropriate Copilot usage with Communication Compliance
- Assess AI compliance using Compliance Manager

By the end of this module, you'll know how to use Microsoft Purview to secure AI interactions across Microsoft 365.
