Microsoft 365 Copilot makes it easier for people to interact with data through natural language prompts. These interactions can also introduce the risk of sharing sensitive or inappropriate information. Communication Compliance lets you analyze prompt and response content from Copilot to detect these risks.

Communication Compliance supports in-app Copilot experiences across Microsoft 365 apps like Teams, Outlook, and Word. It can detect potential issues in prompts submitted by users or responses generated by Copilot. These matches are flagged for review by authorized investigators.

This lets your organization identify and respond to inappropriate behavior, risky language, or sensitive data exposure in Copilot interactions while continuing to support productivity.

## Analyze Copilot interactions with Communication Compliance

Communication Compliance uses message metadata to detect Copilot interactions across Microsoft 365 apps. These include messages that use the `IPM.SkypeTeams.Message.Copilot.*` item class, such as Copilot for Teams or Copilot for Outlook.

You can create a policy that includes Microsoft 365 Copilot and set conditions to detect:

- Use of sensitive information types
- Specific keywords or trainable classifiers
- Prompts or responses that match content safety classifiers

Each matching prompt or response is surfaced in the **Pending** tab of the Communication Compliance policy. You can investigate and remediate the match like any other message. Reviewers can tag, resolve, escalate, download, or export the item as needed.

## Create a Communication Compliance policy for Copilot

To analyze Copilot interactions:

1. In the Microsoft Purview portal, go to **Solutions** > **Communication Compliance**.
1. Select **Policies**, then select **Create policy**.
1. Choose the **Detect Microsoft Copilot interactions** template.

1. Name your policy, choose users and groups, and assign reviewers.
1. Review the settings, then create the policy or choose to customize it before saving.

When creating or editing a Communication Compliance policy, you can customize how it applies to AI tools and review conditions:

- Select **Microsoft Copilot experiences** as a location, even if you're not using the Copilot-specific policy template.
- Add additional locations such as **Enterprise AI apps** and **Other AI apps** to include connected or browser-based tools.
- Adjust the review percentage to control how often Copilot interactions are flagged for review.
- Customize or remove default conditions based on your organization's needs.

> [!NOTE]
> There's no charge for detecting interactions from Microsoft 365 Copilot and Microsoft Copilot Studio. Pay-as-you-go billing applies only when you enable detection for **Enterprise AI apps** and **Other AI apps**.

## Use DSPM for AI to recommend Communication Compliance policies

ata Security Posture Management (DSPM) for AI includes a recommendation to create a Communication Compliance policy for Copilot interactions. This helps organizations proactively review prompt and response content for potential risk.

To create the policy from a recommendation:

1. In the Microsoft Purview portal, go to **Solutions** > **DSPM for AI**.
1. Select **Recommendations**.
1. Select the **Secure interactions in Microsoft Copilot experiences** recommendation.
1. Select **Create policy** and review the preselected conditions and reviewers.
1. Create the policy or modify it as needed.

Once created, the policy appears in the **Communication Compliance** solution and can be updated like any other policy.

## Review policy matches

Communication Compliance policies for Copilot interactions behave like other message policies:

- Each match appears in the **Pending** tab with metadata including the Copilot icon, sender and recipient, and matched content.
- You can take actions such as tagging, resolving, escalating, or exporting the message.
- Matches from prompts and responses appear separately.

Matches are also included in Communication Compliance reports and audit logs.

## Summary

By configuring Communication Compliance policies for Microsoft 365 Copilot, your organization can analyze prompt and response content for sensitive or risky interactions. This helps ensure that Copilot is used appropriately and that sensitive data remains protected, without restricting access for authorized users.
