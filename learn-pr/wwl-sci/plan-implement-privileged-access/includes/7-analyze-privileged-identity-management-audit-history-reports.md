With PIM, you can view activity, activations, and audit history for Azure privileged access group members and owners within your Azure AD organization.

If your organization has outsourced management functions to a service provider who uses [Azure delegated resource management](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/lighthouse/concepts/azure-delegated-resource-management), role assignments authorized by that service provider won't be shown here.

Follow these steps to view the audit history for privileged access groups.

## View resource audit history

**Resource audit** gives you a view of all activity associated with your privileged access groups.

1. Open **Azure AD Privileged Identity Management**.

2. Select **Privileged access groups (Preview)**.

3. Select the privileged access group you want to view audit history for.

4. Under **Activity**, select **Resource audit**.

5. Filter the history using a predefined date or custom range.
