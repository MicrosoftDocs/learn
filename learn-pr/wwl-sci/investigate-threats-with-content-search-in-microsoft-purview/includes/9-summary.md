One of the key features in the Microsoft Purview compliance portal is Content search. It's designed for times when the full-fledged search case management of eDiscovery isn't required. Content search is ideal for quick searches across content in Microsoft 365. A common example is searching for specific credit card numbers in SharePoint as part of a Data Loss Prevention (DLP) project. Content search is also useful when you must complete large searches across all your organization's mailboxes and SharePoint sites that exceed the limitations of using eDiscovery search.

This module examined how the Content search tool in the Microsoft Purview compliance portal can quickly find email in Exchange mailboxes, documents in SharePoint sites and OneDrive locations, and instant messaging conversations in Skype for Business. You learned how organizations can use the Content search tool to search for email, documents, and instant messaging conversations in collaboration tools such as Microsoft Teams and Microsoft 365 Groups.

This module also reviewed the Compliance search cmdlets that enable you to use Windows PowerShell scripts to complete large searches. While Content search uses a graphical interface, some administrators prefer to use the tool's PowerShell functionality. There are also PowerShell scripts can also integrate Content search results into your eDiscovery workflow.

This module examined the most common Content search scenarios, including:

 -  Searching all your Microsoft 365 data without limits on the number of mailboxes or documents.
 -  Configuring search permissions filtering to allow an eDiscovery manager to search a subset of mailboxes and sites in their Microsoft 365 organization.
 -  Exporting search results and statistics reports.
 -  Searching for and deleting email messages.
