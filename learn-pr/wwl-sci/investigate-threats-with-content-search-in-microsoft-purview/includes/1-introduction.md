One of the key features in the Microsoft Purview compliance portal is Content search. It's designed for times when the full-fledged search case management of eDiscovery isn't required. Content search is ideal for quick searches across content in Microsoft 365. A common example is searching for specific credit card numbers in SharePoint as part of a Data Loss Prevention (DLP) project. Content search is also useful when you must complete large searches across all your organization's mailboxes and SharePoint sites that exceed the limitations of using eDiscovery search.

This module examines how the Content search tool in the Microsoft Purview compliance portal can quickly find email in Exchange mailboxes, documents in SharePoint sites and OneDrive locations, and instant messaging conversations in Skype for Business. Organizations can use the Content search tool to search for email, documents, and instant messaging conversations in collaboration tools such as Microsoft Teams and Microsoft 365 Groups.

While Content search uses a graphical interface, there are also Compliance search cmdlets that enable you to use PowerShell scripts to complete large searches. PowerShell scripts can also integrate Content search results into your eDiscovery workflow.

Of special interest For the Security Operations Analyst, the Content search user interface also has a built-in KQL editor.

This module examines the most common Content search scenarios, including:

 -  Searching all your Microsoft 365 data without limits on the number of mailboxes or documents.
 -  Configuring search permissions filtering to allow an eDiscovery manager to search a subset of mailboxes and sites in their Microsoft 365 organization.
 -  Exporting search results and statistics reports.
 -  Searching for and deleting email messages.

After completing this module, you'll be able to:

 -  Describe how to use content search in the Microsoft Purview compliance portal.
 -  Design and create a content search.
 -  Preview the search results.
 -  View the search statistics.
 -  Export the search results and search report.
