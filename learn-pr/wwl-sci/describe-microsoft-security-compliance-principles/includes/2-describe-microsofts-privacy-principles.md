Microsoft’s products and services run on trust. Microsoft focuses on six key privacy principles when making decisions about data. Privacy is about making meaningful choices about how and why data is collected and used. It's about ensuring that you have the information you need to make the choices that are right for you across all Microsoft products and services.

The six privacy principles are:

- **Control**: Putting you, the customer, in control of your privacy with easy-to-use tools and clear choices.
- **Transparency**: Being transparent about data collection and use so that everyone can make informed decisions.
- **Security**: Protecting the data that is entrusted to Microsoft by using strong security and encryption.
- **Strong legal protections**: Respecting local privacy laws and fighting for legal protection of privacy as a fundamental human right.
- **No content-based targeting**: Not using email, chat, files, or other personal content to target advertising.
- **Benefits to you**: When Microsoft does collect data, it is used to benefit you, the customer, and to make your experiences better.

These principles form Microsoft’s privacy foundation, and they shape the way that products and services are designed. Find out more at the **Microsoft Trust Center** in the Learn More section below.
