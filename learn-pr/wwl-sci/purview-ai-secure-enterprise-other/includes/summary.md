Securing AI interactions goes beyond Microsoft 365. When users work with public or non-Microsoft AI apps, sensitive data can be exposed without appropriate controls. In this module, you used Microsoft Purview to identify which AI tools are in use and evaluate how they're being used. You then applied protections across multiple layers of risk.

You learned how to:

- Use DSPM for AI to discover tools, detect risky prompts, and get policy recommendations
- Evaluate compliance readiness with AI regulation templates in Compliance Manager
- Detect inappropriate or policy-violating AI content with Communication Compliance
- Analyze risky behavior using Insider Risk Management and assign adaptive risk levels
- Apply dynamic data loss prevention policies that adjust enforcement based on user risk
- Retain AI prompts and responses captured from enterprise and public tools

Without these capabilities, organizations risk uncertainties in how AI is used and where sensitive data is exposed. With Microsoft Purview, you applied integrated controls that support visibility, protection, and compliance, even when users work with tools outside the Microsoft 365 ecosystem.
