- Enhance policy strategy to determine what can be a saved query versus what requires an alert
- Ensure labeling strategy is in line with current Security and Compliance configuration

### Discovery

- Upgrade log collector
- Remove old data sources
- Add/Disable App Connectors

### Settings

- Review managed domains
- Verify current IP ranges for Corporate and VPN

## Application lifecycle management in Azure Container Apps

The Azure Container Apps application lifecycle revolves around [revisions](/azure/container-apps/revisions).

When you deploy a container app, the first revision is automatically created. [More revisions are created](/azure/container-apps/revisions) as [containers](/azure/container-apps/containers) change, or any adjustments are made to the `template` section of the configuration.

A container app flows through four phases: deployment, update, deactivation, and shut down.

### Deployment

As a container app is deployed, the first revision is automatically created.

### Update

As a container app is updated with a [revision scope-change](/azure/container-apps/revisions#revision-scope-changes), a new revision is created. You can [choose](/azure/container-apps/revisions#revision-modes) whether to automatically deactivate old revisions (single revision mode), or allow them to remain available (multiple revision mode).

### Zero downtime deployment

In single revision mode, Container Apps automatically ensures your app doesn't experience downtime when creating a new revision. The existing active revision isn't deactivated until the new revision is ready. If ingress is enabled, the existing revision continues to receive 100% of the traffic until the new revision is ready.

In multiple revision mode, you control when revisions are activated or deactivated and which revisions receive ingress traffic. If a [traffic splitting rule](/azure/container-apps/revisions-manage#traffic-splitting) is configured with `latestRevision` set to `true`, traffic doesn't switch to the latest revision until it's ready.

### Deactivate

Once a revision is no longer needed, you can deactivate a revision with the option to reactivate later. During deactivation, containers in the revision are [shut down](/azure/container-apps/application-lifecycle-management#shutdown).

-->

### Shutdown

The containers are shut down in the following situations:

-   As a container app scales in
-   As a container app is being deleted
-   As a revision is being deactivated

When a shutdown is initiated, the container host sends a [SIGTERM message](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_(IPC)) to your container. The code implemented in the container can respond to this operating system-level message to handle termination.

If your application doesn't respond within 30 seconds to the `SIGTERM` message, then [SIGKILL](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_(IPC)) terminates your container.
