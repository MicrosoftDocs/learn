quiz:
  questions:
  - content: "What is DevSecOps?"
    choices:
      - content: "A practice that ensures system uptime by maintaining optimal replica volumes."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "DevSecOps isn't concerned with replica volumes of systems, which refers to replication strategies used in high availability deployment scenarios."
      - content: "A security model used by developers to certify that code changes do not affect production environments."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "There's no certification process involved in DevSecOps. The idea behind DevSecOps is that security mechanisms are integrated throughout the development cycle to increase the overall security posture."
      - content: "A set of principles designed to integrate security testing and evaluation into the software development lifecycle (SDLC)."
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "DevSecOps is short for Development, Security, and Operations, which aims to integrate security activities into all stages of the SDLC to achieve application and infrastructure resilience."
      - content: "A method to monitor customer satisfaction after every release of the product to ensure continuous improvement."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "While monitoring customer satisfaction is essential, it's not directly related to DevSecOps. Monitoring is also more of an Operations concern than something taken care of within the Development phase."
  - content: "What is a service principal in Microsoft Entra ID?"
    choices:
    - content: "A managed identity for a specific Azure resource"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Service principals act as an interface to allow access using OAuth 2.0 protocols between Azure AD and independent software applications."
    - content: "An authentication mechanism that authenticates the client application identity"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This describes the process of OAuth2.0 that allows resources to accept external access, not just a service principal."
    - content: "A user identity for a specific Azure resource"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "User identities are tied to individual users, Service Client Identities authenticate applications."
    - content: "Azure platform tokens revocation mechanism"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Azure platform tokens are time-bound authorization keys issued by Microsoft Entra ID to resources. They've little to do with Service Principal authentication."
  - content: "What happens when a particular service account or machine accesses a resource using its Shared Access Signature token?"
    choices:
    - content: "The access shows up under the computer's credentials in Microsoft Entra ID's analytics logs."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Shared Access Signatures don't pertain to Microsoft Entra ID, they're Azure object storage mechanism."
    - content: "The resource will only be accessible if the token has the appropriate permission scope."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Shared Access Signatures work at the level of the specific bound resource, meaning the permissions granted to the corresponding SAS token apply to this target only."
    - content: "It bypasses all permissions set on the resource."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Authentication and Authorization are always calculated and checked against the set access control policies and user/role-based authorization mechanisms."
    - content: "It triggers event-based alert notifications"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Shared Access Signatures are a method still not greatly prevalent in Azure Functionality, and thus don't trigger alerts."
  - content: "What type of threats is the Azure web application firewall designed to protect against?"
    choices:
    - content: "Server level attacks such as shared hosting violations"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Azure Web Application Firewall is deployed in front of a web server farm and protects against layer 7 -application-level- distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks."
    - content: "Phishing attacks and credential stealing attempts"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "As useful as this would be, the WAF is positioned for application-level security only."
    - content: "SQL injection, Cross-site scripting attacks, and HTTP protocol violations"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "These are some of the most common web applications' vulnerability exploits, all of which can be programmed into a well-managed web application firewall policy."
    - content: "Malware propagation and attack repulsion"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "WAF is position around application-level DDoS attack protection, this does NOT include general-purpose malware repulsion"
