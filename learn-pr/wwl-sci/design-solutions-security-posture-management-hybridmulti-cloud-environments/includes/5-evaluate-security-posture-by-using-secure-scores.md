## Overview of secure score in Microsoft Defender for Cloud

Microsoft Defender for Cloud has two main goals:

-   to help you understand your current security situation
-   to help you efficiently and effectively improve your security

The central feature in Defender for Cloud that enables you to achieve those goals is the **secure score**.

Defender for Cloud continually assesses your cross-cloud resources for security issues. It then aggregates all the findings into a single score so that you can tell, at a glance, your current security situation: the higher the score, the lower the identified risk level.
