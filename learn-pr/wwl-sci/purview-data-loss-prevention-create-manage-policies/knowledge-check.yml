    title: Check your knowledge
    questions:
    - content: "A security team is planning a new data loss prevention (DLP) policy to address accidental external sharing. Some team members want to immediately block sharing, while others want visibility first. What should guide the initial policy decision?"
      choices:
      - content: "The availability of blocking actions for the selected locations."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect: Available actions matter later, but they shouldn't drive the initial intent of the policy."
      - content: "Clarity about the specific risk scenario the policy is meant to address."
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "Correct: Clear policy intent ensures detection, scope, and actions align with the risk being reduced."
      - content: "How quickly the policy can be deployed across all locations."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect: Speed of deployment shouldn't override understanding the role the policy plays in reducing risk."

    - content: "An organization needs a DLP policy to address a well-known compliance scenario quickly. The policy might need refinement later as workflows are better understood. How should the team start?"
      choices:
      - content: "Create a fully custom policy to avoid rework later."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect: Custom policies offer flexibility, but templates can be appropriate for known, common scenarios."
      - content: "Delay policy creation until all workflows are fully documented."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect: Waiting for perfect information delays protection unnecessarily."
      - content: "Start with a template-based policy and plan to refine it if needed."
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "Correct: Templates are useful for common scenarios and can provide a starting point that evolves over time."

    - content: "A DLP policy is triggering frequently but many alerts represent acceptable business activity. What detection adjustment is most likely to reduce noise?"
      choices:
      - content: "Add contextual conditions such as action type or destination."
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "Correct: Adding context helps focus detection on scenarios that actually represent risk."
      - content: "Remove content-based detection entirely."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect: Content signals are often necessary and shouldn't be removed without understanding their role."
      - content: "Increase enforcement actions to discourage users."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect: Stronger enforcement doesn't address inaccurate detection and can increase disruption."

    - content: "A policy applies to all users and locations and is difficult to validate because results are noisy and inconsistent. What scoping approach would improve validation?"
      choices:
      - content: "Apply the policy only after enforcement is enabled."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect: Enforcement increases disruption but doesn't improve understanding of policy behavior."
      - content: "Start with a narrower scope focused on higher-risk locations or user groups."
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "Correct: Narrower scope makes behavior easier to interpret and refine before expanding coverage."
      - content: "Keep the broad scope but lower alert thresholds."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect: Threshold changes don't address underlying scoping issues."

    - content: "After running a DLP policy in simulation mode, results show frequent triggers during normal workflows. What is the most appropriate next step?"
      choices:
      - content: "Enable enforcement immediately to reduce risk exposure."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect: Enforcing before refinement risks disrupting legitimate work."
      - content: "Delete the policy and restart with a new design."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect: Simulation results are meant to inform refinement, not restart efforts."
      - content: "Adjust detection, scope, or actions based on observed behavior, then revalidate."
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "Correct: Simulation is a feedback loop used to tune policy behavior before enforcement."
