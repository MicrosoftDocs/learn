Creating a data loss prevention policy isn't just a setup task. Each choice made during policy creation determines how data is evaluated, when users are interrupted, and how risk is surfaced to security teams. Small decisions around detection, scope, and actions can lead to very different outcomes, even when the same data is involved.

Many data loss prevention (DLP) issues stem from policies that were created too quickly or without clear intent. Overly broad detection, unnecessary enforcement, or skipping validation can create noise, disrupt normal work, and reduce trust in the policy itself. Those issues often become more visible over time as policies interact, priorities change, and business workflows evolve.

Creating and managing DLP policies in Microsoft Purview requires making deliberate choices about detection, scope, actions, and validation, then revisiting those choices as conditions change. Understanding how those decisions affect policy behavior helps reduce over-enforcement, improve outcomes, and support long-term policy effectiveness.

## Learning objectives

By the end of this module, you'll be able to:

- Define clear intent for a DLP policy before creating it
- Choose between templates and custom policies based on the scenario
- Configure detection logic that balances coverage and accuracy
- Scope policies to the right locations and users
- Select actions that guide or restrict behavior appropriately
- Validate policy behavior using simulation mode before enforcement
- Understand how adaptive protection extends DLP for dynamic risk scenarios
- Create a DLP policy end to end using a guided portal walkthrough
