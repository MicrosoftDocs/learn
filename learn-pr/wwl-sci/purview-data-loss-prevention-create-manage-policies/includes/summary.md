Creating effective DLP policies starts with understanding why the policy exists and how each design decision affects behavior. DLP isn't just about blocking activity. It's about evaluating data in context, guiding users appropriately, and reducing risk without disrupting normal work.

In this module, you learned how to:

- Define clear intent for a DLP policy before creating it
- Choose between templates and custom policies based on the scenario
- Configure detection logic that balances coverage and accuracy
- Scope policies to the right locations and users
- Select actions that guide or restrict behavior appropriately
- Validate policy behavior using simulation mode before enforcement
- Understand how adaptive protection extends DLP for dynamic risk scenarios
- Create a DLP policy end to end using a guided portal walkthrough

Without this approach, policies are often created too broadly, enforced too quickly, or validated too late. That can lead to unnecessary noise, user frustration, and reduced trust in DLP controls.

Applying these practices helps ensure DLP policies are intentional, predictable, and aligned with real-world behavior, making it easier to move from design to enforcement with confidence.
