Protecting sensitive data in modern organizations is more complex than ever. With the rise of cloud services, AI-driven tools, and remote collaboration, security teams must safeguard data against unauthorized access, accidental exposure, and emerging risks. Without a structured approach to data protection, organizations face compliance violations, financial losses, and reputational damage.

This module explored how Microsoft Purview provides a comprehensive approach to data security. It enables organizations to classify, label, and protect data, enforce data loss prevention policies, and detect potential risks before they lead to security incidents.
