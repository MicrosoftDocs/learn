Contoso needs to protect sensitive data as it moves across cloud services, endpoints, AI-powered tools, and collaborative platforms. Without clear protections, sensitive data can be accidentally exposed or intentionally misused, leading to financial loss, regulatory penalties, and operational disruption.

In this module, you learned about:

- Classifying and labeling sensitive data with Microsoft Purview.
- Applying encryption, access controls, and content markings with sensitivity labels.
- Using data loss prevention (DLP) policies to control data sharing and prevent leaks.
- Detecting insider risks based on user activity and behavior.
- Investigating incidents using Audit, Activity explorer, and Content explorer.
- Extending data protection to AI-generated and AI-processed data.

With these protections in place, Contoso can secure sensitive information, maintain compliance, and reduce the risk of data exposure as business operations evolve.
