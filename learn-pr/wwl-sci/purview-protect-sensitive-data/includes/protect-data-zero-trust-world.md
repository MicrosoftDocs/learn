Traditional security models assume that users and devices inside an organization's network are trusted. However, modern threats require a different approach. Zero Trust operates under the principle that every access request could be a potential risk, requiring continuous verification and least-privilege access to minimize security threats.

## Principles of Zero Trust for data security

Zero Trust is built on three core principles that help organizations reduce security risks and maintain control over sensitive data:

- **Verify explicitly**: Every user, device, and access request must be authenticated and authorized before gaining access to data. This includes enforcing strong identity and access management (IAM) controls, such as **multifactor authentication (MFA)** and **conditional access** policies in **Microsoft Entra ID**.

- **Apply least privilege**: Users should only have the minimum level of access required to perform their tasks. **Microsoft Purview Privileged Access Management** helps enforce granular access controls, ensuring that data is only accessible to those who need it.

- **Assume breach**: Organizations must continuously monitor for threats and respond proactively. **Microsoft Defender for Cloud** and **Microsoft Sentinel** provide real-time monitoring, helping detect suspicious activity and mitigate risks before they escalate.

## How Zero Trust enhances data security

By following Zero Trust principles, organizations can strengthen their security posture and reduce data exposure risks. This approach ensures that:

- Only verified users and devices can access sensitive data.
- Access is granted based on risk, not assumed trust.
- Security teams can detect and respond to threats in real time.

These principles guide how organizations should **classify**, **label**, and **control access to data**, integrating Microsoft Purview's data protection tools to safeguard information across cloud and hybrid environments.
