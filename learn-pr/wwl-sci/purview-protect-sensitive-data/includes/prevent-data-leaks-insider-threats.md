Sensitive data is exposed in many ways, whether through mistakes or intentional actions. Contoso needs policies that reduce the risk of sensitive information being shared, accessed, or used improperly. Data loss prevention and insider risk management help control data movement and detect activities that could lead to data exposure.

## Data loss prevention policies

Data loss prevention (DLP) policies help prevent accidental or unauthorized sharing of sensitive information. DLP works by inspecting content and applying policy actions based on conditions such as data type, destination, and user activity.

- **Detect sensitive information**: DLP policies use classification, sensitivity labels, and built-in sensitive information types to identify content that requires protection.
- **Apply policy rules**: DLP evaluates conditions like content type, sharing location, and recipient to determine whether to allow, block, or warn users about an action.
- **Protect data across services**: DLP policies apply to email, Teams chats and meetings, SharePoint, OneDrive, endpoints, and AI-powered services such as Microsoft 365 Copilot.

DLP policies reduce accidental exposure and help enforce compliance without blocking productivity.

## Insider risk management

Insider risk management helps identify activities that could lead to intentional or accidental data exposure. These risks include data theft, unauthorized sharing, or risky behaviors involving sensitive information.

Insider risk management policies allow organizations to:

- Define risk indicators based on user activities, such as mass downloads, unusual sharing, or transferring data to unmanaged devices.
- Detect patterns that might suggest data misuse without monitoring individual users directly.
- Prioritize alerts based on risk levels to help security teams investigate potential issues.

By using insider risk management, Contoso can reduce the chance of data leaks while respecting user privacy and maintaining compliance.
