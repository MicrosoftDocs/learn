Organizations need tools to prevent sensitive data from being exposed, whether through accidental sharing, poor security practices, or intentional misuse. Without strong protections, organizations face compliance risks, financial losses, and reputational damage.

## Common risks

Sensitive data can be leaked or exposed in various ways. Organizations must identify these risks to implement effective security measures.

- **Unauthorized sharing**: Employees might unintentionally send sensitive documents outside the organization, leading to potential data exposure.
- **Data stored in unprotected locations**: Files saved to personal devices, unmanaged cloud apps, or external storage increase security risks.
- **Malicious insiders**: Employees with access to sensitive data might misuse their privileges for financial gain, competitive advantage, or other malicious purposes.

## Mitigation strategies

Organizations need tools to prevent data from being exposed, both accidentally and intentionally. Whether caused by human error, compromised accounts, or malicious actions, data leaks pose significant security and compliance risks. A structured approach to risk detection and policy enforcement helps reduce these risks while maintaining business productivity.

### Apply Insider Risk Management tools

Not all data threats come from external attackers. Insider risks, whether accidental or intentional, pose a serious security challenge. Organizations need tools to monitor activity, detect risks, and respond before data is compromised.

Microsoft Purview Insider Risk Management helps organizations:

- Detect unusual file access, data transfers, and security violations.
- Identify risky behavior while maintaining user privacy.
- Automate risk alerts and investigations to reduce response times.

By detecting potentially risky behavior early, organizations can take action before it results in data exposure.

### Implement DLP policies

Data loss prevention (DLP) policies help prevent sensitive data from being shared inappropriately. Organizations can define policies that automatically block or restrict sharing based on data sensitivity.

With Microsoft Purview DLP, organizations can:

- Prevent data leaks across email, cloud services, and endpoints.
- Enforce restrictions on copying, pasting, or transferring sensitive files.
- Apply policies dynamically to protect regulated data and intellectual property.

DLP ensures that sensitive data isn't accidentally or deliberately exposed, while still allowing secure collaboration.

### Use Adaptive Protection

Static security policies might not be enough to address evolving threats. Adaptive protection adjusts security controls based on real-time risk insights from insider risk management, ensuring that sensitive data is only accessible under safe conditions.

Microsoft Purview uses Adaptive Protection to:

- Assess user activity and apply security policies dynamically.
- Restrict data access for users exhibiting risky behavior based on Insider Risk Management signals.
- Reduce unnecessary security friction for trusted users.

By integrating insider risk insights with DLP enforcement, adaptive protection ensures that security adapts to user behavior, strengthening protection for high-risk users while minimizing disruptions for low-risk users.

By proactively identifying risks and applying the right mitigation strategies, organizations can protect sensitive data while enabling secure collaboration.
