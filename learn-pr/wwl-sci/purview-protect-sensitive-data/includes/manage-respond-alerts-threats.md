Security teams need visibility and control to respond to threats effectively. Without proper monitoring and investigative tools, organizations risk missing critical security incidents that could lead to data breaches, compliance violations, or operational disruptions. A proactive security approach ensures that risks are addressed before they become serious threats.

## Security monitoring and response tools

Organizations can strengthen their security posture by using **Microsoft Purview** and **Microsoft Defender** tools to detect, investigate, and respond to security risks.

### Microsoft Purview Audit

Organizations must be able to track and investigate user activities across their environment to identify security incidents. **Microsoft Purview Audit** provides detailed visibility into user actions, helping security teams detect unusual behavior, unauthorized access, and policy violations.

With Microsoft Purview Audit, security teams can:

- Review user activity logs to investigate security incidents.
- Identify unauthorized access attempts and detect unusual behavior.
- Use Audit (Premium) capabilities to retain logs for long-term forensic analysis.

### Alerts in Microsoft Purview

Microsoft Purview provides alerting capabilities across multiple security and compliance solutions, helping organizations detect and respond to data loss, insider threats, and policy violations. Alerts are managed within specific Purview solutions, such as Insider Risk Management and Data Loss Prevention (DLP), allowing security teams to address risks in their relevant contexts.

With Alerts in Microsoft Purview, security teams can:

- Monitor security and compliance alerts directly within Insider Risk Management, DLP, and other Microsoft Purview solutions.
- Take immediate action on alerts within Microsoft Purview tools to prevent security incidents.
- Prioritize alerts based on severity and risk to focus on the most critical incidents.

By integrating alerting capabilities within specific security and compliance tools, Microsoft Purview ensures that security teams can effectively track and mitigate risks where they occur.

### Activity and content explorer

Security teams need to understand how data is accessed, shared, and classified within an organization. **activity explorer** and **content explorer** provides real-time insights into user activities and content classification, helping security teams monitor security events.

With **activity explorer** and **content explorer**, organizations can gain insights into data access and classification:

- **Activity explorer**: Provides insights into user activity, tracking data access, movement, and security events.
- **Content explorer**: Helps security teams view and classify sensitive data across Microsoft 365 applications, identifying potential risks.
- Identify anomalies in file sharing, downloads, and access attempts to detect potential security risks.

### Microsoft Defender XDR

**Microsoft Defender XDR (Extended Detection and Response)** provides a unified threat detection and response capability by correlating security signals from multiple sources.

With Microsoft Defender XDR, security teams can:

- Correlate security signals across Microsoft Purview tools, endpoints, and cloud services to provide a comprehensive view of threats.
- Identify suspicious activity by analyzing security events across multiple sources.
- Automate responses to detected threats and reduce investigation time.

## A proactive approach to security

By integrating security monitoring, alerting, and response tools, organizations can proactively detect and mitigate threats before they escalate.

This approach ensures that security teams can:

- Analyze data access and usage patterns to identify potential security risks.
- Investigate security incidents before they lead to breaches.
- Respond to alerts in real-time to mitigate threats.

A well-defined security monitoring strategy ensures that organizations stay ahead of potential risks while protecting sensitive data and maintaining compliance.
