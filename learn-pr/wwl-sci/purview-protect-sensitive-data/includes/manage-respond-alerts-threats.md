Security teams need tools to detect suspicious activity and respond before small issues become major incidents. Contoso uses security alerts and investigation tools across Microsoft Purview and Microsoft Defender to monitor policy violations, investigate potential data leaks, and take corrective actions.

## Security alerts in Microsoft Purview

Microsoft Purview generates alerts when policies detect activity that might put sensitive data at risk. These alerts help identify issues like:

- Policy violations from data loss prevention (DLP) policies.
- Insider risk management policy triggers based on user activities.

Security teams can review alert details, examine user activity, and take follow-up actions as needed.

## Investigations and response actions

After reviewing an alert, security teams can:

- Review user activity timelines and access details.
- Determine whether the activity was authorized, accidental, or intentional.
- Use **Microsoft Purview Audit** to review detailed user activity logs that support incident analysis.
- Use **Activity explorer** to review data access, movement, and sharing activities.
- Use **Content explorer** and **Data explorer** to validate how sensitive data is classified and labeled across Microsoft 365 services.

These investigation tools help security teams analyze incidents, verify policy effectiveness, and support ongoing risk management.
