Modern organizations handle enormous volumes of sensitive data across cloud platforms, collaboration tools, and AI-driven applications. While these technologies enable faster decisions and greater productivity, they also create new security risks. Sensitive data can be accidentally exposed, improperly accessed, or used in ways that violate compliance requirements.

To address these challenges, security teams need to go beyond traditional perimeter defenses. They must understand where sensitive data resides, how it's classified, and how to apply consistent protection across every environment where that data is used.

In this module, you'll learn how Microsoft Purview helps organizations:

- Discover and classify sensitive data across multiple platforms.
- Apply sensitivity labels and encryption to control access.
- Enforce data loss prevention policies to prevent leaks.
- Detect insider risks and emerging threats proactively.
- Secure data processed and generated by AI tools.

This module provides the foundation for applying data security protections that support compliance while enabling users to collaborate securely across cloud, endpoint, and AI environments.
