AI, cloud services, and collaboration platforms have transformed how organizations generate, share, and analyze data. While these technologies drive efficiency and innovation, they also introduce new security challenges. Sensitive information can be exposed through unauthorized access, accidental sharing, or AI-driven tools processing data in unintended ways.

As organizations increase their use of AI-driven tools and cloud-based collaboration, security teams must address new risks, such as unintentional data exposure and policy violations. Without a proactive data security strategy, organizations risk financial losses, compliance violations, and operational disruptions.

Microsoft Purview provides a comprehensive approach to safeguarding data across cloud, endpoint, and AI environments. It enables organizations to classify, label, and protect sensitive information, enforce data loss prevention policies, and detect potential risks before they lead to security incidents.
