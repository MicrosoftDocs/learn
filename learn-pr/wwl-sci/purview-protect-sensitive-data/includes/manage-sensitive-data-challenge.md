Modern organizations operate in complex digital environments where sensitive data is generated, stored, and shared across multiple platforms. Managing this data effectively requires overcoming several security and compliance challenges.

## The expanding data landscape

Sensitive data is no longer confined to on-premises servers. It exists across cloud platforms, endpoints, AI-driven tools, and collaboration applications. While these technologies improve efficiency, they also introduce security risks.

- **Data is everywhere**: Emails, cloud storage, AI tools, and remote work solutions create a distributed data environment, making it harder to control access and prevent leaks.
- **Users collaborate across multiple platforms**: Files are shared both inside and outside the organization, increasing the risk of accidental or unauthorized exposure.

By 2025, global data volumes are expected to reach 175 zettabytes, a tenfold increase from 2016. As structured and unstructured data continues to grow, organizations must implement robust data discovery and classification strategies to maintain security and compliance.

## Balancing security with usability

Security policies should protect sensitive data without disrupting business operations. Overly restrictive controls can lead to shadow IT, where employees bypass security measures to complete their work, creating security gaps.

- **Security vs. usability**: Strong security controls must align with business workflows to be effective. Employees need secure collaboration tools that don't disrupt productivity while still enforcing data protection measures.

## The challenge of data visibility

Many organizations struggle to track where sensitive data resides, how it's accessed, and who has permissions. This lack of visibility increases security and compliance risks.

- **Lack of visibility**: Research shows that organizations face significant challenges in tracking and securing their data:

  - 88% of organizations lack confidence in their ability to detect or prevent sensitive data loss.
  - More than 80% of corporate data remains "dark", meaning unclassified and unprotected.

Without visibility, organizations struggle to enforce security policies, leaving them vulnerable to breaches and compliance failures.

## Why organizations must address these challenges

Failing to manage sensitive data effectively can lead to:

- Financial and reputational damage from data breaches.
- Regulatory penalties for failing to meet compliance standards.
- Operational disruptions due to security incidents and data loss.

To mitigate these risks, organizations need a structured approach to identifying, securing, and governing sensitive data.
