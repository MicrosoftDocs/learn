  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "Your organization needs to apply encryption and access controls to sensitive files across Microsoft 365. Which Microsoft Purview feature should you use?"
    choices:
    - content: "Data loss prevention (DLP) policies"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. DLP policies control sharing but don't apply encryption or access controls."
    - content: "Sensitivity labels"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Sensitivity labels apply encryption, access controls, and content markings based on classification."
    - content: "Insider risk management"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Insider risk management detects risky user behavior but doesn't apply protection to content."

  - content: "A user attempts to share a file containing confidential customer information to an external contact. Which Microsoft Purview capability can help prevent this data from being shared?"
    choices:
    - content: "Data loss prevention (DLP) policies"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. DLP policies evaluate content and apply actions to prevent unauthorized data sharing."
    - content: "Retention policies"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Retention policies control how long data is kept but don't block sharing."
    - content: "Sensitivity labels"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Sensitivity labels apply classification and protection but don't block sharing directly."

  - content: "Security teams need to detect risky user activities such as mass downloads, unusual sharing, or data transfers to unmanaged devices. Which Microsoft Purview capability provides activity-based risk detection?"
    choices:
    - content: "Audit"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Audit records activity but doesn't evaluate risk or generate alerts."
    - content: "Insider risk management"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Insider risk management detects risky behavior using user activity signals."
    - content: "Sensitivity labels"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Sensitivity labels classify and protect content but don't monitor user behavior."


  - content: "Security teams want to investigate recent data movement and access activity across Microsoft 365 services. Which combination of Microsoft Purview tools provides these insights?"
    choices:
    - content: "Activity explorer, Content explorer, and Audit"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. These tools allow security teams to review user activity, data movement, and classified content."
    - content: "Azure Policy, Compliance Score, and Power Automate"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. These tools aren't used for investigation of user activity or data classification."
    - content: "Microsoft Sentinel, Azure Monitor, and Defender XDR"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. These tools provide broader security monitoring but are outside of Purview's investigation tools."

  - content: "Your organization uses AI-powered services in Microsoft 365. How can Microsoft Purview help prevent sensitive data from being exposed through AI prompts and responses?"
    choices:
    - content: "By blocking all AI processing by default"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Purview applies protection policies but doesn't block AI services by default."
    - content: "By encrypting all AI-generated content automatically"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Encryption depends on sensitivity labels, not universal AI encryption."
    - content: "By applying DLP, sensitivity labels, and insider risk management policies"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. These Purview controls extend to AI interactions to protect sensitive data inputs and outputs."
