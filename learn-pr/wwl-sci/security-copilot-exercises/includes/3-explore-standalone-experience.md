The security administrator for your organization provisioned Copilot. Since you're the senior analyst on the team, the administrator added you as a Copilot owner and asked you to familiarize yourself with the solution.

In this exercise, you explore all the key landmarks in the landing page of the standalone experience of Security Copilot. The tasks are organized by landmark and start with the landmark at the top left corner of the screen (the home menu) and then progress from left to right and top to bottom, but you can choose to go do the tasks in any order, just make sure you access the simulated environment in first step of the first task.

**As you explore, keep in mind that unless otherwise stated, the information displayed and the configuration settings are for the currently selected workspace**. For this exercise, all your exploration is done in the SecurityCopilot_Workspace, which is shown at the top of the page, next to where it says Microsoft Security Copilot.
