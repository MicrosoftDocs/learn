In this module, you went through a series of simulation-based exercises to help you effectively use Microsoft Security Copilot in your own work environment.

You went through a first run experience using the Microsoft Security Copilot wizard, which involved provisioning security compute units (SCU). You explored the features of the standalone experience of Copilot, including owner settings, sessions, and promptbooks. You also created your own promptbook.

The module then moved on to exercises focused on managing sources. You configured a Microsoft plugin. You added a custom plugin and ran prompts using that plugin. You integrated a knowledge base into Copilot using file upload and ran prompts that reasoned over that knowledge base.

Lastly, you explored the capabilities of Copilot embedded in Defender XDR, Purview, Microsoft Entra, and Defender for Cloud.

Now that you completed this module, you can:

- Set Up and provision Microsoft Security Copilot.
- Explore the standalone experience of Microsoft Security Copilot.
- Manage sources.
- Work with prompts and promptbooks.
- Explore the features of the different embedded experiences.
