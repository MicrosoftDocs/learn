    1. Select **Try now**.
    1. You can close the Explore all solutions pop-up by selecting the **X**. Alternatively, you can select Next to go through the information. If you go through all six information windows, you'll need to scroll-up to get back to the top of the page, when you're done.

1. From the Microsoft Purview portal, select **Insider Risk Management**.

1. Select **Alerts**.

1. Select the first alert on the list, alert ID: **86e52569**.
    1. This alert is associated with the policy, 'Potential data theft - Employee Departure.' Under User details, you can gain more context on why the user was identified as a high impact user by selecting **View all details**. Review the user details then select the **X** to close the User details window.
    1. The current page shows **All risk factors**. If you scroll down, there are even more details to consume.
    1. Select the **Activity explorer** tab, to quickly review a timeline of potentially risky activity and filter for specific risk activities associated with the alert. Select, the first activity on the list, labeled **Files accessed on SPO**. Review the information provided then select **X** to close the window.

#### Task: Gain contextual summary of evidence collected in eDiscovery review sets (Preview)

In this task, you explore the capability of Copilot to Microsoft Purview to gain a contextual summary of evidence collected in an eDiscovery review set. 

Legal investigations can take hours, days, even weeks to sift through the list of evidence collected in review sets, requiring costly resources like outside counsel to manually go through each document to determine the relevancy to the case. Copilot can significantly reduce that burden by generating summaries of conversations in a variety of languages and the documents that may be included as attachments.

Microsoft Copilot assumes the permissions of the user when it tries to access the data to answer queries. To access data associated with the Microsoft Purview eDiscovery solution, users should have previously been assigned an appropriate role.

        1. Information about the conversation appears in the window to the right. **Scroll** to view the source history. There's quite a bit of text included in this teams conversation. It can be time-consuming to sift through the information.
        1. With Security Copilot, you can gain a comprehensive summary of the conversation in the review set â€“ in the single click of a button! Select **Summarize**. Copilot also provides prompt suggestions and the prompt bar for you to enter your own prompts in furtherance of the investigation. This helps you save time and conduct investigations more efficiently!

1. Refer back to the list of Teams conversations. This time, select the second item on the list select item **#2** .
    1. The subject is displayed in a non-English language. This is common challenge with multi-national corporation whose employees speak various languages. The window with the source conversations shows a conversation history with non-English language. Select **Summarize** to view a summary in English, which is my default language for Copilot.
    1. Within Microsoft Teams, you can send cloud attachments, which are links to documents. Expand item #2 by selecting the **>**. The first subitem is a Word document. Select the document then select **Summarize** to have Copilot generate a summary

#### Task: Create Keyword Query Language (KeyQL) queries using natural language to search in eDiscovery (Premium)

In this task, you explore the capability of Copilot in Microsoft Purview eDiscovery (Premium) to create Keyword Query Language (KeyQL) queries using natural language. Users provide a prompt in natural language and Copilot generates a query in KeyQL language, making your search iterations faster and more accurate. This feature also enables analysts, at all levels, to conduct advanced investigations using KeyQL.

Microsoft Copilot assumes the permissions of the user when it tries to access the data to answer queries. To access data associated with the Microsoft Purview eDiscovery solution, users should have previously been assigned an appropriate role.

1. From the New Microsoft Purview portal, select **View all solutions**, then select **eDiscovery**, listed under Risk & Compliance.

1. For this simulation, you're taken directly to the page for cases.
1. Select **Fabrikam vs Contoso**.
1. Select **Create a search**.
    1. Enter a search name.
    1. Enter a description.
    1. Select **Create**.
1. Add a data source
    1. Select **Add data sources**.
    1. In the search bar, enter **Sales**.
    1. From the search results, select **Sales**.
    1. From the bottom of the page, select **Save**.
1. Now use Copilot draft a query in natural language. Select **Draft a query with Copilot**.
    1. From the box labeled natural language prompt, select **View prompts**. This is a great starting point. You could look at suggested prompts to determine how to craft a natural language query for suggested prompts. For example, Find all emails containing the words budget and finance and have attachments.
    1. For this example, however, you know what you are looking for. Youâ€™ve been told that you need to find all conversations related to a recent acquisition. Use copy/paste to enter **Find all conversations that contain the keywords; acquisition, stock, Bitdefender, Frostvision, offshore**.
    1. When you enter your natural language prompt, you can have Copilot refine the query to ensure a more accurate query output. Select **Refine** then **Accept**.
    1. Select **Generate KeyQL**. Security Copilot refines the prompt and then in a simple click, can generate the query within seconds!  
    1. The purpose of this exercise is to show how easily Copilot can generate the code for a query using natural language. In your production environment, to run the generated query copy the KeyQL code into the run box and select run.
