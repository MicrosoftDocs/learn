## Manage automation uploads

Enable the **File Content Analysis** capability so that certain files and email attachments can automatically be uploaded to the cloud for more inspection in Automated investigation.  Identify the files and email attachments by specifying the file extension names and email attachment extension names.  For example, if you add exe and bat as file or attachment extension names, then all files or attachments with those extensions will automatically be sent to the cloud for more inspection during Automated investigation.

Enable the Memory Content Analysis capability if you would like Microsoft Defender for Endpoint to automatically investigate memory content of processes. When enabled, memory content might be uploaded to Microsoft Defender for Endpoint during an Automated investigation.
