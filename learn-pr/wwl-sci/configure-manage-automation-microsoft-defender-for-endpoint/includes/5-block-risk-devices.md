Contain a threat by not letting risky devices access your corporate resources through Conditional Access.

You need a Microsoft Intune environment, with Intune managed and Entra ID joined Windows 10 or higher devices.

The required roles to access these portals and implement Conditional access:

- Microsoft Defender portal - To configure roles in the Microsoft Defender portal, you need to sign in with the Security Administrator role. To manage portal advanced settings, you need the Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Administrator role.

- Intune - You need to sign in to the portal with Security Administrator rights with management permissions.

- Entra ID portal - You need to sign in as a Security Administrator, or Conditional Access administrator.

Take the following steps to enable Conditional Access:

1. Turn on the Microsoft Intune connection from Microsoft Defender XDR.

1. Turn on the Defender for Endpoint integration in Endpoint Manager

1. Create the compliance policy in Intune

1. Assign the policy

1. Create an Entra ID Conditional Access policy

### Turn on the Microsoft Intune connection

1. In the Microsoft Defender XDR navigation pane, select **Settings > Endpoints** and then under General section select **Advanced features**.

1. Toggle the Microsoft Intune connection setting to **On**.

1. Select **Save preferences**.

### Turn on the Defender for Endpoint integration in the Intune admin center

1. Sign in to the Microsoft Intune admin center [https://intune.microsoft.com](https://intune.microsoft.com).

1. Select **Endpoint security > Microsoft Defender for Endpoint**.

1. Set **Allow Microsoft Defender for Endpoint to enforce Endpoint Security Configurations** to **On**.

1. Select **Save**.

### Create the compliance policy in the Intune admin center

1. Select **Compliance**.

1. Select **+ Create policy**.

1. In Platform, select **Windows 10 and later**, and select **Create**.

1. On the *Compliance Settings* tab, expand **Microsoft Defender for Endpoint**, set **Require the device to be at or under the machine risk score** to your preferred level:

    - Clear: This level is the most secure. The device can't have any existing threats and still access company resources. If any threats are found, the device is evaluated as noncompliant.
    - Low: The device is compliant if only low-level threats exist. Devices with medium or high threat levels aren't compliant.
    - Medium: The device is compliant if the threats found on the device are low or medium. If high-level threats are detected, the device is determined as noncompliant.
    - High: This level is the least secure and allows all threat levels. So devices with high, medium, or low threat levels are considered compliant.

1. Select **Next** and in the **Actions for noncompliance** tab, select actions to take.

1. Select **Next** and in the **Scope tags** tab, leave the *Default* or select other scope tags.
