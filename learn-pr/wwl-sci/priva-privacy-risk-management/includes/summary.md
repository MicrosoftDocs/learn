Managing sensitive personal data presents significant challenges. Organizations must address privacy risks such as data overexposure, unauthorized access, and unnecessary data retention while ensuring compliance with privacy regulations. In this module, you took on the role of an administrator tasked with implementing proactive measures to identify, manage, and mitigate these risks.

Through Microsoft Priva Privacy Risk Management, you learned how to create and manage policies for data overexposure, data transfers, and data minimization. These tools enable organizations to monitor data handling practices, trigger alerts for potential risks, and enforce corrective actions that align with regulatory and operational requirements.

In this module, you learned to:

- Understand the purpose and key capabilities of Privacy Risk Management.
- Deploy policies from templates or design custom policies tailored to specific organizational needs.
- Monitor policy performance, investigate alerts, and take corrective actions to mitigate risks.
- Apply insights from Privacy Risk Management reports to improve data handling practices.

Without Microsoft Priva Privacy Risk Management, organizations would face manual, inconsistent processes for addressing privacy risks, leaving them more vulnerable to compliance gaps and data breaches. By using Privacy Risk Management, organizations can ensure secure data handling, maintain compliance, and build trust with stakeholders through a proactive approach to privacy.
