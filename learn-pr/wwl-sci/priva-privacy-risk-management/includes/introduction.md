Organizations face growing challenges in managing personal data responsibly and complying with privacy regulations. Mishandling personal data, whether through overexposure, insufficient safeguards, or inconsistent policies, can lead to regulatory penalties, reputational damage, and loss of customer trust.

Microsoft Priva Privacy Risk Management is designed to help organizations proactively address these challenges. It provides visibility into personal data handling practices, identifies potential risks such as overexposed or unprotected data, and offers automated solutions to mitigate them. By aligning privacy management efforts with organizational goals, Privacy Risk Management enables businesses to reduce risks, support compliance, and build trust with stakeholders.

## Scenario

Imagine you work for a healthcare organization that manages large volumes of personal data, including patient records and employee information. A recent audit revealed that sensitive data, such as Social Security numbers and medical histories, is overexposed within internal file shares. Some teams also lack processes for addressing potential risks, like access by unauthorized users. Your organization needs a solution to identify and mitigate these risks while supporting compliance with privacy regulations.

You need a tool that can analyze data handling practices, identify potential privacy risks, and enforce policies to protect sensitive information.
