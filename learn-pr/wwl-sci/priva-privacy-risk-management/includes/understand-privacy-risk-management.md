Microsoft Priva Privacy Risk Management provides tools to address critical privacy challenges, helping organizations identify, manage, and mitigate privacy risks effectively. By creating policies for data overexposure, data transfer, and data minimization, organizations can ensure personal data is handled securely, reduce regulatory risks, and maintain trust.

## Key use cases of Privacy Risk Management

Priva's policies address three major privacy concerns:

- **Data overexposure**: Detects when sensitive personal data is accessible to more users than necessary, both within and outside the organization. For example, internal sites with overly permissive access settings could lead to unintentional exposure of personal data. Policies allow organizations to take corrective actions, such as restricting access or notifying content owners to review permissions.

- **Data transfer**: Monitors the movement of personal data across departments, regions, or beyond the organization. Alerts are triggered when data transfers, such as unencrypted emails containing sensitive data, violate internal policies or privacy regulations. Policies help prevent unauthorized or insecure transfers and promote compliance with data protection requirements.

- **Data minimization**: Identifies personal data that has been retained unnecessarily or remains unused over time. These policies help organizations manage or delete outdated data, reducing risks and meeting regulatory requirements for minimal retention of personal data.

This approach ensures organizations can proactively address privacy risks while aligning with their compliance and operational goals.
