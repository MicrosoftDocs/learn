quiz:
  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  
  - content: "An organization plans to implement Conditional Access. What do admins need to do?"
    choices:
    - content: "Create policies that enforce organizational rules."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Conditional Access is implemented using policies that enforce organizational rules."
    - content: "Check that all users have multifactor authentication enabled."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Conditional Access policies may require a user to sign in with multifactor authentication, but it isn't part of their implementation."
    - content: "Amend your apps to allow Conditional Access."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Conditional Access doesn't require apps to be changed in any way."
  
  - content: "Sign-in risk is a signal used by Conditional Access policies to decide whether to grant or deny access. What is sign-in risk?"
    choices:
    - content: "The probability that the device is owned by the identity owner."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Sign-in risk doesn't calculate any probability relating to usersâ€™ devices."
    - content: "The probability that the authentication request isn't authorized by the identity owner."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Sign-in risk is the real-time calculation that a given authentication request isn't authorized by the identity owner."
    - content: "The probability that the user is authorized to view data from a particular application."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Sign-in risk doesn't calculate the probability that a user is authorized to view data."
  
  - content: "IT admins have been asked to review Microsoft Entra roles assigned to users, to improve organizational security. Which of the following should they implement?"
    choices:
    - content: "Remove all global admin roles assigned to users."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. There should be the least number of global admin roles required for the organization, and a minimum of two."
    - content: "Create custom roles."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Custom roles give flexibility when granting access but aren't necessarily more secure than built-in roles."
    - content: "Replace global admin roles with specific Microsoft Entra roles."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. By following the least privilege security model and assigning specific admin roles, such as billing administrator or user administrator, to more users, instead of global admin roles, organizational security is improved."
  
  - content: "A network administrator is tasked with securing private resources in their organization. They decide to use Microsoft Entra Private Access and want to set up different access policies based on how resources are accessed or for a specific time frame. Which method should they use?"
    choices:
    - content: "Quick Access"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Quick Access doesn't provide the granularity needed for setting different access policies based on how resources are accessed or for a specific time frame."
    - content: "VPN"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. VPN is a method of network access, not a feature of Microsoft Entra Private Access that allows for granular control of access policies."
    - content: "Global Secure Access app"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. The Global Secure Access app, also referred to as Per-app Access, provides a more granular approach. The admin can create multiple enterprise apps and for each of these aps, assign users and groups and assign specific conditional access policies."
