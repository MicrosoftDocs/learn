  - content: "An organization plans to implement Conditional Access. What do admins need to do?"
    choices:
    - content: "Create policies that enforce organizational rules."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Conditional Access is implemented using policies that enforce organizational rules."
    - content: "Check that all users have multi-factor authentication enabled."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Conditional Access policies may require a user to sign in with multi-factor authentication, but it isn't part of their implementation."
    - content: "Amend your apps to allow Conditional Access."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Conditional Access doesn't require apps to be changed in any way."
  - content: "Sign-in risk is a signal used by Conditional Access policies to decide whether to grant or deny access. What is sign-in risk?"
    choices:
    - content: "The probability that the device is owned by the identity owner."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Sign-in risk doesn't calculate any probability relating to users’ devices."
    - content: "The probability that the authentication request isn't authorized by the identity owner."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Sign-in risk is the real-time calculation that a given authentication request isn't authorized by the identity owner."
    - content: "The probability that the user is authorized to view data from a particular application."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Sign-in risk doesn't calculate the probability that a user is authorized to view data."
  - content: "IT admins have been asked to review Microsoft Entra roles assigned to users, to improve organizational security. Which of the following should they implement?"
    choices:
    - content: "Remove all global admin roles assigned to users."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. There should be the least number of global admin roles required for the organization, and a minimum of two."
    - content: "Create custom roles."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Custom roles give flexibility when granting access but aren't necessarily more secure than built-in roles."
    - content: "Replace global admin roles with specific Microsoft Entra roles."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. By following the least privilege security model and assigning specific admin roles, such as billing administrator or user administrator, to more users, instead of global admin roles, organizational security is improved."
