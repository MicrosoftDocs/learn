  questions:
  - content: "The security admin has created an Azure Network Security Group (NSG) to filter network traffic to a virtual machine. The admin wants to allow inbound traffic using the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), but the default NSG rules are currently blocking all inbound traffic that is not from another virtual network or an Azure load balancer. What does the security admin have to do to allow inbound traffic using RDP?"
    choices:
    - content: "Delete the default rule."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The default rules can't be deleted."
    - content: "Create a new network security rule that allows RDP traffic and that has a higher priority than the default rule."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. You can create a new rule to allow RDP that has a higher priority than the default rule"
    - content: "There's nothing the admin can do, RDP traffic isn't supported with NSGs."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. NSG rules can be set allow RDP traffic"
  - content: "The security admin wants to protect Azure resources from DDoS attacks and needs logging, alerting, and telemetry capabilities. which Azure service can provide these capabilities?"

    - content: "DDoS Network Protection."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. DDoS Network Protection provides the default DDoS infrastructure-level protection plus advanced capabilities, including logging, alerting, and telemetry."
    - content: "Azure Bastion."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Azure Bastion is a service you deploy that lets you connect to a virtual machine using your browser and the Azure portal. Azure Bastion doesn't provide DDoS protection."
  - content: "An organization has several virtual machines in Azure. The security admin wants to deploy Azure Bastion to get secure access to those VMs. What should the admin keep in mind?"
    choices:
    - content: "Azure Bastion is deployed per virtual network, with support for virtual network peering."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Azure Bastion deployment is per virtual network with support for virtual network peering, not per subscription/account or virtual machine."
    - content: "Azure Bastion is deployed per subscription."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Azure Bastion deployment isn't per subscription/account."
    - content: "Azure Bastion is deployed per virtual machine."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Azure Bastion deployment isn't per virtual machine. Bastion provides secure RDP and SSH connectivity to all of the VMs in the virtual network in which it's provisioned."
  - content: "How can application developers benefit from using Azure Key Vault?"
    choices:
    - content: "To test and debug their application code."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Application developers can use Azure Key Vault to securely store and retrieve application secrets, such as database connection strings, without having to include it in the application code."
    - content: "To register their application with Azure"
      isCorrect: false
