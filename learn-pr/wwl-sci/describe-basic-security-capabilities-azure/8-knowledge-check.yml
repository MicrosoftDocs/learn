  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "You’re the Azure admin, and you want to increase the priority of a network security group, what five sources of information will you need to provide?"
    choices:
    - content: "source, source port, destination, destination port, and network layer."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. NSG security rules do not use the network layer as one of the five evaluation points."
    - content: "source, source port, destination, destination port, and protocol."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. NSG security rules are evaluated by priority using five information points: source, source port, destination, destination port, and protocol to either allow or deny the traffic."
    - content: "source, source port, destination, destination port, and target resource."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. NSG security rules do not use the target resource as one of the five evaluation points."
  - content: "You have an ever-growing list of resources in Azure. You want to protect your Azure resources from DDoS attacks, which Azure DDoS Protection tier will you use to target Azure Virtual Network resources?"
    choices:
    - content: "Basic."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The Basic service tier provides always-on traffic monitoring and real-time mitigation of common network-level attacks provide the same defenses that Microsoft’s online services use."
    - content: "Standard."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. The Standard service tier provides additional mitigation capabilities that are tuned specifically to Microsoft Azure Virtual Network resources."
    - content: "Advanced."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Azure DDoS Protection is available in only two tiers. Advanced is not a valid tier."
  - content: "You have several virtual machines in Azure. You want to deploy Azure Bastion to get secure access to your virtual machines in Azure. What limitation should you keep in mind?"
    choices:
    - content: "Azure Bastion is deployed per virtual network."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Azure Bastion deployment is per virtual network, not per subscription/account or virtual machine."
    - content: "Azure Bastion is deployed per subscription."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Azure Bastion deployment is not limited by subscription/account."
    - content: "Azure Bastion is deployed per virtual machine."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Azure Bastion deployment is not limited by virtual machine."
