  questions:
  
  - content: A security analyst is using Microsoft Security Copilot and wants to generate insights from their security data. They want to use natural language to do this. Where should they input their request?
    choices:
    - content: In the 'Prompt bar'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. The 'Prompt bar' is where users can input their requests in natural language to generate insights from their security data.
    - content: In the 'Prompts to try' section
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. The 'Prompts to try' section provides a set of prompts and promptbooks that are immediately available on the home screen, but it's not where users input their requests.
    - content: In the 'Workspaces' section
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. The 'Workspaces' section is for selecting available workspaces and setting preferred workspace, not for inputting requests.

  - content: A team member needs to set up a new workspace in Copilot for a specific project. What role must this team member have in order to create a new workspace?
    choices:
    - content: Security Reader
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. A security reader doesn't have the permissions to create a new workspace in Copilot. A user must have the security administrator role, as a minimum.
    - content: Security Administrator
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. A Security Administrator has the necessary permissions to create new workspaces in Copilot.
    - content: Billing Administrator
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. A billing administrator doesn't have the permissions to create a new workspace in Copilot. A user must have the security administrator role, as a minimum.

  - content: A security analyst needs to review past sessions created in Microsoft Security Copilot. After accessing the standalone experience, which option should they select to manage and review these sessions?
    choices:
    - content: Select the My sessions option from the home menu.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. My sessions allows users to manage and review past sessions with options to search, filter, rename, duplicate, or delete.
    - content: Select the Help icon.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. Help provides assistance and information about using the platform, not past session management.
    - content: Select settings.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. The settings option is for adjusting preferences and data privacy, not for reviewing past interactions.
  
  - content: A team member is trying to use a non-Microsoft plugin with Microsoft Security Copilot but it appears greyed out and restricted. What could be the possible reason?
    choices:
    - content: The plugin isn't supported by Microsoft Security Copilot.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. The plugin might be supported but appears restricted due to certain settings.
    - content: The plugin requires an account and license to the specific service.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. While some plugins do require an account and license, this wouldn't cause the plugin to appear grayed out and restricted.
    - content: The Copilot owner has restricted plugin access.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. If a Copilot owner has restricted plugin access, then those plugins that have been set to restricted will show greyed out.

  - content: A security analyst is tasked with automating investigation flows to streamline repetitive steps in Copilot. After selecting relevant prompts from an existing session, the analyst wants to create a promptbook. What should the analyst do next to accomplish this task?
    choices:
    - content: Select the 'Create promptbook' icon to open the page where they can name, tag, and further customize the promptbook.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. Select the 'Create promptbook' icon to open the page where they can name, tag, and further customize the promptbook.
    - content: Select the 'Export prompts' button to download the selected prompts for manual execution.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. Exporting prompts doesn't create a promptbook; it would only allow for manual use of the prompts outside of Copilot.
    - content: Choose the 'Save session' option to preserve the current state of the session for later use. 
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. Saving the session preserves its state but doesn't result in the creation of a promptbook.
