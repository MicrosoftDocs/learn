#### Other plugins

Other plugins give Copilot access to information and capabilities from services beyond Microsoft that your organization uses. Other plugins currently supported include:

- ServiceNow
- Splunk

Access to these plugins assumes an account and license to the specific service and a setup that includes authentication.  The type of authentication required is determined by the plugin provided.  For example, the ServiceNow plugin gives you the option to select from a Basic sign-in or OAuth authorization.

#### Websites

The websites plugins give Copilot access to industry information from the public web.   Currently, only the public web plugin is supported but additional website plugins are expected.

The website plugins are accessed using anonymous authentication.

#### Custom

The Microsoft Copilot for Security platform enables developers and users to write their own plugins that can be invoked to perform specialized tasks. There are two types of custom plugins:

- Custom Copilot plugins that you develop
- Custom plugins developed with OpenAIâ€™s API.

Regardless of the approach, every Copilot plugin requires a YAML or JSON formatted manifest file (for example: plugin.yaml or plugin.json) which describes metadata about the skill set and how to invoke the skills.

Once a custom plugin is added, it can be turned on or off, updated, or deleted.
