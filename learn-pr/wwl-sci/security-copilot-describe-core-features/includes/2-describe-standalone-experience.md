Microsoft Security Copilot can be accessed through the dedicated site https://securitycopilot.microsoft.com. This dedicated site is also referred to as the standalone experience. It is through the standalone experience that users access the landing page or portal to the platform. To ensure that the users can access the features of Copilot, they need to have the appropriate role permissions. For more information on role-based access control for Copilot, see the Assign roles section of [Understand authentication in Microsoft Security Copilot](/security-copilot/authentication?assign-roles).

There are some key landmarks on the Copilot landing page (portal) to which the user can navigate.

- Home menu
- Workspaces
- Prompts to try
- Prompt bar
- Help

### Home menu

The home menu is accessed by selecting the hamburger icon located on the top left corner of the Copilot landing page.

:::image type="content" source="../media/home-menu-icon-home-menu-options.png" lightbox="../media/home-menu-icon-home-menu-options-agents.png" alt-text="Screen capture showing the hamburger icon and the page it opens when selected.":::

From the home menu, the user can navigate as follows:

- Back to the landing page by selecting the Home icon.
- My sessions, which list past sessions created. The user can manage past sessions with search and filter options along with the ability to rename, duplicate, or delete sessions as needed. Currently sessions are kept on the My sessions page until they're manually deleted. When a session is deleted, all data associated with that session is marked as deleted and the time to live (TTL) is set to 30 days. After that TTL expires, queries can't access that data. Logs, which contain session data aren't affected when a session is deleted via the in-product UX. These logs have a retention period of up to 90 days.

  - Plugin settings. Owners configure the following:
      - Select who can add and manage their own custom plugins. The available options are Contributors and owners or owners only.
      - Select who can add and manage custom plugins for everyone in the organization. The available options are Contributors and owners or owners only.
      - Decide which new and existing plugins will be available to everyone in your organization, and which will be restricted to owners only.
      - Allow Security Copilot to access data from your Microsoft 365 services. If you choose not to allow Copilot access, users won't be able to use specific plugins, like Microsoft Purview, or connect any future sources of org knowledge that are housed in Microsoft 365 services.

  - Manage workspaces, where owners can create new workspaces, configure them by assigning access and permissions, and fine-tune settings such as owner roles and plugin configurations. Workspaces are described in more detail in the subsequent unit.
  
       :::image type="content" source="../media/workspace-manage.png" lightbox="../media/workspace-manage.png" alt-text="A screenshot of the manage workspaces page that lists the available workspaces.":::

  - Usage monitoring, which provides a dashboard showing how SCUs are consumed over a period of time by your Microsoft Security Copilot workloads. The usage monitoring dashboard provides visibility, for a selected workspace, into the number of units used, the specific plugins employed during sessions, and the initiators of those sessions. The dashboard also allows you to apply filters and export usage data seamlessly. The dashboard includes up to 90 days of data. When an analyst is in the middle of an investigation and the usage is nearing the provisioned capacity limit (90%), a notification is displayed to the analyst while entering the prompt. The notification informs the analyst to contact the owner to increase the capacity or limit the number of prompts to avoid disruptions. These notifications are also shown in the Security Copilot embedded experiences.
  
    When the provisioned capacity is crossed, the analyst sees an error message stating that due to high usage in organization, they cannot submit additional prompts. The analyst is asked to contact the owner to increase the provisioned SCUs.

- Tenant switcher. The tenant, which is provisioned for Copilot doesn't need to be the tenant your security analyst logs in from. In the screenshot that follows, security analyst Angus MacGregor uses a Fabrikam account to sign in. Copilot is provisioned in the Contoso tenant. By selecting the down arrow, Angus MacGregor is able to select the Contoso tenant.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/tenant-switcher-v3.png" lightbox="../media/tenant-switcher-v3.png" alt-text="Screen capture showing the tenant switching window, with multiple tenants listed.":::

### Workspaces

Copilot workspaces are separate work environments within the tenant in which your Copilot instance is operating. One way to think about Copilot workspaces is as separate rooms in a house. Each room is configured to be optimized for its function and the people that will use that room. The same is true of Copilot workspaces. Admins set up, configure, and manage individual workspaces for specific team needs.

Selecting workspaces opens the drop-down menu where users can select available workspaces to which they have access and set their preferred workspace in cases where they have access to multiple workspaces. Owners will also have the option to manage workspaces, manage capacity usage, and create a new workspace.

More detailed information is provided in a subsequent unit, dedicated to Copilot workspaces.

:::image type="content" source="../media/workspace-anchor.png" lightbox="../media/workspace-anchor.png" alt-text="A screenshot showing workspace drop-down menu that can be selected from the main landing page.":::

### Prompts to try

Prompts are the primary input Security Copilot needs to generate answers that can help you in your security-related tasks. Promptbooks are a series of prompts that have been put together to accomplish specific security-related tasks.

To help introduce the concept of prompting in Security Copilot, a set of prompts and promptbooks are immediately available on the home screen.

You can apply filters to find prompts or promptbooks that are most relevant to you. Narrow down search results by applying multiple filters to better suit your role or scenario.

Customize your search by selecting filters based on:

- Roles - Examples include: CISO, SOC analyst, threat intel analyst, and IT administrator.
- Plugins - Examples include: Microsoft Defender XDR, Microsoft Threat Intelligence, and Natural language to KQL for advanced hunting.

You can also use the search function to look up prompts or promptbooks by title.

### Prompt bar

You use the prompt bar to tell Copilot what insights you want from your security data, in natural language, then select the run icon.

:::image type="content" source="../media/prompt-bar-new.png" lightbox="../media/prompt-bar-new.png" alt-text="Screen capture showing the prompt bar.":::

In addition to the run icon, the prompt bar include two other icons:

- Prompt icon
- Sources icon

#### Prompt icon

Select the prompt icon located inside the prompt bar, to open a window where you search for and access promptbooks and system capabilities.

:::image type="content" source="../media/prompt-icon-mapping.png" lightbox="../media/prompt-icon-mapping.png" alt-text="Screen capture showing the prompt icon and the window it opens that shows promptbooks and system capabilities, when selected. ":::

System capabilities, often referred to as prompt suggestions, are specific, single prompts that you can use in Copilot. The list displayed when you select the prompt icon is a small subset of all the available system capabilities available to you. To view all the system capabilities available to you, select See all system capabilities. The list displayed may vary, depending on the plugins you enabled. There are some capabilities that aren't tied to a specific plugin and as such are available, independent of the enabled plugins, to users with access to Copilot.

Selecting a system capability (prompt suggestion) typically requires more input to get a useful response, but Copilot provides that guidance. As an example, the image that follows shows the information that the user must include to analyze a script or command.

:::image type="content" source="../media/system-capability-example.png" lightbox="../media/system-capability-example.png" alt-text="Screen capture showing the required input for the Analyze a script or command prompt suggestion.":::

#### Sources icon

Copilot integrates with security-specific sources using plugins and files.

- Plugins - Copilot currently supports plugins for Microsoft's own security products, non-Microsoft products, open-source intelligence feeds,  industry information from the public web, and custom plugins.

- Files - Connections to an organization's knowledge bases gives Copilot more context, resulting in responses that are more relevant, specific, and customized to the user. Uploading a file is one approach that Copilot uses to connect to an organization's knowledge base.

You access and manage sources through the sources icon that is included in the prompt bar. The Manage sources window lists the plugins tab (the default view) and the files tab.

:::image type="content" source="../media/manage-sources-icon-mapping-v3.png" lightbox="../media/manage-sources-icon-mapping-v3.png" alt-text="Screen capture showing the sources icon that when selected allows the user to select plugins or files. The default view opens to the plugins page.":::

Refer to subsequent units in this module for detailed information on plugins and connection to knowledge bases.

### Help

The help icon is located on the bottom right of the Copilot landing page.

:::image type="content" source="../media/help-icon-help-list.png" lightbox="../media/help-icon-help-list.png" alt-text="Screen capture showing the help icon and the help window.":::

By selecting the help icon, you can link to documentation and training, or if you encounter issues or need to seek assistance, Security Copilot provides a modern and advanced support experience. Depending on your role, the widget allows you to:

- **Find solutions to common problems**. Anyone with access to Security Copilot can access the self help widget by selecting the help icon then selecting the Help tab. Type your question in the prompt bar and articles related to your search will be surfaced.

- **Submit a support case to the Microsoft support team**. To open support cases, you must have, at a minimum, a Service Support Administrator OR Helpdesk Administrator role. You can also view your support history.
