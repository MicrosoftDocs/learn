Promptbooks in Copilot for Security are collections of prompts put together to accomplish specific security-related tasks. They run one prompt after another, building on previous responses.

You can create your own promptbook with the promptbook builder to automate investigation flows and optimize repetitive steps in Copilot that are customized to your needs and requirements. You can also share the promptbooks you created with other users so they can also benefit from your work.

### Create a promptbook from an existing session

To create your own promptbook, you can start with an existing session that contains the prompts you want to work with.  For this example, the session titled, "Show the last three failed login attempts," is used.

After selecting the desired session, select the boxes beside the prompts to include them or select the top box to include all prompts in the session. Selecting any or all of the prompts light up the Create promptbook button.

Once you select the create promptbook icon, the Create a promptbook page opens. Here you name the promptbook, add a tag and a description, add more prompts, and remove or edit existing prompts. If any of the prompts require an input parameter, you would need to specify an easily understood parameter name within angle brackets and no spaces. For example, if one of the prompts requires an incident ID number, you can specify \<IncidentID>. Similarly, if a prompt requires that you enter a threat actor name, you could specify the input parameter as \<threatactorname> or \<ThreatActor>. You can include more than one input parameter. You can also select to so share the promptbook with others in your organization or have it for your own personal use.

In the screen shot that follows, the promptbook is named Failed-Login-Attempts and it includes two prompts.  The first prompt includes the input parameter \<number>.

A pop-up window appears once your promptbook is created. From this window, you can immediately test the promptbook by selecting the copy icon that appears after the name.

From then on, you can run your promptbook like you would any other promptbook. You can select the asterisk (*) from the prompt bar and start typing in the name of the promptbook after the asterisk then  selecting it from the list that appears.
