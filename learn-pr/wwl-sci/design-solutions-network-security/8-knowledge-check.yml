quiz:
  questions:
    - content: "Which of the following correctly describes a good practice for network segmentation in Azure landing zones?"
      choices:
        - content: "Use one virtual network for all resources to simplify routing."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "A single virtual network can lead to complex routing tables and a lack of isolation for workloads. "
        - content: "Use separate virtual networks for each workload for maximum isolation."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Segmenting different workloads into separate virtual networks provides isolation and reduced attack surface."
        - content: "Use separate subnets within the same virtual network for each workload to reduce cost."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Using subnets can be a good way to split up a virtual network, but it does not provide the same level of isolation as using separate virtual networks."
        - content: "Allow all internal traffic by default to avoid configuration complexity."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Blocking unnecessary internal traffic can improve security and reduce complexity."
    - content: "What is a Network Security Group (NSG) used for in Azure?"
      choices:
        - content: "An NSG is used to deploy and manage firewall appliances in Azure."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "An NSG is a virtual firewall for filtering network traffic to and from Azure resources."
        - content: "An NSG is used to manage user access to Azure resources."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Azure Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is used to manage user permissions on Azure resources."
        - content: "An NSG is used to set inbound and outbound rules for network traffic."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "An NSG allows organizations to create inbound and outbound rules for network traffic to and from its resources in Azure."
        - content: "An NSG is used to connect virtual networks to other virtual networks or on-premises networks."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Azure VPN Gateway can be used to connect virtual networks to each other or to on-premises networks."
    - content: "What is traffic inspection, and why is it important in cloud environments?"
      choices:
        - content: "Traffic inspection is a method of observing traffic patterns to detect unauthorized activity."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Traffic inspection is a process of analyzing network traffic to detect and block potentially harmful traffic."
        - content: "Traffic inspection is used to monitor internet traffic for content filters and application controls."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Content filtering and application control are important use cases for traffic inspection, but they do not cover the full scope of its functionality."
        - content: "Traffic inspection is used to detect and prevent attacks before they reach their targets."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Traffic inspection can detect and prevent attacks such as DDoS, port scans, and malware infections before they reach their intended targets."
        - content: "Traffic inspection is used to segregate public-facing services from private ones to reduce attack surfaces."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Segregating public-facing services from private ones is an important security consideration, but it is not the primary purpose of traffic inspection."
    - content: What does the interactive network map in Microsoft Defender for Cloud provide?
      choices:
        - content: It provides a graphical view with security overlays giving recommendations and insights for hardening network resources.
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: Correct. The interactive network map provides a graphical view with security overlays, showing the network topology of Azure workloads, connections between virtual machines and subnets, and recommendations for specific resources.
        - content: It provides a list of all the users connected to the network.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. The network map does not provide a list of users, but rather a graphical view with security overlays giving recommendations and insights for hardening network resources.
        - content: It provides a real-time traffic analysis of the network.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. While the network map does provide a view of possible traffic between resources, it does not provide real-time traffic analysis.
