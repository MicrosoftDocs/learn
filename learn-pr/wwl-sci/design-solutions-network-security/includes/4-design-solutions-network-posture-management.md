Microsoft Defender for DNS provides an additional layer of protection for resources that use Azure DNS's [Azure-provided name resolution](/azure/virtual-network/virtual-networks-name-resolution-for-vms-and-role-instances#azure-provided-name-resolution) capability.

From within Azure DNS, Defender for DNS monitors the queries from these resources and detects suspicious activities without the need for any additional agents on your resources.

-   **Data exfiltration** from your Azure resources using DNS tunneling
-   **Malware** communicating with command and control servers
