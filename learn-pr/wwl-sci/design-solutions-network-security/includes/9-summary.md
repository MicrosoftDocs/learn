In this module, you have learned about the various features Azure offers for network security segmentation, including Subscriptions, Virtual Networks (VNets), Network Security Groups (NSGs), Application Security Groups (ASGs), and Azure Firewall. You've also explored the three common patterns for segmenting a workload in Azure: Single VNet, Multiple VNets with peering, and Multiple VNets in a hub and spoke model. Additionally, you've delved into the functionalities of Azure network security groups and Microsoft Defender for DNS, both crucial for maintaining network security.

The main takeaways from this module include understanding how to use Azure's segmentation features to secure your network and resources. You've learned how to choose the appropriate segmentation pattern based on your operational needs. You've also gained knowledge on how to use Azure network security groups to filter network traffic and how Microsoft Defender for DNS adds an extra layer of protection to your resources. Furthermore, you've learnt about the importance of capturing and analyzing network traffic in real-time using Azure VPN Gateway and Azure Network Watcher. Lastly, you've understood how Microsoft Entra Internet Access and Microsoft Entra Private Access can enhance your organization's internet security and manage access to private apps and resources respectively.
