Organizations face growing demands to investigate internal and external data-related risks. Whether responding to legal inquiries, regulatory audits, or internal security incidents, having a clear process for preserving, searching, and reviewing content is essential. Without a structured and secure way to manage investigations, organizations risk overlooking key evidence or mishandling sensitive data.

Microsoft Purview eDiscovery provides a centralized way to manage investigation workflows. It helps legal, compliance, and security teams collaborate, control access, and take action on potentially relevant content. Teams must set up and configure cases that define the scope and permissions for each investigation before collecting or reviewing data.

By using eDiscovery cases in Microsoft Purview, organizations can:

- Create secure workspaces to manage searches, holds, and review sets.
- Assign access to the right individuals or role groups for each investigation.
- Configure advanced case settings to control analytics, data sources, and review behaviors.
