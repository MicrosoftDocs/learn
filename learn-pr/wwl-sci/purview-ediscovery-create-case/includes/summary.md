Effective investigations depend on clear boundaries, defined access, and consistent case setup. Microsoft Purview eDiscovery provides a structured approach for managing investigations while protecting sensitive content.

This module showed how to:

- Complete key prerequisites for using eDiscovery, including licensing, permissions, and global settings.
- Create and manage eDiscovery cases that serve as workspaces for investigation tasks.
- Control who can access a case by adding users, assigning role groups, and managing guest access.
- Configure case settings to tailor search behavior, enable analytics, and optimize review workflows.

By following these practices, your organization can run efficient, secure investigations that meet legal and regulatory expectations.
