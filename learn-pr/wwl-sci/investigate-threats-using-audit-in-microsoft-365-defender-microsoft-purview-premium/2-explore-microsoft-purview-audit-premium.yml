  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "Fabrikam has implemented Microsoft Purview Audit (Premium). It now wants to create appropriate 10-year audit log retention policies for the managers of its security and compliance teams. What must Fabrikam do to enable this functionality?"
    choices:
    - content: "Configure the 10 year audit log setting in the Microsoft Purview compliance portal"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. There's no such setting in the Microsoft Purview compliance portal."
    - content: "Purchase per-user add-on licenses for each manager"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. In addition to the one-year retention capabilities of Audit (Premium), Microsoft 365 can optionally retain audit logs for 10 years. The 10-year retention of audit logs helps support long running investigations and respond to regulatory, legal, and internal obligations. Retaining audit logs for 10 years requires an extra per-user add-on license. After this license is assigned to a user and an appropriate 10-year audit log retention policy is set for that user, audit logs covered by that policy will start to be retained for the 10-year period."
    - content: "Nothing extra is needed since audit logs are retained by default for 10 years when Audit (Premium) is licensed"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Audit logs are retained by default for one year in Audit (Premium)."
