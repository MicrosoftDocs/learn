Web trackers like cookies, device fingerprinting, and web beacons play a critical role in delivering personalization, analytics, and advertising. However, they can raise privacy concerns when users don't know they're being tracked or can't control how their data is used. Organizations must address these concerns while maintaining transparency and trust with their users.

Microsoft Priva Tracker Scanning helps organizations automatically detect, categorize, and manage tracking technologies on their websites. With this tool, you can create a complete inventory of trackers, understand their purpose, and ensure they're used responsibly. Tracker Scanning enables organizations to maintain visibility into their web tracking practices and better align with user expectations, fostering responsible data practices.

## Scenario
