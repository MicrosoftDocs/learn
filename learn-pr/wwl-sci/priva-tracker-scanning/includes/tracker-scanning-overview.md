Managing web tracker compliance can be a challenge for organizations. With the increasing number of websites, rapidly evolving technologies, and rising privacy expectations, keeping track of tracking technologies and ensuring compliance is more complex than ever.

Microsoft Priva Tracker Scanning (preview) helps organizations simplify this process. The tool automates the identification and management of web trackers across registered domains, giving organizations the visibility they need to align their tracking practices with privacy standards. By providing insights into how trackers are categorized and deployed, Tracker Scanning supports more responsible and transparent data practices.

## Key features of tracker scanning

Microsoft Priva Tracker Scanning offers several features to support website compliance and tracker management:

- **Automate tracker detection and categorization**: Automatically scan your registered domains to identify tracking technologies and categorize them based on their purpose.
- **Evaluate and manage tracker compliance**: Configure flexible scans to detect missing privacy elements, such as consent notices or privacy policy links, across your websites.
- **Streamline compliance monitoring**: Identify areas of noncompliance and track issues throughout the website lifecycle.

Additional tools include:

- A **common tracker database** to provide examples of widely used trackers for reference.
- A **custom tracker library** to manage your organization's trackers and define which ones to deploy on new or updated websites.

- **Digital fingerprints**: Browser and device data used to uniquely identify a device.
- **Local storage objects**: Data stored locally on a user's device, often to save preferences or enable website functionality.
- **Web beacons**: Clear graphic images, such as pixels, used to measure website activity or track ad performance.

Microsoft Priva Tracker Scanning provides organizations with the tools they need to manage and evaluate web tracking technologies effectively. By automating the identification and categorization of trackers, the tool helps ensure that tracking practices are transparent and aligned with privacy expectations.

Now that you understand what Tracker Scanning is and how it works, you're ready to configure it for your organization.
