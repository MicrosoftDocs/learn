Managing web trackers across websites can be challenging, especially as privacy expectations grow and regulations evolve. Without visibility into trackers, organizations risk noncompliance, eroding user trust, and creating inefficiencies in tracking management. Microsoft Priva Tracker Scanning addresses these challenges by providing tools to detect, categorize, manage, and analyze tracking technologies effectively.

This module demonstrated how Tracker Scanning helps organizations simplify web tracking compliance by automating detection, categorization, analysis, and management of trackers. With features like automated scans, tracker categorization, detailed scan results, and integration with consent management, Priva enables organizations to align their practices with privacy standards while fostering user trust.
