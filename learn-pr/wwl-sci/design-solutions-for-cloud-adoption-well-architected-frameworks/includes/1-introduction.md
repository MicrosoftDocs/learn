As a cybersecurity architect, you need to design security solutions that align with established frameworks and best practices. Microsoft provides two key frameworks that guide security architecture decisions: the Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework for Azure (CAF) and the Microsoft Azure Well-Architected Framework (WAF).

These frameworks help organizations establish consistent security practices across their cloud environments, from initial planning through ongoing operations. Understanding how these frameworks intersect with security design enables you to create solutions that are both secure and aligned with organizational cloud adoption goals.

## Scenario

Imagine you're a cybersecurity architect at a large enterprise organization that's expanding its Azure cloud presence. Your organization is planning to deploy new workloads, including AI-based applications, while modernizing existing security practices. Leadership has asked you to ensure all new deployments align with industry best practices and organizational security standards.

You need to understand how the Cloud Adoption Framework's security guidance and the Well-Architected Framework's Security pillar work together to create comprehensive security architectures. Additionally, you need to address the unique security considerations for AI workloads that your organization plans to adopt.

## Learning objectives

By the end of this module, you're able to:

- Describe the Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework and its security methodology.
- Design secure Azure landing zones using CAF design areas.
- Apply the Well-Architected Framework Security pillar design principles.
- Design security solutions for AI workloads using CAF guidance.

## Prerequisites

- Conceptual knowledge of security policies, requirements, Zero Trust architecture, and management of hybrid environments.
- Working experience with Zero Trust principles, applying security policies, and developing security requirements based on business goals.
