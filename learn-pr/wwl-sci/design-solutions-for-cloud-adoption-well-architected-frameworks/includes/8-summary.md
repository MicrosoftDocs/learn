In this module, you learned how to design security solutions that align with the Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework for Azure and the Microsoft Azure Well-Architected Framework. These frameworks provide comprehensive guidance for building secure cloud environments that support organizational goals.

## Key takeaways

- The **Cloud Adoption Framework** consists of seven methodologies, with the Secure methodology providing guidance for security posture modernization, incident preparedness, and Zero Trust alignment.

- **Azure landing zones** provide a standardized foundation for workloads, with eight design areas that address security, identity, networking, governance, and other critical concerns.

- The **Well-Architected Framework Security pillar** defines five design principles: plan your security readiness, design to protect confidentiality, design to protect integrity, design to protect availability, and sustain and evolve your security posture.

- **Zero Trust principles** (verify explicitly, use least privilege access, assume breach) are embedded throughout both frameworks and should guide all security architecture decisions.

- **AI workloads** can be secured using CAF's Secure AI guidance, which focuses on discovering risks, protecting resources and data, and detecting threats. AI deployments should leverage the existing Azure landing zone architecture rather than requiring separate infrastructure.

- **DevSecOps processes** integrate security throughout the software development lifecycle. By shifting security left and embedding automated security checks in CI/CD pipelines, organizations catch vulnerabilities early and deploy secure code consistently. CAF provides guidance on toolchain selection, policy-as-code, and security team roles in DevSecOps.

- The **CIA triad** (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability) remains fundamental to security design, and both frameworks reinforce these principles in their guidance.
