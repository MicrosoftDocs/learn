      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Remember to think broadly about devices. This helps you to better identify potential threat vectors."
  - content: "What is device hardening?"
    choices:

      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This isn't device hardening."
    - content: "Minimizing device vulnerabilities."

    - content: "When a device is at its end of support and no longer receives updates."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This isn't device hardening."
  - content: "What is jailbreaking?"
    choices:
    - content: "When a user runs only a single application on a device at a time."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. That's not jailbreaking"
    - content: "When a user finds a way to run multiple applications on multiple devices at the same time."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. That's not jailbreaking"
    - content: "When a user finds unofficial methods to get full access to the core systems of the device."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. This makes the device vulnerable, because it may circumvent security measures and offers opportunities for cybercriminals to provide false guidance or software to compromise a device."
