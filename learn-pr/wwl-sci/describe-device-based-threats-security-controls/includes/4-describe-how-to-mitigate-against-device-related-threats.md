We've learned that devices can be threat vectors for cybercriminals who want to gain access to, or control of, data to cause harm. But what can we do to protect ourselves?

## Mitigation measures

There are different ways to protect devices and data. Let’s look at a few of the common ones:

### Device hardening

Device hardening is how you minimize the possibility of having device vulnerabilities that can be exploited.
You can use the following methods:

- Make sure devices have the latest security updates.
- Turn off any unused devices.
- Enable security features supported through the device operating system.
- Require PIN or biometrics, such as facial recognition, to access devices.

Many modern operating systems have capabilities that support device hardening. For example, users can enable automatic operating system updates to help protect against known vulnerabilities and ensure continued availability of the device. Updates also support security features such as virus and threat protection, and firewall functionality.

These features are easily enabled and can help keep your connected device secure to maintain the confidentiality and integrity of accessible data.

### Encryption

Encryption is a process that turns information on the device into unintelligible data. The only way to make this information useful is to reverse the encryption. This requires a specific password or key that's only available to the authorized user. When the information is encrypted, it becomes useless without the correct key or password.  This way, data confidentiality is maintained.
The contents of a device can be encrypted in many different ways. For example, some operating systems come with built-in tools that enable you to encrypt your computer’s hard drive or any storage device you connect to it.

### Limit application device access

So far, we've looked at the different ways in which applications and devices might be compromised, and the steps you can take to mitigate threats. However, one of the more overlooked attack vectors is when someone directly uses your apps on the physical device. 

Suppose you've left your smartphone on the desk and hurried off for an urgent meeting. A bad actor could use your phone to access any of your apps. They could send messages, access bank accounts, and make purchases—all by using apps from your device. If they're smart, they'd leave the device where they found it, so you would never know.

This threat also applies to your work computer. Suppose you're busy working on important and sensitive data, and step away from your computer to get a coffee. A criminal could now use the unsecured computer to look up secret or sensitive data, or download it to a USB drive.

In these two cases, everything the bad actor does will be logged and tracked in your name. There's little chance that the bad actor's actions will be traced back to them, and you'll have to deal with the fallout and clean-up.

The best way to limit access to your applications is to ensure that they're closed or secured when you aren't using them. You do this by locking a device when you step away from it. If the device is small enough, keep it with you.
