Contoso Ltd. is developing an internal AI assistant using **Azure AI Foundry**. The assistant generates text responses for customer support teams and draws from internal product data to answer questions accurately. Before deployment, the information security administrator must configure and validate guardrails to prevent unsafe, ungrounded, or policy-violating responses. The goal is to balance safety and usability while ensuring that sensitive data is never exposed through prompts or model outputs.
