## Programmatic administration

You can also manage access packages, catalogs, policies, requests, and assignments using Microsoft Graph. A user in an appropriate role with an application that has the delegated `EntitlementManagement.ReadWrite.All` permission can call the [entitlement management API](/graph/tutorial-access-package-api).
