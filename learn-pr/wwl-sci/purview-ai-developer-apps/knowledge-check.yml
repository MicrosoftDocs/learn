  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "Contoso developers build an agent in Copilot Studio that connects to a SharePoint site. The SharePoint site includes documents labeled as Highly Confidential. What feature should Contoso use to ensure the agent doesn't summarize these files?"
    choices:
    - content: "Sensitivity labels with access restrictions"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Sensitivity labels can enforce access and summarization restrictions on agents."
    - content: "Sensitivity labels with policy tips"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Policy tips only provide guidance. You need enforcement to restrict summarization."
    - content: "Microsoft Entra Conditional Access"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Conditional Access controls user access, not how agents interact with labeled files."

  - content: "A developer at Fabrikam creates an AI agent that sends sensitive data to a non-Microsoft AI tool in Microsoft Edge. What Microsoft Purview feature helps block this behavior for users at high risk?"
    choices:
    - content: "eDiscovery holds"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "eDiscovery holds preserve data but don't enforce policy actions like blocking."
    - content: "Audit logging for AI interactions"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Audit logging provides visibility, but it doesn't block the action."
    - content: "Adaptive Protection in DLP"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Adaptive Protection can apply stricter enforcement like blocking risky users from sending sensitive data."

  - content: "A compliance analyst wants to investigate whether users have submitted prompts with offensive or misleading content to AI tools. Which Microsoft Purview solution helps with this task?"
    choices:
    - content: "Communication Compliance"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Communication Compliance surfaces prompts that include harmful, offensive, or inappropriate input."
    - content: "Audit"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Audit shows metadata for prompts, but not the content of the prompts."
    - content: "Insider Risk Management"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Insider Risk Management looks at risky patterns but not prompt content itself."

  - content: "A developer registers an AI app through Microsoft Entra that accesses Microsoft 365 data. What Microsoft Purview capability helps the organization understand the data risks this app introduces?"
    choices:
    - content: "DSPM for AI"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Data Security Posture Management (DSPM) for AI surfaces apps and assesses how they use sensitive data."
    - content: "Adaptive Protection enforcement"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Adaptive Protection is used for applying protection based on user risk level, not assessing apps."
    - content: "Communication Compliance"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Communication Compliance evaluates prompt content, not app-level risks."

  - content: "A security team reviews DSPM for AI data risk assessments for a SharePoint site used by a Copilot Studio agent. They notice several overshared files with no labels. What should they do to reduce the risk of unintended exposure?"
    choices:
    - content: "Restrict AI access to the SharePoint site"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That limits AI use, but the broader issue is unprotected content."
    - content: "Apply sensitivity labels to the files"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Labeling the files helps control how the content is used and summarized by agents."
    - content: "Export the site's audit logs"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Audit logs provide visibility but won't protect the files or change AI behavior."
