Developers can use Azure AI services and Azure AI Foundry to build custom apps that generate responses based on organizational data. These apps often rely on models like GPT through Azure OpenAI and might connect to sensitive data sources that include regulated or business-critical content.

It's important to ensure that content generated or accessed by these apps is protected. Microsoft Purview supports policy enforcement for data loss prevention, retention, and investigations across apps built with Azure AI.

## Onboard Azure AI apps to Microsoft Purview

Before you can apply protections, apps built with Azure AI must be onboarded into Microsoft Purview.

If the app is registered in Microsoft Entra ID, onboarding typically involves:

- Authorizing access to Microsoft 365 data
- Assigning the required API permissions, such as **Mail.Read** or **Sites.Read.All**
- Making sure Purview-supported signals are enabled for the app

For apps that use data sources outside of Microsoft 365, such as files stored in Azure or on external services, you might need to configure Data Security Posture Management for (DSPM) for AI collection policies. These policies allow you to capture prompt activity and file access from Azure-hosted apps so they can appear in Microsoft Purview.

Once onboarded, apps become visible in DSPM for AI reports and can be included in policy scopes for DLP and other Microsoft Purview tools.

## Apply DLP policies to Azure AI apps

Data loss prevention (DLP) policies help you detect and restrict how Azure AI apps interact with sensitive content. If an app accesses Microsoft 365 data, you can apply policies that trigger when:

- Files with sensitivity labels are accessed
- Confidential content is used in a generated response
- Protected data is sent or shared by the app

You can scope DLP policies to apply to Microsoft Entra-registered apps, including those built with Azure AI services. These policies can audit or block actions such as copying, summarizing, or storing protected content.

If you use DSPM for AI collection policies to capture prompts and responses, you can create DLP rules that inspect the text generated by the app. For example, you could create a policy that detects when a response includes personal identifiers or financial information pulled from a protected SharePoint site.

## Retain and investigate AI content with Microsoft Purview

Captured prompts and responses from Azure AI apps can be retained and investigated using Microsoft Purview.

Retention policies allow you to preserve this content for a defined period based on your organization's compliance or business requirements. You can apply retention across all collected AI interactions or scope it to specific users, apps, or data types.

Captured content is also available in **eDiscovery**. You can use it to:

- Search for prompts or responses based on keywords, users, or time ranges
- Review AI interactions alongside other content like email or documents
- Export results for legal or compliance investigations

Even if the AI app is hosted outside Microsoft 365, using Microsoft Purview ensures that the data it accesses or generates can still be retained and made available for compliance, audit, or security response.
