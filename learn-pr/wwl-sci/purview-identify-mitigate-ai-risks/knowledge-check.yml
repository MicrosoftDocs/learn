  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "Your organization is concerned about AI-related data security risks. How does Microsoft Purview Data Security Posture Management (DSPM) for AI help mitigate these risks?"
    choices:
    - content: "It provides visibility into AI interactions, enforces security policies, and prevents unauthorized data exposure."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct: DSPM for AI helps organizations track AI usage, apply security controls, and ensure compliance with data protection policies."
    - content: "It blocks all AI activity by default to prevent security risks."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect: DSPM for AI doesn't block AI activity by default but provides monitoring and policy enforcement to reduce risks."
    - content: "It replaces traditional data loss prevention (DLP) policies with AI-specific rules."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect: DSPM for AI works alongside DLP policies but doesn't replace them."

  - content: "A security team wants to track non-Microsoft AI usage in the organization. What prerequisite should they configure?"
    choices:
    - content: "Enable Microsoft Defender for Endpoint."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect: While Defender provides security protections, it isn't required for DSPM for AI to track AI activity."
    - content: "Assign Microsoft Copilot licenses to all users."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect: Copilot licenses are required for Microsoft 365 Copilot usage but don't enable tracking of non-Microsoft AI tools."
    - content: "Install the Microsoft Purview browser extension."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct: The browser extension is required to monitor non-Microsoft AI site visits and interactions."

  - content: "Your organization wants to prevent AI tools from summarizing sensitive files in SharePoint. Which DSPM for AI feature helps with this?"
    choices:
    - content: "AI-generated content review"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect: While DSPM for AI helps monitor AI-generated content, DLP policies specifically enforce restrictions on AI interactions."
    - content: "Data loss prevention (DLP) policies"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct: DSPM for AI integrates with DLP policies to prevent AI tools like Copilot from summarizing labeled or classified content."
    - content: "Activity Explorer tracking"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect: Activity Explorer helps investigate AI interactions but doesn't enforce data security policies."

  - content: "A security analyst needs to review AI usage trends across Microsoft 365 Copilot and non-Microsft AI tools. Which report should they use?"
    choices:
    - content: "Total interactions over time"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct: This report provides insights into AI usage patterns, helping security teams monitor adoption and detect anomalies."
    - content: "Sensitive interactions per AI app"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect: This report focuses on AI applications that process sensitive data, not overall AI usage trends."
    - content: "Top sensitivity labels referenced in Copilot"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect: This report highlights labeled content referenced in Copilot but doesn't track overall AI usage."

  - content: "What is the purpose of AI data assessments in DSPM for AI?"
    choices:
    - content: "To block AI-generated content from being saved in SharePoint."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect: Data assessments identify security risks but don't block AI-generated content."
    - content: "To delete all files accessed by AI tools."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect: Data assessments don't delete files but provide insights into AI-related security risks."
    - content: "To identify sensitive data that AI tools might access and help enforce security controls."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct: AI data assessments help security teams identify and mitigate risks related to AI interactions with sensitive data."
