AI-powered tools create security and compliance risks that traditional controls donâ€™t fully address. Without visibility into AI interactions, security teams struggle to track data exposure, prevent unauthorized access, and enforce policies to protect sensitive information.

Microsoft Purview Data Security Posture Management (DSPM) for AI helps organizations secure AI interactions by providing insights, security policies, and compliance controls. With DSPM for AI, security teams can monitor AI activity, detect security risks, and apply protections to AI-generated content.

In this module, you learned how to:

- Identify security risks in AI interactions
- Monitor AI usage and enforce security policies
- Protect sensitive data in AI-generated content
- Run data assessments to detect oversharing risks
- Use reports to track AI activity and strengthen compliance

Without DSPM for AI, organizations would have to rely on manual processes to monitor AI interactions, making it harder to detect security risks before they become problems. Using DSPM for AI makes it easier to track AI usage, enforce security policies, and keep sensitive data protected.
