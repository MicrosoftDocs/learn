      explanation: "Incorrect: Data products package assets for use, but they rely on glossary terms for consistent definitions."

      explanation: "Incorrect: Data stewards curate assets and assign terms but don't validate them against business usage."

  - content: "Analysts at Contoso want a single, trusted source that combines finance and sales customer records into one governed dataset. Which Unified Catalog element should a steward create?"

  - content: "While curating data, AI in Unified Catalog proposes links between assets and glossary terms. What should governance teams do with these AI suggestions?"
    choices:
    - content: "Review and validate them before adoption"
