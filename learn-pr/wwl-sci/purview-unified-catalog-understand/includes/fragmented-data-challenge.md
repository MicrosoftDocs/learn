Organizations depend on data for decisions, but when that data is fragmented across systems, it becomes hard to manage and trust. Many organizations spread data across databases, cloud services, SaaS apps, and on-premises systems. This variety supports business needs but also creates fragmentation. When data is scattered, it's harder to know what exists, who owns it, and whether it can be trusted.

## Fragmentation in practice

Imagine a company where finance, sales, and operations each store customer records in separate systems. Each system defines _active customer_ differently. Reports don't match, teams question the numbers, and decision-making slows down as data must be reconciled manually.

This fragmentation leads to challenges like:

- **Limited visibility**: Each department sees only its own data, making it hard to understand the full picture.

- **Inconsistent definitions**: Terms like _customer_ or _product_ aren't defined consistently, leading to confusion in reports.

- **Unclear ownership**: No clear accountability for data accuracy across systems.

- **Reduced trust**: Business leaders hesitate to act on conflicting data.

- **Compliance gaps**: Sensitive data might lack consistent controls, raising risk of exposure.

Together, these issues prevent organizations from treating data as a trusted asset.

## Why governance matters

Data governance addresses fragmentation by introducing structure and accountability. It establishes shared terminology, assigns ownership, and enforces consistent policies for quality and access. Governance isn't a barrier. It's the framework that makes data useful and trusted.

Governance directly solves the challenges of fragmentation:

- **Limited visibility → Better discoverability**: Users can find the data they need across systems.

- **Inconsistent definitions → Shared understanding**: Key terms like _customer_ or _product_ are defined consistently.

- **Unclear ownership → Clear accountability**: Roles are assigned so data accuracy is maintained.

- **Reduced trust → Trusted data**: Reliable information supports reporting, analytics, and decisions.

- **Compliance gaps → Consistent controls**: Policies apply across the data estate to reduce risk.

The result is a data estate that supports accurate reporting and confident decision-making. Microsoft Purview Unified Catalog puts this governance framework into practice by centralizing assets, adding shared context, and applying consistent controls.
