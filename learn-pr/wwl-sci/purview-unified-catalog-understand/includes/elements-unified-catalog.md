The Unified Catalog is built on elements that bring structure, context, and consistency to data. These elements work together so both governance teams and business users can rely on trusted information.

## Data assets: the foundation

The starting point for the Unified Catalog is the **Microsoft Purview Data Map**. The Data Map scans and inventories data sources across your estate, from on-premises systems to cloud services. Every file, table, or dataset captured in the Data Map becomes a **data asset** in the Unified Catalog.

This inventory layer is comprehensive. It represents the _entire_ data estate, not just curated or high-value items. For governance teams, it establishes visibility into what exists, where it lives, and how it flows. For business users, it provides the raw material that can later be organized into more meaningful forms.

## Data products: curated for use

While the Data Map inventories everything, not all data is ready for broad consumption. **Data products** package related assets for a specific use case. For example, instead of a marketing analyst searching across multiple raw datasets, a steward can create a _Customer Insights_ product that combines customer records, transactions, and loyalty data into one governed, reliable source.

## Adding business context

To make assets and data products meaningful, the Unified Catalog adds layers of context:

- **[Glossary terms](/purview/unified-catalog-glossary-terms)** define business language consistently so terms like _customer_ or _account_ mean the same across departments.

- **[Governance domains](/purview/unified-catalog-governance-domains)** group assets into business areas such as finance, HR, or sales, helping users navigate by topic.

- **[Critical data elements (preview)](/purview/unified-catalog-critical-data-elements)** highlight high-value fields like _customer ID_ or _account number_ that require extra oversight.

These layers of context reduce confusion, reinforce consistent usage, and help both governance teams and business users understand not just where data lives, but what it represents.

## Governance in action

Controls in the Unified Catalog ensure that data is both cataloged and governed:

- **[Access policies](/purview/unified-catalog-data-product-access-policies)** manage who can use data products and concepts such as domains or glossary terms.

- **[Objectives and key results (OKRs)](/purview/unified-catalog-okrs)** connect governance activities to measurable business goals.

- **[Data quality health report](/purview/unified-catalog-reports-data-quality-health)** shows whether data meets standards for accuracy, completeness, and reliability.

- **[Data governance health report (preview)](/purview/unified-catalog-reports-data-governance)** shows the overall state of governance across domains and highlights areas that need attention.

Together, these elements bridge the gap between raw data and business-ready insights. The Data Map inventories everything, data products make curated data accessible, and governance concepts provide the consistency needed to turn data into a trusted asset. With the building blocks in place, the next step is to see how different roles use them to turn raw data into business value
