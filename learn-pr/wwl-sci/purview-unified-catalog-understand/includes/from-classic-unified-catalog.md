The classic Microsoft Purview catalog was centered on the **Data Map**, which supported discovery, classification, and lineage tracking. It gave organizations visibility into where data resided and how it moved, but it provided limited business context and governance capabilities.

The **Unified Catalog** keeps the Data Map as its foundation and extends it with stronger governance, reporting, and collaboration features.

| **Data Map** provided discovery, classification, and lineage | **Data Map** remains the foundation and adds governance concepts, curated products, and health reporting |
| **Metadata** focused mainly on technical details | **Metadata** enriched with business context |
| **Governance features** were limited | **Governance features** expanded with access controls, objectives, and reporting  |
| **Collaboration** designed mainly for technical users  | **Collaboration** extended to multiple personas: owners, stewards, business experts, and consumers |
| **Catalog** served as an inventory of assets | **Catalog** redefined as curated, governed data products |

## Limitations of the classic catalog

The classic catalog could scan sources and register assets, but it struggled to scale governance:

- Business context was limited, making it hard to connect assets to shared definitions.
- Governance options were basic, with few ways to apply consistent policies or track progress.
- Collaboration was narrow, often leaving business users without a clear way to engage.

## How the Unified Catalog expands the experience

The Unified Catalog closes these gaps by extending the Data Map with curated products, governance elements, and shared workspaces. AI-assisted curation reduces manual effort, and role alignment brings technical and business users together in one environment.

## Why the shift matters

The classic catalog was an inventory. The Unified Catalog turns that inventory into a governed framework where both technical and business roles can collaborate with confidence, knowing the data they use is consistent and trusted.

This shift is part of a bigger story about why unifying your entire data estate matters for the organization.
