The classic Microsoft Purview catalog experience was centered on the **Data Map**. This provided discovery of assets, automated classification, and lineage tracking across the data estate. It gave organizations visibility into where data lived and how it moved, but it was limited in scope and didn't provide a full governance framework.

The **Unified Catalog** keeps the Data Map as its foundation and extends it with governance and business context. New capabilities include **governance domains, glossary terms, policies, health management, and curated data products**. These features expand the catalog beyond technical metadata to include business meaning and governed use.

| Classic catalog experience | Unified Catalog |
|-----|-----|
| Centered on the **Data Map** for discovery, classification, and lineage | Builds on the Data Map and layers in governance domains, glossary terms, policies, and health management |
| Focused mainly on **technical metadata** | Adds **business context** with glossary definitions, domains, and critical data elements |
| Limited governance features, mostly classification and basic access  | Governance through access policies, OKRs, and health reports |
| Collaboration focused on technical users | Designed for multiple personas: owners, stewards, business experts, and consumers |
| Catalog as an inventory of assets | Catalog as governed, curated data products |

## Limitations of the classic catalog

The classic catalog allowed teams to scan sources, register assets, and apply classifications. However, many organizations found gaps when trying to scale governance:

- Business context was limited. Metadata could be discovered, but it was harder to connect assets to business definitions or critical data elements.
- Governance features were basic. There were fewer options for applying consistent access policies or tying governance to measurable objectives.
- Collaboration was minimal. Technical users could see the catalog, but business users often struggled to understand or apply the information.
- Scalability was challenging. As estates grew, the catalog became harder to manage consistently across domains and user groups.

## How the Unified Catalog expands the experience

The Unified Catalog addresses these gaps by layering governance concepts and user experiences on top of the Data Map foundation:

- **Governance domains and glossary terms**: Provide business context so assets are meaningful across departments.
- **Policies and health reports**: Apply consistent governance and give visibility into data quality and compliance.
- **Data products**: Package related assets into curated, governed sets for analysts, developers, and other consumers.
- **AI-assisted curation**: Simplify discovery and enrichment, reducing manual work for stewards.
- **Role alignment**: Owners, stewards, experts, and consumers work together in the same environment with shared visibility and responsibilities.

## Why the shift matters

In the classic catalog, cataloging focused on discovery, classification, and lineage. In the Unified Catalog, those capabilities remain but are extended with governance layers that make data easier to manage across teams. By adding business context, consistent policies, and curated products, the Unified Catalog provides a shared framework where both technical and business users can work with trusted data.
