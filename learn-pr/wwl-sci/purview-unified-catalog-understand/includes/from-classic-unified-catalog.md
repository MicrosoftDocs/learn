The classic Microsoft Purview catalog was centered on the **Data Map**, which supported discovery, classification, and lineage tracking. It gave organizations visibility into where data resided and how it moved, but it provided limited business context and governance capabilities.

The **Unified Catalog** keeps the Data Map as its foundation and extends it with stronger governance, reporting, and collaboration features.

## Compare the classic and Unified Catalog experiences

While the classic catalog focused almost entirely on the Data Map, the Unified Catalog extends that foundation with governance, curated products, and collaboration.

The table compares the classic and Unified Catalog experiences.

| Classic catalog  | Unified Catalog |
|-----|-----|
| **Data Map** provided discovery, classification, and lineage | **Data Map** remains the foundation and adds governance concepts, curated products, and health reporting |
| **Metadata** focused mainly on technical details | **Metadata** enriched with business context |
| **Governance features** were limited | **Governance features** expanded with access controls, objectives, and reporting  |
| **Collaboration** designed mainly for technical users  | **Collaboration** extended to multiple personas: owners, stewards, business experts, and consumers |
| **Catalog** served as an inventory of assets | **Catalog** redefined as curated, governed data products |

## Limitations of the classic catalog

The classic catalog could scan sources and register assets, but it struggled to scale governance:

- Business context was limited, making it hard to connect assets to shared definitions.
- Governance options were basic, with few ways to apply consistent policies or track progress.
- Collaboration was narrow, often leaving business users without a clear way to engage.

## How the Unified Catalog expands the experience

The Unified Catalog closes these gaps by extending the Data Map with curated products, governance elements, and shared workspaces. AI-assisted curation reduces manual effort, and role alignment brings technical and business users together in one environment.

## Why the shift matters

The classic catalog was an inventory. The Unified Catalog turns that inventory into a governed framework where both technical and business roles can collaborate with confidence, knowing the data they use is consistent and trusted.

This shift is part of a bigger story about why unifying your entire data estate matters for the organization.
