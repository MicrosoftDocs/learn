The classic Microsoft Purview catalog was centered on the **Data Map**, which supported discovery, classification, and lineage tracking. It gave organizations visibility into where data resided and how it moved, but it didn't provide the business context or governance framework many organizations needed.

The **Unified Catalog** keeps the Data Map as its foundation and extends it with governance, health reporting, and collaboration features.

## Compare the classic and Unified Catalog experiences

| Classic catalog | Unified Catalog |
|-----|-----|
| **Data Map** provided discovery, classification, and lineage | **Data Map** remains the foundation and adds governance domains, glossary terms, policies, and health reporting |
| **Metadata** focused mainly on technical details | **Metadata** enriched with business context through glossary definitions, domains, and critical data elements |
| **Governance features** were limited | **Governance features** expanded with access policies, objectives and key results (OKRs), and health reports |
| **Collaboration** designed mainly for technical users | **Collaboration** extended to multiple personas: owners, stewards, business experts, and consumers |
| **Catalog** served as an inventory of assets | **Catalog** redefined as curated, governed data products |

## Limitations of the classic catalog

The classic catalog could scan sources and register assets, but it struggled to scale governance:

- Business context was limited, making it hard to connect assets to definitions or critical elements.
- Governance options were basic, with fewer ways to apply consistent access policies or tie activities to measurable goals.
- Collaboration was narrow, so business users often lacked a clear way to interpret or apply the information.

## How the Unified Catalog expands the experience

The Unified Catalog addresses these gaps by layering governance and collaboration on top of the Data Map:

- **Governance domains and glossary terms** provide shared business context.
- **Policies, OKRs, and health reports** apply consistent governance and highlight areas for improvement through data quality health reports and governance health reports.
- **Data products** package related assets into curated, governed sets.
- **AI-assisted curation (where available)** reduces manual work for stewards.
- **Role alignment** enables owners, stewards, experts, and consumers to collaborate in one environment with shared responsibilities.

## Why the shift matters

The classic catalog supported discovery and classification. The Unified Catalog builds on that foundation with business context, consistent governance, and curated products. This shift turns the catalog from an inventory of assets into a shared framework where both technical and business users can work with trusted data.
