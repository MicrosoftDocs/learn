Microsoft Purview Unified Catalog addresses fragmentation by giving organizations a single environment to organize, govern, and access data consistently.

To overcome these challenges, Unified Catalog provides capabilities that make data easier to manage, govern, and trust:

- **Centralizing data assets** with the [Microsoft Purview Data Map](/purview/data-map) which inventories sources across cloud and on-premises to provide a complete view of what exists and where it lives.

- **Adding business context** with glossary terms, governance domains, and critical data elements so definitions like _active customer_ are consistent across the organization.

- **Supporting self-service discovery** through curated data products that let analysts and developers find trusted data without searching across multiple systems.

- **Applying consistent governance** by enforcing policies for access, classification, and data quality across the estate.

- **Linking data to outcomes** with objectives and key results (OKRs) that tie activities to measurable business goals.

This unified approach reduces confusion, builds trust, and provides a reliable foundation for confident data use.
