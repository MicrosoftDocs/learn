Microsoft Purview Unified Catalog addresses fragmentation by giving organizations a single environment to organize, govern, and access data consistently.

To overcome these challenges, Unified Catalog provides capabilities that make data easier to manage, govern, and trust:

- **Centralizing data assets** with the [Microsoft Purview Data Map](/purview/data-map?azure-portal=true), which inventories sources across cloud and on-premises to provide a complete view of what exists and where it lives.
- **Adding business context** with governance concepts such as glossary terms and domains, so definitions like _active customer_ are consistent across the organization.
- **Supporting self-service discovery** with curated products that let analysts and developers find trusted information without piecing together raw sources.
- **Applying consistent governance** by enforcing access, classification, and quality controls across the estate.
- **Linking data to outcomes** with objectives that connect governance activities to measurable business goals.

This unified approach reduces confusion, builds trust, and provides a reliable foundation for confident data use.

To see how these capabilities fit together, the next step is to look at the core elements that make up the Unified Catalog.
