Microsoft Purview Unified Catalog provides the foundation for trusted data by combining technical assets, business context, and governance policies in one place. It addresses the challenges of fragmentation by making data easier to organize, govern, and access consistently across the organization.

Unified Catalog addresses fragmentation by:

- **Centralizing data assets**: The [Microsoft Purview Data Map](/purview/data-map) scans and inventories assets across cloud and on-premises sources. This inventory provides a complete view of what data exists and where it's located.

- **Adding business context**: Assets are enriched with glossary terms, governance domains, and critical data elements so that business users understand not just where data lives, but what it represents. For instance, a glossary term can standardize a definition like _active customer_ across the organization, reducing confusion and making reports more reliable.

- **Supporting self-service discovery**: Curated data products let analysts, developers, and other consumers find trusted data without needing to search across multiple systems.

- **Applying consistent governance**: Policies for access, classification, and data quality are applied uniformly, reducing risk and increasing trust in the data estate.

- **Linking data to outcomes**: Through objectives and key results (OKRs), organizations can tie governance activities to business goals, showing the value of unified data management.

By addressing fragmentation with a unified approach, Microsoft Purview Unified Catalog gives organizations a consistent foundation for trusted data and effective governance.
