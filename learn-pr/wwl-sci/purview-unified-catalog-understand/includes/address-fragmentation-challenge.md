A fragmented data estate can't be fixed by collecting more data. What's needed is a way to organize, govern, and make data accessible in a consistent manner across the organization. Microsoft Purview Unified Catalog provides this foundation by bringing technical assets, business context, and governance policies together in one place.

Unified Catalog addresses fragmentation by:

- **Centralizing data assets**: The [Microsoft Purview Data Map](/purview/data-map) scans and inventories assets across cloud and on-premises sources. This inventory provides a complete view of what data exists and where it's located.
- **Adding business context**: Assets are enriched with glossary terms, governance domains, and critical data elements so that business users understand not just where data lives, but what it represents.
- **Supporting self-service discovery**: Curated data products let analysts, developers, and other consumers find trusted data without needing to search across multiple systems.
- **Applying consistent governance**: Policies for access, classification, and data quality are applied uniformly, reducing risk and increasing trust in the data estate.
- **Linking data to outcomes**: Through objectives and key results (OKRs), organizations can tie governance activities to business goals, showing the value of unified data management.

For example, instead of each department maintaining its own definition of _active customer_, the Unified Catalog lets you attach a glossary term with a standard definition that applies everywhere the data appears. Reports and analytics built on that data now use a shared understanding, reducing confusion and speeding up decision-making.

By combining technical inventory with governance and business context, Microsoft Purview Unified Catalog turns a fragmented set of systems into a unified environment where data is discoverable, understandable, and trusted.
