Organizations rely on data to guide strategy, but fragmentation across systems, inconsistent definitions, and uneven governance make it difficult to treat data as a trusted asset. A sales team might track customer activity differently from finance, leading to reports that donâ€™t align and decisions that take longer because numbers must be reconciled.

Microsoft Purview Unified Catalog addresses this challenge by providing a single environment where technical metadata, business context, and governance controls come together. It inventories all data assets, organizes them into curated products, and applies consistent governance. Defined roles and responsibilities ensure that owners, stewards, experts, and consumers all contribute to trusted outcomes. AI features streamline discovery and curation, while governance oversight maintains accuracy and accountability.
