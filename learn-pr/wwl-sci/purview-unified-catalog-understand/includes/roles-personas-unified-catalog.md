Data governance works best when the right people are aligned to the right responsibilities. A unified catalog brings together technical data owners, business experts, and governance leaders into a shared environment. Each role contributes a different perspective that helps turn raw data into trusted business value.

## Core personas

Several personas typically interact with Microsoft Purview Unified Catalog. Their responsibilities overlap, but each plays a distinct part in governing data effectively:

- **Data owners**: Manage the systems and sources where data originates. They're responsible for granting access, ensuring system availability, and validating that data flows correctly into the catalog.
- **Data stewards**: Curate and enrich assets within the catalog. They assign glossary terms, identify critical data elements, and maintain data products so that business users can discover and use them with confidence.
- **Business experts**: Provide the context that turns technical metadata into business meaning. They validate glossary definitions, review domain structures, and ensure that assets reflect how the organization actually uses terms such as _customer_ or _transaction_.
- **Governance administrators**: Configure policies, domains, and reports that establish consistent rules across the catalog. They align access controls, review data quality reports, and connect governance goals to measurable business outcomes.
- **Data consumers**: Analysts, developers, and other end users who rely on curated data products. Their role is to use trusted data in day-to-day work, provide feedback on usability, and request new data products when gaps exist.

## Collaboration across roles

Consider how a data product takes shape in Unified Catalog. A sales analyst needs a trusted source for customer activity. The **data owner** connects the CRM system so records are inventoried. A **data steward** combines customer records and transactions into a curated product. A **business expert** validates glossary terms so the definition of _active customer_ is consistent. The **governance administrator** applies access policies to control who can use the data. Finally, the analyst, as a **data consumer**, can discover and work with the curated product directly.

This shared workspace reduces silos by letting each role contribute to a governed outcome:

- Owners ensure completeness and accuracy by connecting sources.
- Stewards and experts add business meaning and organize assets into domains.
- Governance administrators apply consistent policies and track progress against objectives.
- Consumers discover and use data products without needing to piece together raw assets from different systems.

By aligning these roles, organizations establish both accountability and trust. Data flows from technical sources into governed, business-ready products that meet compliance requirements and deliver value to end users.

## Importance of defined roles

Without defined roles, data governance efforts can stall. Assets might be inventoried but lack business meaning, or policies might be configured but never tied back to outcomes. The unified catalog provides not just a technical platform but also a framework for collaboration. When each persona understands their responsibilities, data governance becomes sustainable and scalable across the entire estate.

These defined personas and responsibilities set the stage for understanding how the unified catalog builds on the classic catalog experience and creates a more unified approach.
