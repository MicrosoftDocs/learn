Data governance works when the right people own the right responsibilities. The Unified Catalog brings data owners, business experts, and governance leaders into one environment where each role helps turn raw data into trusted business value.

## Core personas

Several personas typically interact with Microsoft Purview Unified Catalog. Their responsibilities overlap, but each plays a distinct part in governing data effectively:

- **Data owners**: Connect and manage source systems, grant access, ensure availability, and validate that data flows correctly into the catalog.

- **Data stewards**: Curate assets, assign glossary terms, identify critical data elements, and maintain data products so they’re discoverable and usable.

- **Business experts**: Validate definitions and domain structures, ensuring assets reflect real business usage for terms like _customer_ or _transaction_.

- **Governance administrators**: Configure policies, domains, and reports that establish consistent rules across the catalog. They align access controls, review data quality reports, and connect governance goals to measurable business outcomes.

- **Data consumers**: Analysts, developers, and others who use curated products, provide feedback, and request new products when gaps exist.

## Collaboration across roles

A sales analyst needs a trusted source for customer activity. Here’s how each role contributes:

- The **data owner** connects the CRM system so records are inventoried.

- A **data steward** combines records and transactions into a curated product.

- A **business expert** validates glossary terms so _active customer_ is consistent.

- The **governance administrator** applies access policies.

- The analyst, as a **data consumer**, uses the curated product directly.

This shared workspace ensures that each role contributes to a governed outcome the business can trust:

- Owners ensure completeness and accuracy by connecting sources.

- Stewards and experts add business meaning and organize assets into domains.

- Governance administrators apply consistent policies and track progress against objectives.

- Consumers discover and use data products without piecing together raw assets.

## Importance of defined roles

Without defined roles, governance efforts can lose momentum. Assets might be inventoried without business meaning, or policies might be configured without connection to outcomes. The Unified Catalog addresses this by combining a technical platform with a framework for collaboration, so each persona understands their responsibilities and contributes to trusted results.

When these responsibilities align with consistent definitions across departments, the organization moves from fragmented data to a unified estate. This foundation reduces confusion, builds trust, and enables confident decision-making. These outcomes bring the full value of unification into focus.
