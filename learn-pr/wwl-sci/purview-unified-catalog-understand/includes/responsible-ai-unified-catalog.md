Microsoft Purview Unified Catalog includes AI-powered features that make it easier to discover and organize data. These features can save time for governance teams and business users, but they also require careful oversight to ensure accuracy and responsible use.

## AI features in Unified Catalog

AI is integrated into the catalog experience in several ways:

- **Natural language search** lets users type queries in plain language to find data assets and products without knowing technical metadata.

- **AI-suggested mappings** propose links between assets and glossary terms to speed up curation.

- **AI-generated glossary terms** recommend new business terms based on patterns in the data estate.

These features make the catalog more approachable for business users and reduce manual effort for stewards.

## Why responsible use matters

AI can streamline cataloging, but suggestions might be incomplete or inaccurate if left unchecked. Without review, small gaps can scale into larger trust issues across the catalog.

Governance teams should:

- **Evaluate suggestions** to confirm they match business definitions.

- **Document decisions** so it's clear why a mapping or term was accepted or rejected.

- **Maintain oversight** by assigning review responsibilities to data stewards and domain owners.

Responsible use ensures that AI speeds up discovery and curation without reducing accountability or the accuracy of business definitions.

## Microsoft's responsible AI guidance

All AI-powered features in Unified Catalog follow [Microsoft's responsible AI principles](https://www.microsoft.com/ai/responsible-ai). These include transparency about when AI is used, safeguards against over-reliance, and clear options for users to accept or reject suggestions.

## Balancing efficiency and trust

AI features reduce manual work and speed up cataloging, but they donâ€™t replace governance. The most effective approach is to use AI as an assistant that accelerates curation, with governance ensuring trust.
