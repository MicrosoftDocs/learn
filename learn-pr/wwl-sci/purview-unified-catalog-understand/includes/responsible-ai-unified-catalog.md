Microsoft Purview Unified Catalog includes AI-powered features that make it easier to discover and organize data. These features can save time for governance teams and business users, but they also require careful oversight to ensure accuracy and responsible use.

## AI features in Unified Catalog

AI is integrated into the catalog experience in several ways:

- **Natural language search**: Lets users type queries in plain language to find data assets and products without needing technical metadata.
- **AI-suggested mappings**: Suggests links between assets and glossary terms to speed up curation.
- **AI-generated glossary terms**: Proposes new business terms based on patterns in the data estate.

These features make the catalog more approachable for business users and reduce manual effort for stewards.

## Why responsible use matters

AI features can reduce the manual effort of cataloging, but they still require oversight. A suggested glossary term might capture the right keyword but miss an important detail in its definition. Left unreviewed, these small gaps can scale into larger trust issues across the catalog.

Governance teams should:

- **Evaluate suggestions** to confirm they match business definitions and policies.
- **Document decisions** so it's clear why a mapping or term was accepted or rejected.
- **Maintain oversight** by assigning review responsibilities to data stewards and domain owners.

Responsible use ensures that AI speeds up discovery and curation without reducing accountability or the accuracy of business definitions.

## Microsoft's responsible AI guidance

All AI-powered features in Unified Catalog are designed with [Microsoft's responsible AI principles](/ai/responsible-ai) in mind. This includes transparency about when AI is used, safeguards against over-reliance, and clear ways for users to accept or reject suggestions. Governance roles are expected to use these features thoughtfully, balancing efficiency with accountability.

## Balancing efficiency and trust

AI features in Unified Catalog can reduce manual work and speed up cataloging, but they don't replace governance. Human oversight ensures that data definitions remain accurate and aligned with business needs. The most effective approach is to use AI as an assistant that accelerates discovery and curation, while relying on governance processes to maintain trust.
