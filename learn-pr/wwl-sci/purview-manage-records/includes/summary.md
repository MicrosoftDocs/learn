Without a structured records management process, your organization risks deleting important content prematurely or keeping sensitive data longer than necessary. In this module, you learned how Microsoft Purview helps reduce that risk by enabling controlled and auditable retention.

You learned to:

- Plan labeling strategies to support records management
- Organize and classify labels using the file plan
- Automatically apply labels to enforce governance at scale
- Declare items as records or regulatory records to meet compliance requirements
- Configure and manage disposition reviews to evaluate content before deletion

These tools give your organization a way to meet legal and regulatory obligations while maintaining operational oversight and control.
