What happens when your organization needs to prove that a contract wasn't altered after it was signed? Or when sensitive records must be kept for years but deleted once they're no longer needed? Basic retention settings alone aren't enough to manage this level of control.

Microsoft Purview supports advanced records management by letting you classify content with retention labels, declare records, automate labeling, and conduct disposition reviews before deletion. These capabilities help you enforce defensible data governance and meet legal or regulatory requirements.

In this module you'll learn how to:

- Plan retention and disposition strategies using labels
- Organize and manage labels with the file plan
- Automate label application using policy conditions
- Declare content as records or regulatory records
- Configure and manage disposition reviews
