## Use the report

The usage and insights report shows the list of applications with one or more sign-in attempts and allows you to sort by the number of successful sign-ins, failed sign-ins, and the success rate.

Selecting **load more** at the bottom of the list allows you to view more applications on the page. You can select the date range to view all applications that have been used within the range.

You can also set the focus on a specific application. Select **view sign-in activity** to see the sign-in activity over time for the application and the top errors.

When you select a day in the application usage graph, you get a detailed list of the sign-in activities for the application.
