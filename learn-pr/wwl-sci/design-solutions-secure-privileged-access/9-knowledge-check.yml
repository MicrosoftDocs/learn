quiz:
  questions:
  - content: "What is the Enterprise Access Model?"
    choices:
      - content: "A security architecture that organizes access control across control, management, and data/workload planes."
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "The Enterprise Access Model organizes access across three planes (control, management, and data/workload) and helps organizations apply Zero Trust principles to privileged access."
      - content: "A cloud service from Microsoft that provides identity and access management capabilities."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "The Enterprise Access Model is a security architecture concept, not a specific product or service from Microsoft."
      - content: "A way of organizing digital assets so that end-users can easily access and manage them."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "The Enterprise Access Model is about controlling and limiting privileged access to different planes, not making assets more accessible."
      - content: "A framework for extending IT capabilities by integrating different cloud services together."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "The Enterprise Access Model is a security architecture for privileged access control, not a cloud integration framework."
  - content: "Which Zero Trust principle is most directly supported by requiring just-in-time activation for privileged roles?"
    choices:
      - content: "Verify explicitly"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Verify explicitly relates to authentication and authorization based on all available data points, not time-limited access."
      - content: "Use least privilege access"
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "Just-in-time activation directly supports least privilege by ensuring users only have privileged access when needed and for limited durations."
      - content: "Assume breach"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Assume breach relates to minimizing blast radius and segmenting access, though JIT activation does help limit the window of opportunity for attackers."
      - content: "Defense in depth"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Defense in depth is a layered security strategy, not one of the three core Zero Trust principles."
  - content: "What attack technique involves extracting password hashes from memory and using them to authenticate without knowing the actual password?"
    choices:
      - content: "Kerberoasting"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Kerberoasting involves requesting service tickets and cracking them offline, not extracting password hashes from memory."
      - content: "Pass-the-hash"
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "Pass-the-hash attacks extract NTLM password hashes from memory and use them directly for authentication, bypassing the need for the plaintext password."
      - content: "Golden ticket"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Golden ticket attacks involve forging Kerberos tickets using the KRBTGT account hash, not extracting password hashes from memory."
      - content: "DCSync"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "DCSync involves replicating password hashes from domain controllers using replication protocols, not extracting them from memory on compromised systems."
  - content: "What is the recommended approach for administering AI workloads that access sensitive training data?"
    choices:
      - content: "Grant permanent access to AI administrators to ensure continuous model training"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Permanent access violates the least privilege principle. AI administrators should use time-limited, just-in-time access for training activities."
      - content: "Allow AI agents to self-elevate permissions when needed for training tasks"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "AI agents shouldn't have the ability to self-elevate permissions. Human oversight and approval workflows should govern permission changes."
      - content: "Use time-limited, just-in-time access with approval workflows for training activities"
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "AI model administration should follow the same privileged access principles as other sensitive activities, using JIT access and approval workflows to minimize risk."
      - content: "Exempt AI workloads from privileged access controls due to their autonomous nature"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "AI workloads should be subject to the same privileged access controls as other sensitive activities, not exempted from them."
