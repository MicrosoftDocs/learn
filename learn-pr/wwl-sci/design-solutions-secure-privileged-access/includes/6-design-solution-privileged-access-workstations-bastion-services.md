This unit looks at design considerations for privileged access workstations and bastion services.

## Privileged access workstations

The article provides an overview of security controls to provide a secure workstation for sensitive users throughout its lifecycle. 

![Diagram that shows a workflow to acquire and deploy a secure workstation.](../media/secure-workstation-deployment-flow.png)

This solution relies on core security capabilities in the Windows 10 operating system, Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, Microsoft Entra ID, and Microsoft Intune.

### Who benefits from a secure workstation?

All users and operators benefit from using a secure workstation. An attacker who compromises a PC or device can impersonate or steal credentials/tokens for all accounts that use it, undermining many or all other security assurances. If administrator or sensitive accounts are compromised, it allows attackers to escalate privileges and increase the access they have in your organization. Often, escalating dramatically to domain, global, or enterprise administrator privileges.

### Device Security Controls

The successful deployment of a secure workstation requires it to be part of an end to end approach including devices, accounts, intermediaries, and security policies applied to your application interfaces. All elements of the stack must be addressed for a complete privileged access security strategy.

This table summarizes the security controls for different device levels:

| Profile | Enterprise | Specialized | Privileged |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |:---: |
| Microsoft Endpoint Manager (MEM) managed | Yes | Yes | Yes | 
| Deny BYOD Device enrollment | No | Yes | Yes |
| MEM security baseline applied | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Microsoft Defender for Endpoint | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Join personal device via Autopilot | Yes | Yes | No |
| URLs restricted to approved list | Allow Most | Allow Most | Deny Default |
| Removal of admin rights |  | Yes | Yes |
| Application execution control (AppLocker)|  | Audit -> Enforced | Yes |
| Applications installed only by MEM | | Yes | Yes |

At all levels, Intune policies enforce good security maintenance hygiene for security updates. As the device security level increases, the attack surface is reduced while preserving as much user productivity as possible. Enterprise and specialized level devices allow productivity applications and general web browsing, but privileged access workstations don't. Enterprise users may install their own applications, but specialized users may not (and aren't local administrators of their workstations). 

#### Hardware root of trust

Essential to a secured workstation is a supply chain solution where you use a trusted workstation called the *root of trust*. Technology that must be considered in the selection of the root of trust hardware should include the following technologies included in modern laptops: 

* [Trusted Platform Module (TPM) 2.0](/windows-hardware/design/device-experiences/oem-tpm)
* [BitLocker Drive Encryption](/windows-hardware/design/device-experiences/oem-bitlocker)
* [UEFI Secure Boot](/windows-hardware/design/device-experiences/oem-secure-boot)
* [Drivers and Firmware Distributed through Windows Update](/windows-hardware/drivers/dashboard/understanding-windows-update-automatic-and-optional-rules-for-driver-distribution)
* [Virtualization and HVCI Enabled](/windows-hardware/design/device-experiences/oem-vbs)
* [Drivers and Apps HVCI-Ready](/windows-hardware/test/hlk/testref/driver-compatibility-with-device-guard)
* [Windows Hello](/windows-hardware/design/device-experiences/windows-hello-biometric-requirements)
* [DMA I/O Protection](/windows/security/information-protection/kernel-dma-protection-for-thunderbolt)
* [System Guard](/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-system-guard/system-guard-how-hardware-based-root-of-trust-helps-protect-windows)
* [Modern Standby](/windows-hardware/design/device-experiences/modern-standby)

For this solution, root of trust is deployed using [Windows Autopilot](/mem/autopilot/windows-autopilot) technology with hardware that meets the modern technical requirements. To secure a workstation, Autopilot lets you use Microsoft OEM-optimized Windows 10 devices. These devices come in a known good state from the manufacturer. Instead of reimaging a potentially insecure device, Autopilot can transform a Windows 10 device into a “business-ready” state. It applies settings and policies, installs apps, and changes the edition of Windows 10.

### Device roles and profiles

This guidance shows how to harden Windows 10 and reduce the risks associated with device or user compromise. To take advantage of the modern hardware technology and root of trust device, the solution uses [Device Health Attestation](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Intune-Customer-Success/Support-Tip-Using-Device-Health-Attestation-Settings-as-Part-of/ba-p/282643). This capability is present to ensure the attackers can't be persistent during the early boot of a device. It does so by using policy and technology to help manage security features and risks.

![Diagram that shows secure workstation profiles.](../media/secure-workstation-levels.png)

* **Enterprise Device** –  The first managed role is good for home users, small business users, general developers, and enterprises where organizations want to raise the minimum security bar. This profile permits users to run any applications and browse any website, but an anti-malware and endpoint detection and response (EDR) solution like [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint](/windows/security/threat-protection/) is required. A policy-based approach to increase the security posture is taken. It provides a secure means to work with customer data while also using productivity tools like email and web browsing. Audit policies and Intune allow you to monitor an Enterprise workstation for user behavior and profile usage. 

The enterprise security profile in the privileged access deployment guidance uses JSON files to configure the profile with Windows 10 and the provided JSON files.

* **Specialized Device** – This managed role represents a significant step-up from enterprise usage by removing the ability to self-administer the workstation and limiting which applications may run to only the applications installed by an authorized administrator (in the program files and preapproved applications in the user profile location. Removing the ability to install applications may affect productivity if implemented incorrectly. So, ensure that you have provided access to Microsoft store applications or corporate managed applications that can be rapidly installed to meet users needs.

  * The Specialized security user demands a more controlled environment while still being able to do activities such as email and web browsing in a simple-to-use experience. These users expect features such as cookies, favorites, and other shortcuts to work. But, they don't require the ability to modify or debug their device operating system, install drivers, or do similar tasks.

The specialized security profile in the privileged access deployment guidance uses JSON files to configure the profile with Windows 10 and the provided JSON files. 

* **Privileged Access Workstation (PAW)** – The highest security configuration designed for sensitive roles that would have a significant or material impact on the organization if their account was compromised. The PAW configuration includes security controls and policies that restrict local administrative access. It includes productivity tools that minimize the attack surface to only what is required for performing sensitive job tasks. 
This configuration makes the PAW device difficult for attackers to compromise because it blocks the most common vector for phishing attacks: email and web browsing. 
To provide productivity to these users, separate accounts and workstations must be provided for productivity applications and web browsing. While inconvenient, this control is necessary to protect users whose account could inflict damage to most or all resources in the organization.

  * A Privileged workstation provides a hardened workstation that has clear application control and application guard. The workstation uses credential guard, device guard, app guard, and exploit guard to protect the host from malicious behavior. All local disks are encrypted with BitLocker and web traffic is restricted to a limit set of permitted destinations (Deny all).

The privileged security profile in the privileged access deployment guidance uses JSON files to configure the profile with Windows 10 and the provided JSON files.

## Bastion services

Azure Bastion is a service you deploy that lets you connect to a virtual machine using your browser and the Azure portal. Or, you can connect via the native SSH or RDP client already installed on your local computer. The Azure Bastion service is a fully platform-managed PaaS service that you provision inside your virtual network. It provides secure and seamless RDP/SSH connectivity to your virtual machines directly from the Azure portal over TLS. When you connect via Azure Bastion, your virtual machines don't need a public IP address, agent, or special client software.

Bastion provides secure RDP and SSH connectivity to all of the VMs in the virtual network in which it's provisioned. Using Azure Bastion protects your virtual machines from exposing RDP/SSH ports to the outside world, while still providing secure access using RDP/SSH.

### Key benefits

|Benefit    |Description|
|-----------|-----------|
|RDP and SSH through the Azure portal|You can get to the RDP and SSH session directly in the Azure portal using a single-click seamless experience.|
|Remote Session over TLS and firewall traversal for RDP/SSH|Azure Bastion uses an HTML5 based web client that is automatically streamed to your local device. Your RDP/SSH session is over TLS on port 443. This configuration enables the traffic to traverse firewalls more securely. Bastion supports TLS 1.2 and above. Older TLS versions aren't supported.|
|No Public IP address required on the Azure VM| Azure Bastion opens the RDP/SSH connection to your Azure VM by using the private IP address on your VM. You don't need a public IP address on your virtual machine.|
|No hassle of managing Network Security Groups (NSGs)| You don't need to apply any NSGs to the Azure Bastion subnet. Because Azure Bastion connects to your virtual machines over private IP, you can configure your NSGs to allow RDP/SSH from Azure Bastion only. This configuration removes the hassle of managing NSGs each time you need to securely connect to your virtual machines. |
|No need to manage a separate bastion host on a VM |Azure Bastion is a fully managed platform PaaS service from Azure that is hardened internally to provide you secure RDP/SSH connectivity.|
|Protection against port scanning|Your VMs are protected against port scanning by rogue and malicious users because you don't need to expose the VMs to the internet.|
|Hardening in one place only|Azure Bastion sits at the perimeter of your virtual network, so you don’t need to worry about hardening each of the VMs in your virtual network.|
|Protection against zero-day exploits |The Azure platform protects against zero-day exploits by keeping the Azure Bastion hardened and always up to date for you.|

### Architecture

Azure Bastion is deployed to a virtual network and supports virtual network peering. Specifically, Azure Bastion manages RDP/SSH connectivity to VMs created in the local or peered virtual networks.

RDP and SSH are some of the fundamental means through which you can connect to your workloads running in Azure. Exposing RDP/SSH ports over the Internet isn't desired and is seen as a significant threat surface due to protocol vulnerabilities. To contain this threat surface, you can deploy bastion hosts (also known as jump-servers) at the public side of your perimeter network. Bastion host servers are designed and configured to withstand attacks. Bastion servers also provide RDP and SSH connectivity to the workloads sitting behind the bastion, and further inside the network.

Currently, by default, new Bastion deployments don't support zone redundancies. Previously deployed bastions may or may not be zone-redundant. The exceptions are Bastion deployments in Korea Central and Southeast Asia, which do support zone redundancies.

![Diagram showing the Azure Bastion architecture.](../media/bastion-architecture.png)

This figure shows the architecture of an Azure Bastion deployment. In this diagram:

* The Bastion host is deployed in the virtual network that contains the AzureBastionSubnet subnet that has a minimum /26 prefix.
* The user connects to the Azure portal using any HTML5 browser.
* The user selects the virtual machine to connect to.
* With a single click, the RDP/SSH session opens in the browser.
* No public IP is required on the Azure VM.
