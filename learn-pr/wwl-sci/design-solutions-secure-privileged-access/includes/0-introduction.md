Privileged accounts are the keys to your organization's most critical systems. Attackers who compromise these accounts can access sensitive data, modify security configurations, and establish persistent access that's difficult to detect. As a security architect, you need to design solutions that protect privileged access across your hybrid and multicloud environment.

## Scenario

Your organization is modernizing its security architecture to align with Zero Trust principles. The CISO has identified privileged access as a critical area requiring immediate attention after a security assessment revealed:

- Administrative accounts with standing privileges that are rarely used
- Inconsistent governance across cloud and on-premises identity systems
- Limited visibility into who has access to critical resources and why
- Legacy Active Directory configurations that haven't been updated in years

You've been asked to design a comprehensive privileged access security strategy that addresses these gaps while enabling administrators to perform their duties efficiently.

## What will you learn?

As a security architect, you need to design security solutions that protect privileged access using Zero Trust principles and Microsoft security frameworks.


In this module, you learn how to:

- Apply the Enterprise Access Model to design tiered privileged access strategies.
- Evaluate and design identity governance solutions that minimize standing privileges.
- Design secure access pathways for administrative tasks, including privileged workstations and remote access.
- Assess Active Directory Domain Services environments for resilience against common attacks.
