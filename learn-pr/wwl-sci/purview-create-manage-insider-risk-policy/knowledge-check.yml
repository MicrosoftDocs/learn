  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "A company wants to prevent employees from submitting sensitive information into generative AI tools. What should they do?"
    choices:
    - content: "Apply the Data theft by departing users policy."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect: This template focuses on data exfiltration related to resignations or terminations."
    - content: "Create a security policy violation template."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect: Security violations target unauthorized software, not AI data usage."
    - content: "Use the Risky AI usage policy template."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct: This template detects risky prompts and inputs in generative AI tools."

  - content: "A small business needs to quickly implement a policy to detect employees sharing sensitive files externally. They have limited resources and need a straightforward solution. What should they do?"
    choices:
    - content: "Create a custom policy to define detailed conditions and thresholds."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect: Custom policies require more time and configuration, which might not be suitable for organizations needing a quick setup."
    - content: "Use a quick policy template for data leaks."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct: Quick policies provide preconfigured settings, making them ideal for fast deployment and common scenarios like data leaks."
    - content: "Deploy a risky browser usage policy to monitor internet activity."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect: Risky browser usage policies focus on web activity, not file sharing, and wouldn't address the business's need."  

  - content: "A company wants to create a policy that prioritizes sensitive data labeled as 'Confidential' and assigns higher risk scores when files with this label are accessed. What step should they take during the policy creation process?"  
    choices:  
    - content: "Enable content prioritization when defining policy scope."  
      isCorrect: true  
      explanation: "Correct: Content prioritization allows organizations to assign higher risk scores to activities involving specific sensitivity labels, such as 'Confidential.'"  
    - content: "Add all employees to the policy scope without exclusions."  
      isCorrect: false  
      explanation: "Incorrect: Adding all employees doesn't address prioritizing sensitive data or assigning higher risk scores."  
    - content: "Use predefined thresholds for risk scoring."  
      isCorrect: false  
      explanation: "Incorrect: Predefined thresholds help set activity sensitivity but don't prioritize specific content types."  

  - content: "A security team wants to test a new policy before applying it broadly. What is the best approach?"
    choices:
    - content: "Deploy the policy to a small group first."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct: Testing with a smaller group allows the team to validate and refine the policy."
    - content: "Apply the policy organization-wide immediately."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect: Immediate deployment might lead to unexpected results without proper testing."
    - content: "Use only predefined thresholds."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect: Predefined thresholds might not address all organizational needs without testing."

  - content: "An organization implements policies but finds that alerts are too frequent, even for low-risk activities. What is the best course of action?"
    choices:
    - content: "Delete the policy and create a new one."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect: Deleting the policy may result in losing important configurations instead of refining them."
    - content: "Ignore the alerts and assume they're false positives."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect: Ignoring alerts could result in missing valid risks that require attention."
    - content: "Adjust thresholds and indicators in the policy settings."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct: Lowering sensitivity or adjusting conditions can reduce unnecessary alerts and improve accuracy."
