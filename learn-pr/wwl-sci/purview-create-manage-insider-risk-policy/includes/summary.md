Organizations face challenges in protecting sensitive data from insider risks, whether caused by accidental actions or intentional misuse. In this module, you took on the role of an information security administrator tasked with creating and managing policies to detect activities that might put data at risk. Your organization needed to protect intellectual property and other sensitive information while ensuring compliance and respecting privacy.

In this module, you learned how to:

- Identify and select the right policy templates to address specific insider risk scenarios
- Compare quick and custom policies to decide which approach best meets your organization's needs
- Create custom policies by defining scope, prioritizing content, and configuring triggers and indicators
- Manage policies effectively by reviewing alerts, refining settings, and maintaining policy health

Without Insider Risk Management policies, identifying risky activities would require manual processes, leaving organizations vulnerable to missed incidents or inconsistent enforcement. Creating policies manually could also be complex and error-prone, requiring significant resources to evaluate data and respond to potential risks.

By using Microsoft Purview Insider Risk Management, you streamlined the process of creating and managing policies to detect potential risks. Your organization can now protect sensitive data, reduce the likelihood of insider threats, and maintain employee trust by focusing on activities instead of individual monitoring. These policies provide a scalable and adaptable approach to managing insider risks, supporting compliance and security goals.
