Creating effective Insider Risk Management policies is just the first step. As insider risks evolve, so must your policies. Regular management ensures that policies stay relevant, effective, and aligned with your organization's goals. Proper management also helps you identify gaps, adjust thresholds, and refine settings to mitigate risks without creating unnecessary noise.

## Review policy health

Use the **Policy dashboard** in Microsoft Purview to view the health and effectiveness of your insider risk policies. The dashboard provides an at-a-glance view of critical metrics and insights:

- **Policy name**: Lists all active policies.
- **Policy status**: Indicates whether the policy is healthy or has configuration warnings or recommendations. For example:

  - _Healthy_: No issues are detected.

  - _Recommendations_: Configuration improvements are suggested to enhance the policyâ€™s effectiveness.

  - _Warnings_: Policy functionality might be impaired due to incomplete configurations or other issues.

- **Active alerts**: Displays the number of alerts currently generated by the policy.
- **Confirmed alerts**: Tracks the number of alerts validated as true positives over the last 365 days.
- **Actions taken on alerts**: Summarizes alerts that were confirmed or dismissed over the past year.
- **Policy alert effectiveness**: Shows the percentage of confirmed alerts divided by the total actions taken on alerts, providing a measure of the policy's success.

## Update policies

It's important to regularly review and update policies to ensure they remain effective. To update an existing policy:

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Purview portal](https://purview.microsoft.com/?azure-portal=true).
1. Navigate to **Solutions** > **Insider Risk Management** > **Policies**
1. Select the policy to update and select **Edit policy**.

1. Adjust the following settings as needed:

   - **Scope**: Modify the users, groups, or adaptive scopes included in the policy.

   - **Indicators and triggers**: Update activity thresholds or add new triggers.

   - **Priority content**: Revise content prioritization to align with changing organizational goals.

1. Save changes to apply the updates.

### Copy policies

If you need a new policy that's similar to an existing one, you can save time by copying and modifying an existing policy:

1. Select the checkbox for the policy you want to copy from the **Policies** dashboard.

1. Select **Copy policy**, then provide a unique name for the new policy.

1. Modify configurations as necessary, such as adjusting the scope, triggers, or indicators.

1. Submit the copied policy.

## Delete policies

When policies are no longer needed, you can delete them, but note that this action is irreversible. You have two options when deleting a policy:

1. **Delete only the policy**: Keeps associated alerts and user data.
1. **Delete the policy and associated data**: Removes all alerts and user data related to the policy unless the alerts are linked to an open case.

To delete a policy:

1. Navigate to the **Policies** dashboard.
1. Select the policy you want to delete.
1. Select **Delete**, then select the desired deletion option.
1. Select the appropriate deletion option.

   :::image type="content" source="../media/delete-insider-risk-policy.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the options for deleting an Insider Risk Management policy." lightbox=" ../media/delete-insider-risk-policy.png":::

1. Select **Yes, delete this policy** to confirm the removal of the Insider Risk Management policy.

> [!NOTE]
> Deleting a policy might take up to 72 hours to complete.

## Continuous improvement

Regular reviews and adjustments help ensure insider risk policies stay effective as organizational needs and risks change. These practices can help keep policies accurate and aligned with business goals:

- **Monitor policy effectiveness**: Use the Policy dashboard to track alert trends and refine policies based on results.
- **Adjust thresholds as needed**: Analyze alerts and feedback to reduce false positives and improve accuracy.
- **Document updates**: Maintain records of policy changes, including reasons for updates and outcomes, to support audits and compliance reviews.

By following these steps and recommendations, your organization can effectively create and manage Insider Risk Management policies to mitigate potential threats.
