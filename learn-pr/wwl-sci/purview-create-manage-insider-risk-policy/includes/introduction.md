Insider risks pose significant challenges for organizations, affecting sensitive data, reputation, and operations. Employees, contractors, and other trusted individuals with legitimate access might unintentionally or intentionally engage in activities that create risks. Managing these risks effectively requires well-designed policies that detect potential threats while maintaining employee trust.

Imagine you're responsible for protecting your organization's intellectual property. You want to create policies that detect risky behaviors, such as large file transfers by departing employees or unauthorized data sharing. At the same time, you need to ensure these policies respect privacy and adapt to changing organizational needs.

In this module, you:

- Understand the purpose and structure of policy templates
- Explore the differences between quick and custom policies and when to use each
- Implement quick policies for streamlined policy creation
- Create and configure custom policies to detect specific insider risk activities
- Manage policies to address evolving organizational needs

By the end of this module, you'll be able to create and manage policies that detect risky activities, address potential threats, and support a secure and trusted workplace.
