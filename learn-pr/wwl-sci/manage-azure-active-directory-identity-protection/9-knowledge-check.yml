    - content: "Reset a password for a user"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Only Global Administrators can reset user passwords. Security Operators can view all Identity Protection reports and the Overview screen, dismiss user risk, confirm safe sign-in, and confirm compromise."

    choices:
    - content: "Mobile device access risk policy"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. There's no directory policy for mobile device access risk."
    - content: "Sign-in risk policy"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Sign-in risk policy: The sign-in risk policy detects suspicious actions that come along with the sign-in. It's focused on the sign-in activity directly. Sign-in risk policy analyzes the probability that the sign-in wasn't performed by the user."
    - content: "Hybrid identity sign-in risk policy"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. There's no directory policy for hybrid identity."
  - content: "In Microsoft Graph, which three APIs expose information about risky users and sign-ins"
    choices:
    - content: "`riskDetection, riskyUsers, signIn`"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. There are three APIs that expose information about risky users and sign-ins. RiskDetection, allows you to query Microsoft Graph for a list of user and sign-in linked risk detections. You'll also get associated information about the detection. The second API, `riskyUsers`, allows you to query Microsoft Graph for information about users that Identity Protection detected as being risky. The API, `signIn`, allows you to query Microsoft Graph for information on Azure AD sign-ins. The information contains specific properties related to risk state, detail, and level."
    - content: "`riskDetection, itemActivity, signIn`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The `riskyUsers` and `signIn` APIs are correct. However, the `itemActivity` resource provides information about activities that took place on an item or within a container."
    - content: "`riskyUsers, signIn, IdentitySet`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The `riskyUsers` and `signIn` APIs are correct. However, `IdentitySet`, is a keyed collection of identity resources. It's used to represent a set of identities with various events such as created by or last modified by."
