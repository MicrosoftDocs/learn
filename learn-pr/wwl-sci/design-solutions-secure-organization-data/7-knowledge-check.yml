  questions:
    - content: What is the purpose of data encryption in Azure?
      choices:
        - content: To prevent unauthorized access to data in transit and at rest.
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: Data encryption in Azure is used to protect data from unauthorized access in transit and at rest.
        - content: To make it easier to access and process data.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Data encryption is not meant to make it easier to access or process data, but to protect it from unauthorized access.
        - content: To reduce the cost of storing data.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Data encryption does not reduce the cost of storing data, but it is essential to secure data against unauthorized access.
        - content: To improve the performance of applications that use data.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Data encryption does not improve the performance of applications that use data, but it can have a small impact on performance due to the additional overhead of encryption and decryption.
