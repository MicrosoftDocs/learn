  questions:
    - content: What is the purpose of data encryption in Azure?
      choices:
        - content: To prevent unauthorized access to data in transit and at rest.
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: Data encryption in Azure is used to protect data from unauthorized access in transit and at rest.
        - content: To make it easier to access and process data.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Data encryption is not meant to make it easier to access or process data, but to protect it from unauthorized access.
        - content: To reduce the cost of storing data.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Data encryption does not reduce the cost of storing data, but it is essential to secure data against unauthorized access.
        - content: To improve the performance of applications that use data.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Data encryption does not improve the performance of applications that use data, but it can have a small impact on performance due to the additional overhead of encryption and decryption.
    - content: What are the benefits of using Azure Key Vault for data encryption in Azure?
      choices:
        - content: It provides a centralized key management solution.
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: Azure Key Vault provides a centralized key management solution, allowing you to manage and protect your encryption keys.
        - content: It improves the performance of applications that use data encryption.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Azure Key Vault does not improve the performance of applications that use data encryption, but it can help ensure the security of encryption keys.
        - content: It reduces the cost of data encryption in Azure.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Azure Key Vault does not reduce the cost of data encryption in Azure, but it can help ensure the security of encryption keys.
        - content: It makes it easier to access and process encrypted data.

    - content: What is the main purpose of Microsoft Defender for Azure SQL?
      choices:
        - content: To provide database backups and disaster recovery
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: While database backups and disaster recovery are important features for any database management system, they are not the main purpose of Microsoft Defender for Azure SQL.
        - content: To secure the SQL Server engine from attacks and vulnerabilities
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: Microsoft Defender for Azure SQL is a cloud-based service that helps to protect SQL Server engines from attacks and vulnerabilities by providing real-time threat detection, alerts, and remediation recommendations.
        - content: To optimize SQL query performance
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: While query optimization is an important part of SQL Server performance tuning, it is not the main purpose of Microsoft Defender for Azure SQL.
        - content: To automate SQL Server maintenance tasks
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: While automation can help to streamline database management tasks, it is not the main purpose of Microsoft Defender for Azure SQL.
