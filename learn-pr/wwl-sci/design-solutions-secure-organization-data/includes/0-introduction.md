You're a cybersecurity architect for a financial services company that's expanding its Azure footprint. The organization stores sensitive customer data across multiple Azure services—Azure SQL databases for transactional data, Azure Storage for documents and backups, Azure Synapse Analytics for business intelligence, and Azure Cosmos DB for globally distributed applications.

Your CISO has asked you to design a comprehensive data security strategy that addresses regulatory requirements, protects against data breaches, and enables the security operations team to detect and respond to threats targeting sensitive data. You need to evaluate solutions for discovering and classifying data, implementing encryption, securing Azure data services, and enabling threat detection.

- Evaluate solutions for data discovery, classification, and threat prioritization
- Design solutions for data protection and encryption, including Azure Key Vault and infrastructure encryption
- Design security solutions for Azure data services, including Azure SQL, Azure Synapse Analytics, Azure Cosmos DB, and Azure Storage
- Design threat detection solutions using Microsoft Defender for Storage and Microsoft Defender for Databases

## Prerequisites

- Advanced experience and knowledge in identity and access, platform protection, security operations, securing data, and securing applications
- Experience with hybrid and cloud implementations
- Familiarity with Zero Trust security principles
