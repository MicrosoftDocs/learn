Microsoft Defender offers workload protections for multiple Azure workloads, such as:

- Azure Storage
- Azure SQL
- Azure Cosmos DB

## Defender for Storage

**Microsoft Defender for Storage** is an Azure-native layer of security intelligence that detects unusual and potentially harmful attempts to access or exploit your storage accounts. It uses advanced threat detection capabilities and [Microsoft Threat Intelligence](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2128684) data to provide contextual security alerts. Those alerts also include steps to mitigate the detected threats and prevent future attacks.

You can [enable Microsoft Defender for Storage](/azure/storage/common/azure-defender-storage-configure) at either the subscription level (recommended) or the resource level.

Defender for Storage continually analyzes the telemetry stream generated by the [Azure Blob Storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/storage/blobs/) and Azure Files services. When potentially malicious activities are detected, security alerts are generated. These alerts are displayed in Microsoft Defender for Cloud, together with the details of the suspicious activity along with the relevant investigation steps, remediation actions, and security recommendations.

Analyzed telemetry of Azure Blob Storage includes operation types such as `Get Blob`, `Put Blob`, `Get Container ACL`, `List Blobs`, and `Get Blob Properties`. Examples of analyzed Azure Files operation types include `Get File`, `Create File`, `List Files`, `Get File Properties`, and `Put Range`.

Defender for Storage doesn't access the Storage account data and has no impact on its performance.

### Security threats in cloud-based storage services

Microsoft security researchers have analyzed the attack surface of storage services. Storage accounts can be subject to data corruption, exposure of sensitive content, malicious content distribution, data exfiltration, unauthorized access, and more.

The potential security risks are described in the [threat matrix for cloud-based storage services](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/04/08/threat-matrix-for-storage/) and are based on the [MITRE ATT&CK® framework](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/enterprise/), a knowledge base for the tactics and techniques employed in cyber attacks.

### What kind of alerts does Microsoft Defender for Storage provide?

Security alerts are triggered for the following scenarios (typically from 1-2 hours after the event):

|Type of threat  | Description  |
|---------|---------|
|**Unusual access to an account**     | For example, access from a TOR exit node, suspicious IP addresses, unusual applications, unusual locations, and anonymous access without authentication.        |
|**Unusual behavior in an account**  | Behavior that deviates from a learned baseline, such as a change of access permissions in an account, unusual access inspection, unusual data exploration, unusual deletion of blobs/files, or unusual data extraction. |
|**Hash reputation based Malware detection**   | Detection of known malware based on full blob/file hash. This can help detect ransomware, viruses, spyware, and other malware uploaded to an account, prevent it from entering the organization, and spreading to more users and resources. See also [Limitations of hash reputation analysis](#limitations-of-hash-reputation-analysis). |
|**Unusual file uploads** | Unusual cloud service packages and executable files that have been uploaded to an account. |
| **Public visibility** | Potential break-in attempts by scanning containers and pulling potentially sensitive data from publicly accessible containers. | 
| **Phishing campaigns** | When content that's hosted on Azure Storage is identified as part of a phishing attack that's impacting Microsoft 365 users. |

### Limitations of hash reputation analysis

-   **Hash reputation isn't deep file inspection** - Microsoft Defender for Storage uses hash reputation analysis supported by [Microsoft Threat Intelligence](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2128684) to determine whether an uploaded file is suspicious. The threat protection tools don’t scan the uploaded files; rather they analyze the telemetry generated from the Blobs Storage and Files services. Defender for Storage then compares the hashes of newly uploaded files with hashes of known viruses, trojans, spyware, and ransomware.
    
-   **Hash reputation analysis isn't supported for all files protocols and operation types** - Some, but not all, of the telemetry logs contain the hash value of the related blob or file. In some cases, the telemetry doesn't contain a hash value. As a result, some operations can't be monitored for known malware uploads. Examples of such unsupported use cases include SMB file-shares and when a blob is created using [Put Block](/rest/api/storageservices/put-block) and [Put Block List](/rest/api/storageservices/put-block-list).

#### Discover and mitigate vulnerabilities

A vulnerability assessment service discovers, tracks, and helps you remediate potential database vulnerabilities. Assessment scans provide an overview of your SQL machines' security state, and details of any security findings. Defender for Azure SQL helps you identify and mitigate potential database vulnerabilities and detecting anomalous activities that could indicate threats to your databases.

#### Advanced threat protection

An advanced threat protection service continuously monitors your SQL servers for threats such as SQL injection, brute-force attacks, and privilege abuse. This service provides action-oriented security alerts in Microsoft Defender for Cloud with details of the suspicious activity, guidance on how to mitigate to the threats, and options for continuing your investigations with Microsoft Sentinel. Learn more about [advanced threat protection](/azure/azure-sql/database/threat-detection-overview).

Threat intelligence enriched security alerts are triggered when there's:

-   **Potential SQL injection attacks** - including vulnerabilities detected when applications generate a faulty SQL statement in the database
-   **Anomalous database access and query patterns** - for example, an abnormally high number of failed sign-in attempts with different credentials (a brute force attempt)
-   **Suspicious database activity** - for example, a legitimate user accessing an SQL Server from a breached computer which communicated with a crypto-mining C&C server

Alerts include details of the incident that triggered them, as well as recommendations on how to investigate and remediate threats. Learn more about the [security alerts for SQL servers](/azure/defender-for-cloud/alerts-reference#alerts-sql-db-and-warehouse).

## Defender for Azure Cosmos DB

Microsoft Defender for Azure Cosmos DB detects potential SQL injections, known bad actors based on Microsoft Threat Intelligence, suspicious access patterns, and potential exploitation of your database through compromised identities, or malicious insiders.

Defender for Azure Cosmos DB uses advanced threat detection capabilities, and [Microsoft Threat Intelligence](https://www.microsoft.com/insidetrack/microsoft-uses-threat-intelligence-to-protect-detect-and-respond-to-threats) data to provide contextual security alerts. Those alerts also include steps to mitigate the detected threats and prevent future attacks.

You can [enable protection for all your databases](/azure/defender-for-cloud/quickstart-enable-database-protections) (recommended), or [enable Microsoft Defender for Azure Cosmos DB](/azure/defender-for-cloud/quickstart-enable-database-protections) at either the subscription level, or the resource level.

Defender for Azure Cosmos DB continually analyzes the telemetry stream generated by the Azure Cosmos DB service. When potentially malicious activities are detected, security alerts are generated. These alerts are displayed in Defender for Cloud together with the details of the suspicious activity along with the relevant investigation steps, remediation actions, and security recommendations.

Defender for Azure Cosmos DB doesn't access the Azure Cosmos DB account data, and doesn't have any effect on its performance.

### What are the benefits of Microsoft Defender for Azure Cosmos DB

Microsoft Defender for Azure Cosmos DB uses advanced threat detection capabilities and Microsoft Threat Intelligence data. Defender for Azure Cosmos DB continuously monitors your Azure Cosmos DB accounts for threats such as SQL injection, compromised identities and data exfiltration.

This service provides action-oriented security alerts in Microsoft Defender for Cloud with details of the suspicious activity and guidance on how to mitigate the threats. You can use this information to quickly remediate security issues and improve the security of your Azure Cosmos DB accounts.

Alerts include details of the incident that triggered them, and recommendations on how to investigate and remediate threats. Alerts can be exported to Microsoft Sentinel or any other third-party SIEM or any other external tool. To learn how to stream alerts, see [Stream alerts to a SIEM, SOAR, or IT classic deployment model solution](/azure/defender-for-cloud/export-to-siem).

### Alert types

Threat intelligence security alerts are triggered for:

-   **Potential SQL injection attacks**:  
    Due to the structure and capabilities of Azure Cosmos DB queries, many known SQL injection attacks can’t work in Azure Cosmos DB. However, there are some variations of SQL injections that can succeed and may result in exfiltrating data from your Azure Cosmos DB accounts. Defender for Azure Cosmos DB detects both successful and failed attempts, and helps you harden your environment to prevent these threats.
    
-   **Anomalous database access patterns**:  
    For example, access from a TOR exit node, known suspicious IP addresses, unusual applications, and unusual locations.
    
-   **Suspicious database activity**:  
    For example, suspicious key-listing patterns that resemble known malicious lateral movement techniques and suspicious data extraction patterns.
