AI tools like Microsoft 365 Copilot and other generative services can introduce new risks when organizations lack visibility into how they're used or what data they access. Traditional tools often donâ€™t provide enough insight to assess these interactions effectively.

Microsoft Purview helps address this gap through Data Security Posture Management (DSPM) for AI and Microsoft Purview Audit. DSPM for AI surfaces activity involving sensitive content in AI tools, while Audit captures user and admin interactions with Microsoft 365 Copilot across supported apps.

In this module, you learned how to:

- Identify security risks in AI interactions
- Use Microsoft Purview to discover and analyze AI activity
- Review reports to evaluate compliance and data security posture

These tools help organizations understand how AI tools interact with data so they can take informed action to reduce risk.
