AI tools like Microsoft 365 Copilot, enterprise AI apps, and other generative services can expose sensitive data or lead to policy violations if left unmanaged. Traditional controls don't offer the visibility needed to assess how AI tools are used or what information they access.

Microsoft Purview provides capabilities that help address these gaps. Data Security Posture Management (DSPM) for AI identifies AI-related security risks and recommends policy actions. Microsoft Purview Audit captures activity logs for Microsoft 365 Copilot, making it easier to investigate usage across supported applications.

In this module, you learned how to:

- Identify security risks in AI interactions
- Use Microsoft Purview to discover and analyze AI activity
- Apply policies to protect sensitive data in AI-generated content
- Run data assessments to detect oversharing and labeling issues
- Review reports to evaluate compliance and data security posture

Together, these tools help organizations analyze AI activity and apply appropriate protections using consistent policies across Microsoft 365 and supported AI platforms.
