AI tools like Microsoft 365 Copilot, enterprise AI apps, and other generative services create new ways to work with data. They also introduce risks, particularly when organizations lack visibility into how these tools are used or what data is accessed.

Microsoft Purview provides capabilities that help security and compliance teams identify how AI tools interact with data and assess whether those interactions align with policy. This includes:

- **Data Security Posture Management (DSPM) for AI**, which surfaces potential data exposure risks and provides recommendations to strengthen security posture
- **Microsoft Purview Audit**, which records user and admin interactions with Microsoft 365 Copilot across supported applications

These tools support analysis of AI activity and help organizations take informed action to reduce risks related to sensitive data access, oversharing, and regulatory compliance.

## Learning objectives

- Identify security risks in AI interactions
- Discover AI activity using Microsoft Purview tools
- Evaluate reports and recommendations to assess compliance and security risks
- Run data assessments to detect oversharing and labeling issues
- Apply policies to protect sensitive data in AI-generated content
