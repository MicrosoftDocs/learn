AI tools like Microsoft 365 Copilot, enterprise AI apps, and other generative services are changing how people interact with data. These tools can improve productivity but also introduce risks when there's limited visibility into how they're used or what information they access.

Microsoft Purview helps organizations discover how AI tools interact with sensitive content. Using tools like **Microsoft Purview Data Security Posture Management (DSPM) for AI** and **Microsoft Purview Audit**, security teams can identify activity patterns, surface potential exposure risks, and review detailed logs of AI-related interactions.

These capabilities support early insight into AI usage, helping organizations understand risk before applying controls.

## Learning objectives

By the end of this module, you'll be able to:

- Identify security risks in AI interactions
- Discover AI activity using Microsoft Purview tools
- Apply policies to protect sensitive data in AI-generated content
