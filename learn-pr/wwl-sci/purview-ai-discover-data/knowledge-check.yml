    - content: "It blocks all AI activity by default to prevent security risks."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect: DSPM for AI doesn't block AI activity by default but provides monitoring and policy enforcement to reduce risks."
    - content: "It replaces traditional data loss prevention (DLP) policies with AI-specific rules."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect: DSPM for AI works alongside DLP policies but doesn't replace them."

  - content: "A security team wants to track non-Microsoft AI usage in the organization. What prerequisite should they configure?"
    choices:
    - content: "Enable Microsoft Defender for Endpoint."

    - content: "Sensitive interactions per AI app"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect: This report focuses on AI applications that process sensitive data, not overall AI usage trends."
    - content: "Top sensitivity labels referenced in Copilot"
      isCorrect: false
