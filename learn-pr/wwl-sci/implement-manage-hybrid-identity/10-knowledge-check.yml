  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "What is the defining feature of hybrid identity solutions?"
    choices:
    - content: "They create common user identities for authenticating and authorizing users who operate workstations that run on various operating systems."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Sorry, that's incorrect. Hybrid identity solutions don't recognize workstation operating systems."
    - content: "They create common user identities that are trusted for authentication and authorization between organizations."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Sorry, that's incorrect. Hybrid identity solutions don't create identities that are trusted between organizations."
    - content: "They create common user identities for authentication and authorization to both on-premises and cloud-based resources."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Authentication and authorization are essential for hybrid identity solutions."
  - content: "Which authentication method requires the least effort regarding deployment, maintenance, and infrastructure?"
    choices:
    - content: "Password hash synchronization (PHS)."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. PHS requires the least effort regarding deployment, maintenance, and infrastructure. Useful to organizations that only need their users to sign in to Microsoft 365, SaaS apps, and other Microsoft Entra based resources."
    - content: "Pass-through authentication (PTA)."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Sorry, that's incorrect. PTA calls for one or more lightweight agents installed on existing servers. These agents must have access to your on-premises Active Directory Domain Services, including your on-premises AD domain controllers. They also need outbound access to the Internet."
    - content: "Federated authentication."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The authentication system can provide advanced authentication requirements, such as smartcard-based authentication or third-party multifactor authentication."
  - content: "Some situations might require the removal of a server from being monitored by the Microsoft Entra Connect Health service. What needs to be done to start monitoring the same server again?"
    choices:
    - content: "The Microsoft Entra Connect Health service needs to be stopped and restarted on any other targeted server in the network."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Sorry, that's incorrect. Stopping and restarting the Microsoft Entra Connect Health service on another server won't allow you to start monitoring on the server you wish to start monitoring again."
    - content: "The Health Agent needs to be uninstalled and reinstalled on this server"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. To start monitoring a server again, the Health Agent needs to be uninstalled and reinstalled"
    - content: "The data already collected from this server needs to be deleted and then the Health Agent needs to be reactivated on the server."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Sorry, that's incorrect. Deleting the data already collected isn't necessary, and there's no way to reactivate the Health Agent without uninstalling and reinstalling it."
