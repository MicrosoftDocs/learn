  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "What is the defining feature of hybrid identity solutions?"
    choices:
    - content: "They create common user identities for authenticating and authorizing users who operate workstations that run on various operating systems."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Sorry, that's incorrect. Hybrid identity solutions don't recognize workstation operating systems."
    - content: "They create common user identities that are trusted for authentication and authorization between organizations."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Sorry, that's incorrect. Hybrid identity solutions don't create identities that are trusted between organizations."
    - content: "They create common user identities for authentication and authorization to both on-premises and cloud-based resources."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Authentication and authorization are essential for hybrid identity solutions."
  - content: "Which authentication method requires the least effort regarding deployment, maintenance, and infrastructure?"
    choices:
    - content: "Password hash synchronization (PHS)."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. PHS requires the least effort regarding deployment, maintenance, and infrastructure. Useful to organizations that only need their users to sign in to Microsoft 365, SaaS apps, and other Azure AD-based resources."
    - content: "Pass-through authentication (PTA)."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Sorry, that's incorrect. PTA calls for one or more lightweight agents installed on existing servers. These agents must have access to your on-premises Active Directory Domain Services, including your on-premises AD domain controllers. They also need outbound access to the Internet."
    - content: "Federated authentication."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The authentication system can provide advanced authentication requirements, such as smartcard-based authentication or third-party multifactor authentication."
  - content: "Some situations might require the removal of a server from being monitored by the Azure AD Connect Health service. What needs to be done to start monitoring the same server again?"
    choices:
    - content: "The Azure AD Connect Health service needs to be stopped and restarted on any other targeted server in the network."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Sorry, that's incorrect. Stopping and restarting the Azure AD Connect Health service on another server won't allow you to start monitoring on the server you wish to start monitoring again."
    - content: "The Health Agent needs to be uninstalled and reinstalled on this server"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. To start monitoring a server again, the Health Agent needs to be uninstalled and reinstalled"
    - content: "The data already collected from this server needs to be deleted and then the Health Agent needs to be reactivated on the server."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Sorry, that's incorrect. Deleting the data already collected isn't necessary, and there's no way to reactivate the Health Agent without uninstalling and reinstalling it."
