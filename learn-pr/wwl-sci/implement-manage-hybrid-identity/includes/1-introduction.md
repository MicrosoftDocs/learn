Hybrid identity allows corporations to have identity solutions that span on-premises and cloud-based solutions. This capability provides unified authentication and authorization capabilities to resources regardless of their location.

Organizations today are adding cloud application to their existing on-premises apps, which makes them hybrid companies. They need to have identity solutions that authenticate and authorize users to access applications and the underlying data in a secure way. An on-premises Active Directory solution is not enough; extending to the cloud with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) is necessary to provide a hybrid identity solution.

In this module, you will implement and manage a hybrid identity solution using Azure Active Directory and Azure AD Connect. You'll learn how to use the password hash synchronization (PHS) and pass-through authentication (PTA) to ensure you have the right authentication method for you needs. Then you will explore how single-sign-on (SSO) enables your users to access the apps they need while using secure access methods. Next, you will see how to connect to other existing external directories with Active Directory Federated Services (ADFS). Finally, you will learn how Azure AD Connect Health monitors the health of your identity solution and how to troubleshoot some common synchronization errors.

By the end of this module, you will be able to implement and manage a hybrid identity solution.
