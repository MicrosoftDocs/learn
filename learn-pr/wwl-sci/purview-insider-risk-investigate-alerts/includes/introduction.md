Identifying insider risks is only the beginning. Organizations also need a clear and consistent approach to investigating alerts and understanding the full context of user behavior. Without a structured process, high-risk activity might go unnoticed, low-risk alerts might receive too much attention, and investigators can struggle to determine the right response.

This module focuses on helping you analyze and respond to alerts in Microsoft Purview Insider Risk Management. You'll learn how to:

- Review and triage alerts using the Alerts dashboard
- Understand the factors that influence alert generation and risk scoring
- Use tools like Activity explorer, User activity, and All risk factors to investigate user behavior
- Work with insider risk cases to organize related alerts and take follow-up actions
- Extend your investigation into Microsoft Defender XDR and use advanced hunting for deeper insight

By the end of this module, you'll understand how to investigate insider risk alerts in a way that's efficient, accurate, and aligned with your organization's risk policies.
