The Alert dashboard in Microsoft Purview Insider Risk Management helps investigators and analysts view, prioritize, and take action on potentially risky user activity. Each alert is based on policy-defined conditions and provides a summary of the user's actions, associated risks, and relevant context. Effective alert triage ensures that high-risk behavior is addressed quickly, while low-risk activity can be dismissed to reduce noise.

## Overview of the Alert dashboard

The Alert dashboard provides a centralized view of all alerts generated by insider risk policies. Each alert is tied to a single user and includes:

- **Alert summary**: Displays the risk severity level, alert score, activity that triggered the alert, and triggering event.
- **User details and history**: Shows general user information and past alerts, including unresolved or repeated risk patterns.
- **Tabs for deeper analysis**: Includes tabs for **All risk factors**, **User activity**, and **Activity explorer** to review specific behavior in detail.

Alerts are automatically categorized by severity (low, medium, high) and can be filtered by status, policy, risk factor, or other criteria. Each new insight related to a user is added to their existing alert instead of generating a new one.

> [!NOTE]
> Only unrestricted administrators or users with proper role assignments can view alerts, depending on how administrative units are scoped.

## Filtering and customizing views

When working with a high volume of alerts, filtering and customizing your view can improve efficiency:

- **Add filters** to narrow results by attributes like risk factor, severity, policy, assigned analyst, or triggering event.
- **Save custom filter views** to quickly return to commonly used alert queues.
- **Customize columns** to show or hide fields like policy name, time detected, or alert status.
- **Search by keyword** such as user principal name (UPN), alert ID, or assigned admin.

These tools help reduce investigation time and support consistency across teams.

## Triage and take action on alerts

Once you've identified an alert that needs review, you can triage and take action directly from the Alert details page:

- **Dismiss** the alert if it was triggered by expected or non-risky behavior.
- **Confirm and create a case** to escalate the alert for deeper investigation.
- **Assign** the alert to another analyst or investigator.

Each alert is assigned a risk severity score based on multiple factors, including frequency of activity, user history, and the presence of risk indicators. If an alert remains untriaged and more risky behavior occurs, its severity level might increase.

> [!TIP]
> You can select and dismiss multiple low-priority alerts in bulk using the command bar. Up to 400 alerts can be dismissed at once.

## Use Security Copilot to accelerate triage

If enabled, Security Copilot embedded in Microsoft Purview can summarize an alert to help you triage faster. Without opening the alert, you can select **Summarize with Copilot** to generate an overview that includes:

- Policy name and triggering event
- Activity that generated the alert
- Key user attributes
- Top risk factors

Copilot can also suggest questions to help refine your summary, such as:

- What actions did the user perform in the last 10 days?
- List all sequential activities involving this user.
- Did the user engage in any unusual behavior?

These insights make it easier to prioritize the most important alerts and dismiss those that don't require follow-up.

## Retention and alert limits

Alerts in a "Needs review" state are retained for 120 days. After this period, they're automatically deleted unless linked to an active case. Active and unresolved cases are retained indefinitely. Organizations can have up to 100 active cases at any given time.

The Alert dashboard is the central hub for reviewing and triaging insider risk alerts in Microsoft Purview. It allows investigators to:

- Quickly assess risk severity and context
- Filter and organize large volumes of alerts
- Use Copilot to streamline triage
- Assign, dismiss, or escalate alerts as needed

By combining automated insights with manual review tools, the Alert dashboard supports efficient, accurate investigation workflows aligned with your organization's risk management goals.
