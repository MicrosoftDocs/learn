Investigating insider risk requires more than reviewing a single alert. It demands tools and workflows that provide insight into user behavior, risk indicators, and broader patterns of activity.

In this module, you learned how Microsoft Purview Insider Risk Management supports that process by:

- Providing the Alerts dashboard for structured triage and prioritization
- Offering context through the All risk factors tab, Activity explorer, and User activity views
- Enabling deeper review and coordinated response through cases
- Connecting alert data to Microsoft Defender XDR for broader investigation
- Supporting advanced queries with hunting tools for detailed behavioral analysis

Together, these tools help analysts and investigators move from initial detection to informed response. With this approach, organizations can respond more effectively to insider risks and reduce the time it takes to identify and act on meaningful threats.
