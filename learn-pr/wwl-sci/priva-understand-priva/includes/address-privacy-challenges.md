Managing privacy risks requires organizations to adopt proactive approaches to data protection. Microsoft Priva helps businesses reduce privacy risks, enforce compliance, and streamline data governance processes. Instead of focusing solely on compliance, organizations can integrate privacy practices into their operations, ensuring both protection and productivity.

## Key privacy challenges

Organizations face several challenges when managing personal data:

- **Identifying personal data:** Manually locating personal data across systems is time-consuming and prone to errors, making dynamic data insights difficult.
- **Managing data across boundaries:** Organizations operating globally struggle to enforce privacy policies across regions due to varying regulations.
- **Data minimization:** Excessive data collection leads to compliance risks and storage challenges, but controlling data retention manually is difficult.
- **Oversharing personal data:** Internal oversharing can result in unauthorized access, exposing organizations to breaches and legal issues.
- **Training and awareness gaps:** Traditional privacy training might be ineffective, leaving employees unaware of their role in maintaining data privacy.
- **Responding to privacy incidents:** Slow responses to data incidents increase the risk of noncompliance and reputational harm.

## How Microsoft Priva addresses these challenges

## Privacy in practice

A global retail company collects customer information, including contact details and order histories, to personalize services and streamline operations. As the business grows, data becomes scattered across teams and systems, leading to challenges with visibility, consistency, and compliance.

With Microsoft Priva, the company can automatically locate and classify personal data across regions. Policies can be implemented to restrict access based on job roles, enforce data minimization practices, and alert employees when data-sharing activities pose risks. Real-time notifications and guidance empower teams to make informed decisions, and automated workflows simplify responses to customer requests for data access or deletion.

By integrating Priva into their processes, the company reduces privacy risks, improves compliance, and builds customer trust without disrupting productivity.
