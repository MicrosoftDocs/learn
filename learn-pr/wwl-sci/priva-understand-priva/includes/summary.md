Managing personal data across departments and regions can create serious challenges. Without a clear approach, organizations face inconsistent processes, oversharing of sensitive information, and delays in responding to individual requests. These gaps increase compliance risks and reduce customer trust.

In this module, you learned how Microsoft Priva addresses these issues. Privacy Risk Management detects oversharing and provides guidance to employees, while Subject Rights Requests streamline how organizations collect and review data in response to customer requests. Together, these tools support a consistent and proactive approach to privacy management.

Without Priva, organizations would rely on manual searches and fragmented processes, often missing risks or failing to respond to requests on time. This leaves the business exposed to compliance failures and reputational damage. With Priva in place, privacy becomes part of everyday operations, protecting individualsâ€™ data while maintaining productivity and trust.
