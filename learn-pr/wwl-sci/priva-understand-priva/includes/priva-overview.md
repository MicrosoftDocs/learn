Microsoft Priva helps organizations simplify and automate privacy management. It protects personal data, reduces privacy risks, and supports compliance workflows with privacy regulations. The Priva suite focuses on two core tools: **Privacy Risk Management** and **Subject Rights Requests**.

## Why these tools matter

Managing personal data is often fragmented across teams and systems. Policies might exist, but they're applied inconsistently, and responding to individual rights requests can require significant manual effort. The result is a higher risk of noncompliance and reduced trust from customers.

Imagine a global company that stores customer records across multiple business units. Some teams overshare data internally, while others lack clear processes for responding when customers ask to see or delete their data. Priva provides a structured way to address both challenges without slowing down day-to-day operations.

## Privacy Risk Management

**Privacy Risk Management** gives organizations better visibility into how data is handled and where risks occur. Custom policies detect oversharing, overexposure, or other risky practices. Dashboards provide insights into patterns, and automated actions help remediate issues quickly. The goal is to reduce risk before it escalates into an incident.

## Subject rights requests

**Subject Rights Requests** streamline the process of handling requests to access, update, or delete personal data within Microsoft 365. Instead of relying on manual searches, Priva automates data collection, organizes results, and provides collaboration tools for review. This ensures requests are completed efficiently and consistently, reducing compliance gaps.

## Bringing it together

Together, these tools form the foundation of Microsoft Priva. Privacy Risk Management reduces the likelihood of incidents, while Subject Rights Requests ensure individuals' rights are respected. Both capabilities complement other Microsoft Purview solutions, such as sensitivity labels and data loss prevention, by focusing specifically on protecting personal privacy.
