Contoso Ltd., a global retail company, recently identified gaps in its privacy management processes. Employees frequently share customer data across regions without proper authorization. This practice increases the risk of data breaches and noncompliance with privacy regulations. The organization is considering implementing Microsoft Priva to address these issues.

Contoso plans to:

- Use Privacy Risk Management to detect and mitigate unauthorized data sharing.  
- Enable audit logs to track data activities.  
- Assign appropriate roles to ensure only authorized personnel can access privacy-sensitive tools.  
- Implement Subject Rights Requests to automate responses to individual access or deletion requests.
