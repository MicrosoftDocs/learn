The Microsoft Priva portal provides a centralized place to manage privacy solutions. It brings together the tools that help organizations reduce risks and respond to individual data requests. Priva is part of Microsoft Purview, and you can access it directly through the [Microsoft Priva portal](https://purview.microsoft.com/priva/?azure-portal=true) or from the [Microsoft Purview portal](https://purview.microsoft.com).

As a privacy administrator, you might sign in for the first time to review how your organization is handling subject rights requests. Before configuring policies or settings, it helps to understand how the portal is organized, including where to find solutions, how to reach related portals, and how to adjust preferences. Knowing the layout means you can focus on managing privacy tasks rather than searching for the right place to start.

## Exploring the Priva portal interface

The Priva portal is organized into sections that make it easy to find the tools and resources you need. From the homepage, you can jump directly into solutions, connect to related portals, or explore supporting materials. Each section is designed to reduce the time it takes to locate privacy features and help you focus on managing risks and responding to requests.

### Solution cards

On the portal homepage, solution cards offer quick access to available privacy tools. These cards show options like Privacy Risk Management and Subject Rights Requests. To explore everything available, select **View all solutions** to open the **All solutions** page. There, you can manage privacy features under the **Privacy** section and configure app experiences under the **Platform** section. Use predefined filters or the search bar for faster navigation.

These settings personalize the experience, while specific tools like Privacy Risk Management and Subject Rights Requests also include their own configurations.

## New navigation experience

The Priva portal uses a left-hand navigation pane that groups features and settings into logical sections. This design aligns with other Microsoft Purview tools, creating a consistent user experience.  

By familiarizing yourself with the portal's layout and features, you'll be better prepared to use Microsoft Priva effectively to manage privacy across your organization.
