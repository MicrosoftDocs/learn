Organizations handle large amounts of personal data, often scattered across regions and departments. Policies might be unevenly applied, and employees might not always know the right steps to take. These gaps increase the chance of oversharing information, delaying responses to data requests, or missing regulatory obligations.

Microsoft Priva helps close these gaps by providing tools that simplify privacy management. With automated risk detection, real-time guidance for employees, and structured workflows for subject rights requests, Priva enables organizations to protect privacy while keeping operations efficient.

## Scenario

Imagine you work for a global retailer that stores customer details and purchase histories. An internal review shows inconsistent handling of personal data across regions, and teams struggle to respond quickly when customers ask to access or delete their information. To solve this, your organization needs a privacy management solution that can both reduce risks and handle requests consistently.
