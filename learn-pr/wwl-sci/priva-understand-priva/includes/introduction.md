Organizations handle vast amounts of personal data, making privacy management increasingly complex. Microsoft Priva is a privacy management solution designed to help organizations identify, manage, and reduce privacy risks.  

Priva provides tools for identifying and categorizing personal data and analyzing risks related to data handling. It also enables responses to data subject rights requests, such as access, correction, or deletion. It also helps organizations establish automated workflows and policies to address privacy risks proactively.  

Microsoft Priva supports privacy risk management by providing insights and recommendations to help employees handle data responsibly. It promotes accountability while enabling organizations to meet privacy requirements without disrupting productivity.  

## Scenario

Imagine you work for a global retail company that collects and stores customer information, including contact details and purchase history. An internal review identified inconsistent handling of personal data across regions, and some teams lack clear processes for responding to customer requests to access or delete their information. Your organization needs a privacy management solution to address these gaps, streamline data handling practices, and ensure compliance with privacy requirements.  

You need a tool that can automatically identify and categorize personal data, enforce policies to reduce privacy risks, and respond efficiently to data subject requests.
