Searching across Microsoft 365 is a key step in any investigation involving sensitive content. Whether you're reviewing potential data leaks, responding to legal requests, or analyzing internal communications, Microsoft Purview eDiscovery provides a structured way to find the content that matters.

In this module, you learned how to:

- Assign the appropriate roles to access eDiscovery and view case data
- Create an eDiscovery case and run content searches across mail, files, and messages
- Use filters, conditions, and Copilot to narrow your search and improve accuracy
- Evaluate results using statistical summaries or random samples

Once you've validated your search results, you can choose to export the data or add it to a review set, depending on the needs of your case.

By using Microsoft Purview eDiscovery, you're able to investigate user activity across Microsoft 365 in a secure, auditable, and repeatable wayâ€”supporting your organization's security, compliance, and incident response efforts.
