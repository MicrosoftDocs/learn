AI tools are changing how people interact with information. By generating, summarizing, and analyzing content at scale, they improve productivity, but also increase the risk of exposing sensitive data. Traditional security controls often don't account for how AI tools access and process that data.

To address these risks, organizations need protections that apply consistently across AI interactions. Microsoft Purview offers several capabilities that support this need. Sensitivity labels can help control access to content used in Microsoft 365 Copilot. Endpoint data loss prevention (DLP) can restrict pasting and uploading into AI websites. Data Security Posture Management (DSPM) for AI recommendations guide the deployment of coordinated protections across multiple Microsoft Purview solutions.

## Learning objectives

By the end of this module, you'll understand how to:

- Use sensitivity labels to control how AI tools access and handle content
- Configure Endpoint DLP to restrict risky actions in browsers
- Apply DSPM for AI recommendations to protect sensitive data across Microsoft Purview solutions
