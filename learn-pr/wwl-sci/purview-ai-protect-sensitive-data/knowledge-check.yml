  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "How do sensitivity labels help protect content accessed by Copilot?"
    choices:
    - content: "By blocking users from opening labeled files in Microsoft 365 apps."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Sensitivity labels don't block users from opening files in Microsoft 365 apps unless specific access restrictions are configured."
    - content: "By enabling Copilot to follow data protection settings such as encryption and access control."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Sensitivity labels enforce protection settings that Copilot respects, such as encryption and user permissions."
    - content: "By requiring multi-factor authentication before users can view labeled content."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Sensitivity labels don't enforce multi-factor authentication directly. That control is managed through identity and access policies."

      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Assessments provide analysis but don't take destructive actions like deleting files."
    - content: "To identify sensitive data that AI tools might access and help enforce security controls."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Data assessments identify risk areas and inform decisions about applying protections."
