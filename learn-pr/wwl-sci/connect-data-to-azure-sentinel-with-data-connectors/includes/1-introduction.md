Data is ingested to the Microsoft Sentinel workspace by configuring data connectors. The data connectors are included in Content Hub solutions for Microsoft services and products, and third-party solutions.

## Microsoft Sentinel and Defender XDR

Use one of the following methods to integrate Microsoft Sentinel with Microsoft Defender XDR services:

- Ingest Microsoft Defender XDR service data into Microsoft Sentinel and view Microsoft Sentinel data in the Azure portal. Enable the Defender XDR connector in Microsoft Sentinel.

- Integrate Microsoft Sentinel and Defender XDR directly in the Microsoft Defender portal. In this case, view Microsoft Sentinel data directly with the rest of your Defender incidents, alerts, vulnerabilities, and other security data. To do this, you must onboard Microsoft Sentinel to the Defender portal.

## Scenario

You're a Security Operations Analyst working at a company that implemented Microsoft Sentinel. You need to learn how to connect log data from the many different data sources in your organization. The organization has data from Microsoft 365, Microsoft Defender XDR, Azure resources, non-azure virtual machines, and network appliances.

You plan on using the Microsoft Sentinel Content Hub solutions that include the data connectors to integrate the log data from the various sources. You need to document a connector plan for management that maps each of the organization's data sources to the proper Microsoft Sentinel data connector.

After completing this module, you'll be able to:

- Describe how to install Content Hub Solutions to provision Microsoft Sentinel Data connectors
- Explain the use of data connectors in Microsoft Sentinel
- Describe the Microsoft Sentinel data connector providers
- Explain the Common Event Format and Syslog connector differences in Microsoft Sentinel

## Prerequisites

Basic experience with Microsoft Azure or Microsoft Defender operations.
