quiz:
  questions: 
  - content: "Which of the following is a key risk associated with manual identity provisioning?"
    choices:
      - content: "Increased collaboration"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Collaboration isn't inherently a risk; the issue lies in lack of access control."
      - content: "Faster onboarding"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "While manual provisioning may be fast, it lacks governance and introduces risk."
      - content: "Stale or overprivileged accounts"
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "Manual provisioning often leads to outdated or excessive access rights, increasing security risk."

  - content: "What is the primary benefit of using Microsoft Entra Privileged Identity Management (PIM)?"
    choices:
      - content: "Enables just-in-time access and automated reviews"
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "PIM helps enforce least privilege by granting temporary access and automating access reviews."
      - content: "Provides persistent admin access"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Persistent access increases risk and contradicts Zero Trust principles."
      - content: "Encrypts sensitive data"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Encryption is handled by other tools like Microsoft Purview, not PIM."

  - content: "Why is uniform MFA enforcement problematic in hybrid environments?"
    choices:
      - content: "It increases password strength"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "MFA doesn't affect password strength; it adds a second layer of authentication."
      - content: "It causes user fatigue and frequent lockouts"
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "Without contextual triggers, MFA can frustrate users and reduce effectiveness."      
      - content: "It improves telemetry correlation"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Telemetry correlation is handled by monitoring tools, not MFA enforcement."

  - content: "Which Microsoft solution helps detect anomalous sign-ins and risky user behavior?"
    choices:
      - content: "Microsoft Defender for Identity"
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "Defender for Identity monitors identity signals and detects suspicious activity across hybrid environments."
      - content: "Microsoft Purview"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Purview focuses on data classification and protection, not identity threat detection."
      - content: "Microsoft Entra Lifecycle Workflows"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Lifecycle Workflows automate identity provisioning but don't detect threats."
