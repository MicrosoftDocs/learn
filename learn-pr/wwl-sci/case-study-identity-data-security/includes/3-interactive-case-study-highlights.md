This unit explores the key architectural and operational insights surfaced through the interactive case study on Woodgrove Bankâ€™s hybrid identity and data security posture. The simulation reveals systemic gaps that are common in enterprise environments and provides a structured lens for learners to analyze and reflect on them.

- **Identity Provisioning and Lifecycle Management**
  - Provisioning is manual and fragmented across business units, leading to stale, overprivileged accounts.
  - Lack of automation and lifecycle workflows results in inconsistent deprovisioning and privilege creep.
  - These gaps increase the risk of insider threats and unauthorized access.

- **Guest Access and External Collaboration**
  - Guest users are invited via self-service without expiration policies or role-based access controls.
  - This creates unmanaged external surfaces that persist beyond intended access periods.
  - Collaboration sprawl and lack of oversight amplify exposure to data leakage and misuse.

- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) Fatigue**
  - MFA is enforced uniformly without contextual triggers, causing user frustration and frequent lockouts.
  - The absence of adaptive policies undermines usability and security, especially for high-risk roles.
  - This friction can lead to resistance or circumvention, weakening the overall security posture.

- **Monitoring and Telemetry Fragmentation**
  - Security telemetry is siloed across identity systems, delaying detection of anomalous behavior.
  - Suspicious sign-ins, dormant account activity, and risky user behavior often go unnoticed.
  - Without centralized visibility, threat signals are missed or misinterpreted, reducing response effectiveness.

- **Data Governance and Classification Deficiencies**
  - Sensitive data is stored and shared in unclassified environments accessible to guests.
  - Manual labeling is inconsistent, and autolabeling isn't deployed, leading to misclassification.
  - Lack of policy enforcement allows data to flow unchecked, increasing the risk of exfiltration

- **Architectural Maturity Gaps**
  - Conditional Access policies are inconsistently applied.
  - Privileged access isn't time-bound or governed through approval workflows.
  - Legacy applications rely on weak authentication, and cloud adoption outpaces governance readiness.
