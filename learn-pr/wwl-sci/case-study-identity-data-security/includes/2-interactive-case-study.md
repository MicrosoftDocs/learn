In this unit, you engage with the interactive case study focused on Woodgrove Bank, a fictitious financial institution facing identity and data security challenges in a hybrid environment.

### Scenario Summary

Woodgrove Bank operates with a hybrid identity setup, facing fragmented provisioning, unmanaged guest access, and siloed monitoring. These issues highlight the need for integrated governance and real-time threat visibility.

### Interactive Case study structure

The structure of the interactive case study consists of the following five sections:

- **Animated Scenario**: Presents the context and challenges faced by a financial organization.
- **Hotspot Activity**: Allows you to uncover risks by exploring key areas in a visual environment.
- **Multiple-Choice Questions (MCQ)**: Challenges you to assess threats and identify vulnerabilities.
- **Drag-and-Drop Architecture Design**: Enables you to build a security solution using Microsoft technologies.
- **Carousel-Based Implementation Steps**: Visualizes how the solution would be deployed in a real-world setting.

Each component is designed to reinforce Zero Trust principles and promote architectural reasoning in hybrid identity environments.

### Access the Interactive Simulation
