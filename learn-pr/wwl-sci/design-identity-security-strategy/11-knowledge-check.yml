  title: "Design identity security strategy"
  questions:
  - content: "What can Tailwind Traders do to enforce strong authentication?"
    choices:
    - content: "Roll out Azure AD MFA for all users and block legacy authentication using conditional access policies."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct!"
    - content: "Use Azure AD MFA for only administrators."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Using MFA only for administrators would not allow you to enforce strong authentication across the entire organization."
    - content: "Use Application Proxy to restrict access to applications."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Using Application proxy would only help to secure applications, but would not affect authentication across the entire organization."
  - content: "How can Tailwind Traders reduce the risk of phishing and password attacks to secure their Azure environment?"
    choices:
    - content: "Enforce Azure AD to deploy FIDO 2.0 or password-less phone sign-in to reduce the risk of phishing and password attacks."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct!"
    - content: "Use ADFS to enforce authentication for legacy applications."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "ADFS provides single sign-on capabilities, but does not inherently reduce the risk of phishing and password attacks."
    - content: "Enable Azure AD Hybrid Join to block access from clients."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Azure AD Hybrid has limited authentication options and does not inherently reduce the risk of phishing and password attacks."
  - content: "What solution can Tailwind Traders use to monitor for user behavior inside SaaS and modern applications?"
    choices:
    - content: "Enable Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps integration with Identity Protection."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct!"
    - content: "Use Intune to monitor for abnormal behavior with applications."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Intune does not monitor for abnormal use of applications."
    - content: "Enforce Azure Active Directory B2C to implement secure white-label authentication."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Azure Active Directory B2C is an authentication solution. It does not handle monitoring of user behavior."
