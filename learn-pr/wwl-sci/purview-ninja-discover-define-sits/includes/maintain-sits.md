Maintaining up-to-date knowledge of all sensitive information types (both built-in and custom) is essential for safeguarding organizational data against emerging threats and regulatory changes. Regular reviews ensure that protection measures are effective and accurately reflect current business processes and requirements. Proactively updating and refining sensitive information definitions reduces the risk of data exposure and supports ongoing compliance efforts.

## Important steps to consider

- Regularly review and update sensitive information types. Schedule periodic reviews and monitor regulatory changes to keep both standard and custom types current. Update them as new threats or requirements arise, and inform relevant teams.

- Train employees on recognizing and handling sensitive information. Offer ongoing training, share clear guidelines, and provide quick-reference materials. Reinforce learning with assessments and recognize good practices.

- Adapt processes based on lessons learned from scans and incidents. Analyze incident reports to find gaps, update procedures as needed, and communicate changes. Monitor improvements and refine further if necessary.

By completing these steps, you've identified the sensitive information within your organization and are ready to move forward with safeguarding it.
