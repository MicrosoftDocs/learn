The selected content outlines a comprehensive approach to protecting sensitive data within organizations, especially during mergers and acquisitions. It introduces Microsoft Purview Data Loss Prevention (DLP) as a solution for identifying, classifying, and securing confidential information across platforms like email, Teams, SharePoint, and OneDrive. The process involves using both built-in and custom Sensitive Information Types (SITs), using advanced detection tools such as exact data match, fingerprinting, and trainable classifiers. The document emphasizes the importance of testing and refining policies to minimize false positives. It also highlights the need for regular reviews, employee training, and adaptation to regulatory or business changes to maintain ongoing policy effectiveness.

## Key takeaways

- Microsoft Purview DLP helps discover and protect sensitive data across multiple platforms by using built-in and customizable detection methods.

- Organizations should start by inventorying all data repositories, mapping data flows, and checking access permissions, including both legacy and newly acquired systems.

- Built-in SITs detect common sensitive data types (like credit card numbers, SSNs, health records) using industry-standard patterns, streamlining compliance and risk reduction.

- Custom SITs are necessary for organization-specific information (like internal codes or proprietary formulas). These are defined using patterns, keywords, regular expressions, exact data match, document fingerprinting, and trainable classifiers.

- Testing and iterating SITs is critical; definitions should be refined based on test results and stakeholder feedback to reduce false positives and missed detections.

- Continuous improvement is essential: regularly review and update SITs, train employees on data handling, and adapt processes based on lessons learned and new compliance requirements.

- Proper documentation and regular updates of policies are key for maintaining compliance and responding effectively to evolving security and regulatory needs.
