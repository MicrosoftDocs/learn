## Network configuration

If the organization doesn't require the endpoints to use a Proxy to access the Internet, the following configuration isn't required.

The Microsoft Defender for Endpoint sensor requires Microsoft Windows HTTP (WinHTTP) to report sensor data and communicate with the Microsoft Defender for Endpoint service. The embedded Microsoft Defender for Endpoint sensor runs in the system context using the LocalSystem account. The sensor uses Microsoft Windows HTTP Services (WinHTTP) to enable communication with the Microsoft Defender for Endpoint cloud service. The WinHTTP configuration setting is independent of the Windows Internet (WinINet) internet browsing proxy settings and can only discover a proxy server by using the following discovery methods:

Autodiscovery methods:

- Transparent proxy

- Web Proxy Autodiscovery Protocol (WPAD)

If a Transparent proxy or WPAD has been implemented in the network topology, there's no need for special configuration settings.
