## Configure Device discovery

When accessing your Microsoft Defender portal settings for Endpoints for the first time, the first step is to configure Device discovery. You must be a global administrator or security administrator for the tenant.

1. On the **Microsoft Defender XDR** portal, from the navigation menu, select **Settings** from the left.

1. In the Settings menu page, select Device discovery.

   > [!NOTE]
   > If you do not see the **Device discovery** option under **Settings**, logout by selecting the top-right circle with your account initials and select **Sign out**. Other options that you might want to try is to refresh the page with Ctrl+F5 or open the page InPrivate. Login again with the **Tenant Email** credentials.

1. In Discovery setup, make sure **Standard discovery (recommended)** is selected.

   > [!TIP]
   > If you do not see the option, refresh the page.

## Onboard devices


You need to go to the onboarding section of the Microsoft Defender portal to onboard any of the supported devices.  Depending on the device, you are guided with appropriate steps and provided management and deployment tool options suitable for the device.

In general, to onboard devices to the service:

- Verify that the device fulfills the minimum requirements

- Depending on the device, follow the configuration steps provided in the onboarding section of the Microsoft Defender portal

- Use the appropriate management tool and deployment method for your devices

- Run a detection test to verify that the devices are properly onboarded and reporting to the service
