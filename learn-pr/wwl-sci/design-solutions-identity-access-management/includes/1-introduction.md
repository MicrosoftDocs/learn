Identity is the foundation of security in cloud and hybrid environments. As a security architect, you design identity and access management solutions that verify users and workloads, control access to resources, and protect against identity-based attacks.

This module covers the key identity and access management decisions security architects face when designing secure environments. You learn how to design access strategies for different deployment models, enable secure collaboration with external identities, implement modern authentication, and protect both cloud and on-premises identity infrastructure.

## Scenario

Your organization is modernizing its identity infrastructure to support cloud adoption while maintaining security for existing on-premises systems. You need to design solutions that:

- Enable secure access to SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS resources
- Support collaboration with external partners and customers
- Implement adaptive authentication that responds to risk
- Protect Active Directory Domain Services from credential-based attacks
- Centrally manage secrets, keys, and certificates

As the security architect, you design the identity architecture that balances security requirements with user productivity while supporting Zero Trust principles.

## Learning objectives

By the end of this module, you're able to:

- Design access strategies for cloud, hybrid, and multicloud environments, including secure collaboration with external identities
- Design modern authentication and authorization strategies aligned with Zero Trust principles
- Design solutions for securing identity infrastructure, including Active Directory Domain Services and secrets management

## Prerequisites

- Advanced experience with identity and access concepts including authentication, authorization, and Active Directory
- Experience with Microsoft Entra ID, Conditional Access, and Azure Key Vault
- Conceptual knowledge of Zero Trust security principles
