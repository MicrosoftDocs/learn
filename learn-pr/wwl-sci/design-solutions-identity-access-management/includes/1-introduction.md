This module provides an in-depth exploration of designing identity and access management solutions in hybrid and multicloud environments. It covers various aspects such as user management, entitlement management, admin management, and credential management.

Imagine you're a cloud architect for a multinational corporation that is transitioning its infrastructure to Azure. You're tasked with designing a robust and secure identity and access management system. The challenge lies in managing identities across different departments, regions, and external partners while ensuring secure access to resources. This module guides you through the process of designing and implementing an effective identity and access management system in Azure.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you learn how to:

- Design cloud, hybrid, and multicloud access strategies
- Design a solution for Microsoft Entra ID
- Design a solution for external identities
- Design modern authentication and authorization strategies
- Specify requirements to secure Active Directory Domain Services
- Design a solution to manage secrets, keys, and certificates

The content in the module helps you prepare for the certification exam SC-100: Microsoft Cybersecurity Architect.

## Prerequisites

- Conceptual knowledge of security policies, requirements, Zero Trust architecture, and management of hybrid environments
- Working experience with Zero Trust strategies, applying security policies, and developing security requirements based on business goals

## Introduction

Identity provides the basis for a wide variety of security assurance. It grants access based on identity authentication and authorization controls in cloud services. Access control protects data and resources and helps decide which requests should be permitted.

The technological landscape in the enterprise is becoming complex and heterogenous. To manage compliance and security for this environment, identity and access management lets the right individuals access the right resources at the right time for the right reasons.

Identity and access management is boundary security in the public cloud. It must be treated as the foundation of any secure and fully compliant public cloud architecture. Azure offers a comprehensive set of services, tools, and reference architectures to help organizations make highly secure, operationally efficient environments.
