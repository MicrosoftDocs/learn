In this module, you learned how to design identity and access management solutions that protect organizational resources while enabling productivity. Security architects must balance strong security controls with usability to create identity solutions that organizations will actually adopt.

You learned how to:

- Design access strategies for cloud, hybrid, and multicloud environments, including secure collaboration with external identities
- Design modern authentication and authorization strategies aligned with Zero Trust principles
- Design solutions for securing identity infrastructure, including Active Directory Domain Services and secrets management

## Key takeaways

Identity security requires a comprehensive approach that addresses:

- **Cloud and on-premises integration** - Microsoft Entra Connect Sync enables hybrid scenarios while maintaining security boundaries
- **External collaboration** - B2B collaboration and CIAM require different tenant configurations and security controls
- **Adaptive access control** - Conditional Access evaluates multiple signals to enforce appropriate controls based on context and risk
- **Continuous verification** - CAE and Identity Protection enable real-time response to changing security conditions
- **Credential protection** - AD DS hardening and Key Vault work together to protect credentials throughout the environment
- **Zero Trust principles** - All identity solutions should verify explicitly, enforce least privilege, and assume breach
