  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: A security architect is designing identity infrastructure for an organization that has on-premises Active Directory and needs to enable single sign-on to Microsoft 365 and Azure resources. Which Microsoft Entra component should they implement?
    choices:
    - content: Microsoft Entra External ID
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Microsoft Entra External ID is for external identities such as B2B guests and customers, not for synchronizing internal employee accounts from on-premises Active Directory.
    - content: Microsoft Entra Domain Services
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Microsoft Entra Domain Services provides managed domain services in Azure but doesn't synchronize on-premises AD with Microsoft Entra ID.
    - content: Microsoft Entra Connect Sync
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Microsoft Entra Connect Sync synchronizes on-premises Active Directory identities to Microsoft Entra ID, enabling single sign-on to cloud resources while maintaining on-premises AD as the authoritative source.
  - content: An organization is building a consumer-facing mobile application and needs to provide branded sign-in experiences with self-service registration for millions of users. These users should not appear in the organization's workforce directory. Which Microsoft Entra External ID configuration should the security architect recommend?
    choices:
    - content: B2B collaboration in the workforce tenant
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: B2B collaboration adds guest users to your workforce directory alongside employees. It's designed for partner collaboration, not consumer-scale applications with millions of users.
    - content: External tenant with CIAM capabilities
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: An external tenant is configured specifically for consumer and business customer scenarios. It isolates customer identities from your workforce directory, supports custom branding, and scales to millions of users.
    - content: Cross-tenant access settings with automatic redemption
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Cross-tenant access settings control B2B collaboration between Microsoft Entra organizations, not consumer application scenarios requiring self-service registration and custom branding.
  - content: An organization wants to implement near real-time enforcement of access policy changes and immediate token revocation when user accounts are disabled. Which capability should the security architect recommend?
    choices:
    - content: Conditional Access with shorter token lifetimes
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Shorter token lifetimes provide faster enforcement but still leave a gap between policy changes and enforcement. Continuous Access Evaluation provides near real-time enforcement.
    - content: Continuous Access Evaluation (CAE)
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: CAE enables near real-time enforcement when critical events occur, such as account disablement, password changes, or risk elevation, without waiting for token expiration.
    - content: Microsoft Entra Identity Protection risk policies
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Identity Protection detects risky sign-ins and users but doesn't provide near real-time token revocation for critical events like account disablement.
  - content: A security architect is validating Conditional Access alignment with Zero Trust. Which of the following represents a violation of Zero Trust principles?
    choices:
    - content: MFA required only for users with administrative roles
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Zero Trust's "verify explicitly" principle requires verifying all users, not just administrators. MFA should be required for all users to properly implement Zero Trust.
    - content: Device compliance required for corporate resource access
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Requiring device compliance supports explicit verification by evaluating device state before granting access, which aligns with Zero Trust principles.
    - content: Risk-based policies that block access when user risk is elevated
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Risk-based policies support the "assume breach" principle by responding to detected threats, which aligns with Zero Trust.
  - content: Which Microsoft solution provides threat detection for on-premises Active Directory Domain Services, including detection of credential theft attacks like pass-the-hash and golden ticket attacks?
    choices:
    - content: Microsoft Defender for Cloud
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Microsoft Defender for Cloud focuses on cloud workload protection, not on-premises Active Directory threat detection.
    - content: Microsoft Entra Identity Protection
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Microsoft Entra Identity Protection detects risky sign-ins and users in Microsoft Entra ID, not on-premises Active Directory threats.
    - content: Microsoft Defender for Identity
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Microsoft Defender for Identity monitors on-premises Active Directory and detects credential theft attacks, lateral movement, and domain dominance attempts.
  - content: A security architect needs to store cryptographic keys for encrypting data in Azure Storage with customer-managed keys. The organization requires FIPS 140-2 Level 3 compliance and full control over the HSM. Which Azure Key Vault tier should they select?
    choices:
    - content: Standard tier with software-protected keys
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Standard tier uses software-protected keys and doesn't meet FIPS 140-2 Level 3 compliance requirements.
    - content: Premium tier with HSM-protected keys
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Premium tier provides HSM-protected keys with FIPS 140-2 Level 2 compliance, not Level 3.
    - content: Managed HSM
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Managed HSM provides single-tenant HSM with FIPS 140-2 Level 3 compliance and full customer control over HSM administration.
