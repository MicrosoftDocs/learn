          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Conditional Access applies controls based on specific conditions, including user, location, device, and application state. It restricts user access until they have met those conditions."
          
        - content: "An identity-based security model that enables customers to control access to applications and resources."
          isCorrect: true

        - content: "A type of user authentication specific to external identities."
          isCorrect: false

        - content: "A mechanism for enforcing Conditional Access policies in almost real-time."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Continuous Access Evaluation evaluates Conditional Access policies every time a request is made, allowing for swift and accurate responses to changes in the access control environment."
        
        - content: "A method for detecting rogue devices connecting to a network."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Continuous Access Evaluation assesses whether user requests meet the specified conditions set forth in Conditional Access policies, but it does not detect rogue devices connecting to a network."
