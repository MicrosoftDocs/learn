Organizations face various risks from within, ranging from accidental mistakes to malicious actions. Managing these risks effectively requires a thoughtful approach that protects data and compliance while respecting employee privacy. Microsoft Purview Insider Risk Management is designed to help organizations identify and respond to internal risks in a transparent and balanced way, focusing on actions rather than individual behaviors.

- **Policies**: Define the types of activities to evaluate, such as data exfiltration or security violations, using predefined templates.
- **Alerts**: Flag activities that meet policy conditions, prioritizing those that require attention.
- **Triage**: Evaluate alerts to determine if they indicate actual risks and decide on the next steps.
- **Investigate**: Examine cases with tools that provide insights into risk patterns and related activities.
- **Take action**: Resolve issues through notifications, policy adjustments, or escalating to legal or compliance teams.

This workflow emphasizes actions rather than individuals, ensuring responses remain fair and privacy-conscious.

## Addressing insider risks with policies

Policies in Microsoft Purview Insider Risk Management allow organizations to address specific types of risky activities. These policies act as guidelines, helping organizations identify and respond to scenarios that might pose a threat.

Common policy templates include:

- **Data theft by departing users**: Detects unusual file transfers or other suspicious activity as employees prepare to leave.
- **Data leaks**: Identifies when sensitive information is shared externally, whether by mistake or intentionally.
- **Security policy violations**: Flags actions like disabling security features or installing unauthorized software.
- **Patient data misuse (preview)**: Detects improper access to or sharing of patient records in healthcare settings.
- **Risky browser usage (preview)**: Highlights risky behavior like accessing unauthorized websites.

These policies provide a targeted and actionable approach, helping organizations focus on detecting and addressing specific risk scenarios without compromising user privacy.

## Use analytics for proactive risk management

Before creating policies, organizations can use **insider risk analytics** to evaluate potential risks. This feature helps identify areas with higher user risk and guides decisions about which policies to implement. Analytics provides valuable insights without requiring active policies, making it an excellent starting point for organizations new to insider risk management.

## Taking action with investigations and notifications

Once risks are identified, actions can be taken to mitigate them:

- **Investigations**: Cases allow for detailed analysis of risky activities, including reviewing associated data files, timelines, and user behavior patterns.
- **Notifications**: For less severe incidents, user notifications can serve as reminders or direct users to training resources to avoid future violations.
- **Escalations**: For serious risks, cases can be escalated to other tools like eDiscovery (Premium) for comprehensive legal and compliance reviews.
