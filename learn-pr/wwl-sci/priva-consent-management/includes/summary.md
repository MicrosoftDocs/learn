Managing user consent across digital platforms can be challenging, especially as organizations expand into new regions with different privacy expectations and regulations. Without a structured approach to tracking and honoring consent, organizations risk privacy compliance gaps, loss of user trust, and inefficiencies in managing consent across multiple systems.

Microsoft Priva Consent Management helps organizations address these challenges by providing a centralized, regulation-independent solution to manage consent preferences. With customizable consent models, publishing profiles, and integration with Microsoft Priva Tracker Scanning, organizations can streamline consent management, maintain compliance, and improve transparency in data collection practices.

Using consent models and publishing profiles, organizations can standardize consent tracking and deployment, ensuring users have clear visibility and control over how their data is collected and used. Automated deployment, tracker categories, and publishing profiles help apply consent models consistently across websites and services, making consent management more efficient and scalable.

In this module, you learned to:

- Describe the purpose and benefits of Microsoft Priva Consent Management.
- Set up consent models and configure prerequisites like tracker categories.
- Create and apply publishing profiles to manage consent models.
- Deploy consent models across websites using consent model packages.
- Ensure consent models remain accurate and aligned with privacy requirements.

Without a structured solution like Microsoft Priva Consent Management, organizations often rely on manual tracking methods that are time-consuming and prone to errors. Automating consent tracking, deployment, and enforcement helps organizations ensure compliance, build user trust, and manage consent more effectively.
