Digital interactions often involve sharing personal data, whether it’s creating accounts, making purchases, or signing up for services. While this data helps improve personalization and enhance user experiences, it can lead to privacy concerns if users don’t understand how their information is being collected, stored, or shared. For organizations, managing these concerns is essential to maintaining trust and ensuring transparency.

Microsoft Priva Consent Management (preview) helps organizations track and manage user consent preferences efficiently. By using this tool, organizations can align their practices with privacy regulations, honor user expectations, and promote responsible data practices.

## Scenario

Your organization is expanding digital services into new regions. Feedback shows users are confused about how their personal data is handled, and your team is struggling to centralize and manage consent preferences across platforms. Without a reliable system to track and honor consent, the organization risks losing user trust and failing to meet privacy standards.

You need a solution to simplify consent management, ensure compliance, and build transparency into your data practices.
