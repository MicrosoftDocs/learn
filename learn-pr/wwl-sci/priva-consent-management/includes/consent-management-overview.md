In today's digital age, most interactions with companies, websites, and apps involve the collection of personal data. This increase in data collection has made it essential for organizations to meet data privacy requirements and provide clear consent and notice around how personal data is collected and used.

Microsoft Priva Consent Management (preview) offers a flexible, regulation-independent solution to manage consented personal data. By providing customizable consent models and a centralized process for publishing at scale, this tool ensures that data collection aligns with consent preferences and responsible data practices.

## How it works

**Microsoft Priva Consent Management** allows you to create two types of consent models—tracker consent models and generic consent models—through a guided process. For tracker consent models, categories help organize and manage different types of consent, providing a structured way to align tracking practices with user preferences. Consent models can be reused across public domains and don’t need to be tied to specific websites. You can customize layouts to match your organization’s branding and include language translations to support visitors across multiple regions.

Once your consent models are ready, you can publish them globally using a centralized process. Deployment options include manually downloading packages, connecting to Azure Storage, or using content delivery networks (CDNs) such as Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services, and Cloudflare.

Consent Management integrates with [**Microsoft Priva Tracker Scanning (Preview)**](/privacy/priva/tracker-scanning?azure-portal=true) to use website scan results for enabling or disabling tracker categories. This integration ensures user preferences are respected in real time.

By streamlining consent management, Microsoft Priva helps organizations manage personal data effectively while meeting data privacy requirements. Next, learn how to set up consent models, configure tracker categories, and deploy them efficiently in your organization.
