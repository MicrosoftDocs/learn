The Microsoft Defender portal ([https://security.microsoft.com/](https://security.microsoft.com/?azure-portal=true)) is a specialized workspace designed to meet the needs of security teams. These solutions are integrated across Microsoft 365 services and provide actionable insights to help reduce risks and safeguard your digital estate.

You can investigate the alerts that affect your network, understand what they mean, and collate evidence associated with the incidents so that you can devise an effective remediation plan.

The Home page shows many of the common cards that security teams need. The composition of cards and data is dependent on the user's role. Because the Microsoft Defender portal uses role-based access control, different roles see cards that are more meaningful to their day-to-day jobs.

This at-a-glance information helps you keep up with the latest activities in your organization. The Microsoft Defender portal brings together signals from different sources to present a holistic view of your Microsoft 365 environment.

The Microsoft Defender portal combines protection, detection, investigation, and response to email, collaboration, identity, device, and app threats, in a central place.

This single pane of glass brings together functionality from existing Microsoft security portals, like the Microsoft Defender portal and the Office 365 Security & compliance portal. The Microsoft Defender portal emphasizes quick access to information, simpler layouts, and bringing related information together for easier use. It includes:

- **Microsoft Defender for Office 365** - Microsoft Defender for Office 365 helps organizations secure their enterprise with a set of prevention, detection, investigation and hunting features to protect email, and Office 365 resources.

- **Microsoft Defender for Endpoint** - delivers preventative protection, post-breach detection, automated investigation, and response for devices in your organization.
- **Microsoft Defender XDR** - is part of Microsoft’s Extended Detection and Response (XDR) solution that uses the Microsoft 365 security portfolio to automatically analyze threat data across domains, and build a picture of an attack on a single dashboard.
- **Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps** - is a comprehensive cross-SaaS and PaaS solution bringing deep visibility, strong data controls, and enhanced threat protection to your cloud apps.
- **Microsoft Defender for Identity** - is a cloud-based security solution that uses your on-premises Active Directory signals to identify, detect, and investigate advanced threats, compromised identities, and malicious insider actions directed at your organization.
- **Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management** - delivers continuous asset visibility, intelligent risk-based assessments, and built-in remediation tools to help your security and IT teams prioritize and address critical vulnerabilities and misconfigurations across your organization.



The **More resources** option in the portal provides a list of these related portals:

> [!NOTE]
> Microsoft Defender for Business is a licensing model designed especially for the small and medium-sized business (up to 300 employees). You might find Microsoft Defender portal content in the documentation section of Microsoft Defender for Business. The solutions use the same portal (https://security.microsoft.com) and therefore the documentation applies.
