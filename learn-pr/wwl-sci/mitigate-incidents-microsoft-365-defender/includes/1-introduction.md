Microsoft 365 Defender provides a purpose-driven user interface to manage and investigate security incidents and alerts across Microsoft 365 services.

You are a Security Operations Analyst working at a company that implemented Microsoft 365 Defender solutions, including Defender for Endpoint, Defender for Identity, Defender for Office 365, and Cloud App Security.  

You need to see related alerts across all the solutions as one incident to see the incident's full impact and do a root cause investigation.  The Microsoft Security center portal is a unified view of incidents and actions taken.
