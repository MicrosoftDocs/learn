The *Secure Score* is a holistic view of the *Microsoft Secure Score (365)*, which is a measurement of an organization's security posture, with a higher number indicating more recommended actions taken, and the *Cloud Secure score (Risk based)*, that is a representation of your organizations cloud security posture. They're part of the *Exposure Management* tools in the Microsoft Defender portal.

Following the Secure Score recommendations can protect your organization from threats. From a centralized dashboard in the Microsoft Defender portal, organizations can monitor and work on the security of their Microsoft 365 identities, apps, and devices.

Organizations gain access to robust visualizations of metrics and trends, integration with other Microsoft products, score comparison with similar organizations, and much more. The score can also reflect when third-party solutions have addressed recommended actions.
