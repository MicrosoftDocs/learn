    title: Check your knowledge
    questions:
    - content: "Your company is in the initial stages of planning data loss prevention (DLP) policies. You need to involve multiple departments to ensure comprehensive coverage. Which stakeholders should be included in this process?"
      choices:
      - content: "Only the IT department, since they're responsible for implementing and maintaining the DLP policies."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect: Relying only on IT might result in policies that don't cover legal and business needs."
      - content: "Only the security team, since they're responsible for protecting sensitive data."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Correct: The security team plays an important role, but other departments like legal and compliance also provide critical input to ensure data protection and compliance."
      - content: "IT, security, compliance officers, legal teams, and business unit leaders to make sure that all types of sensitive data and business needs are covered."
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "Correct: Involving stakeholders from multiple departments ensures that DLP policies cover a wide range of business needs, legal requirements, and data types."

    - content: "Your organization is preparing to deploy a new DLP policy to protect sensitive customer data. You want to ensure the policy doesn't disrupt workflows by generating false positives. What should your first step be before fully enforcing the policy?"
      choices:
      - content: "Run the policy in simulation mode to evaluate its effectiveness without blocking any actions."
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "Correct: Running the policy in simulation mode lets you see how it performs without affecting workflows, allowing you to adjust the policy if needed before full enforcement."
      - content: "Turn the policy on immediately to start blocking any sensitive data sharing."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect: Turning the policy on immediately without testing could disrupt workflows with false positives, causing unnecessary blocks."
      - content: "Only apply the policy to a few key services and enforce it right away."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect: Applying the policy to only a few services without simulation could still lead to unintended blocks and false positives."

    - content: "Your company is using a DLP policy created from a  preconfigured template, but you notice it's generating too many false positives for internal communications. What should you do next?"
      choices:
      - content: "Delete the policy and create a new custom policy from scratch."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect: Deleting the policy and starting from scratch isn't necessary. Adjusting the policy conditions would be more efficient."
      - content: "Turn off the policy to prevent any further disruptions to internal workflows."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect: Turning off the policy removes important protections, which could lead to sensitive data being exposed."
      - content: "Modify the policy to exclude internal domains from being flagged for sensitive data sharing."
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "Correct: Excluding internal domains allows the DLP policy to focus on external sharing of sensitive data while avoiding unnecessary flags for internal communications."

    - content: "Your company is setting up a DLP policy with Adaptive Protection for Microsoft Teams and Exchange. Users with 'Minor Risk' levels need some oversight but shouldn't face harsh restrictions. How should you configure the policy?"
      choices:
      - content: "Apply the same DLP rules for 'Minor Risk' users as for 'Elevated Risk' users, to be safe."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect: Treating 'Minor Risk' users the same as 'Elevated Risk' users wouldn't reflect their lower risk level and would impose too many restrictions."
      - content: "Allow sharing of sensitive data but audit all activities for 'Minor Risk' users."
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "Correct: For 'Minor Risk' users, allowing sensitive data sharing while auditing their activities provides oversight without being overly restrictive."
      - content: "Block all sensitive data sharing for 'Minor Risk' users to ensure safety."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect: Blocking all sensitive data sharing for minor risk users is unnecessary and too restrictive, which could disrupt their work."

    - content: "Your organization has been using the DLP Alerts dashboard to monitor policy violations. You need more detailed insights into how data is being shared, including specific actions like copying or printing sensitive data. What tool would be more appropriate for this task?"
      choices:
      - content: "Use Activity Explorer to track detailed user actions and review how sensitive data is being handled across the organization."
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "Correct: Activity Explorer provides more granular details on user actions, such as copying or printing sensitive data, giving you deeper insights than the DLP Alerts Dashboard."
      - content: "Rely only on DLP Alerts dashboard to manage all activities involving sensitive data."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect: While the DLP Alerts dashboard tracks policy violations, it doesn't provide the detailed activity logs that Activity Explorer does."
      - content: "Turn off DLP alerts to reduce the number of notifications and focus only on major incidents."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect: Turning off DLP alerts removes your ability to track violations and might cause you to miss critical incidents involving sensitive data."
