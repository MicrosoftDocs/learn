Data loss prevention (DLP) is most effective when it's planned with intent. Many organizations struggle with DLP not because the technology is limited, but because policies are designed or enforced without fully understanding how data moves, how people work, and where risk actually occurs.

Sensitive data flows constantly across email, collaboration tools, endpoints, browsers, and AI experiences. Most data loss is accidental, happening during everyday work rather than through malicious intent. Protecting that data requires more than knowing where it lives. It requires understanding what the data is, how it's used, and which actions create risk.

Effective DLP starts with clarity. That means understanding how DLP evaluates data, where protection can be applied, and how enforcement decisions affect legitimate work. It also means validating policy behavior before introducing restrictions and recognizing when added complexity does or doesn't improve outcomes.

By the end of this module, you'll be able to:

- Explain how DLP evaluates content, context, and user actions
- Identify where DLP can apply protection and how enforcement differs by location
- Plan DLP policies based on risk, scope, and impact
- Use simulation mode to validate policy behavior before enforcement
- Recognize when advanced DLP controls can improve enforcement decisions
