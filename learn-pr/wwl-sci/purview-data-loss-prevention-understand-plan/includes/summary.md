Planning and deploying data loss prevention (DLP) effectively requires more than enabling policies. It requires understanding how DLP evaluates data, where protection can be applied, and how enforcement decisions affect everyday work.

In this module, you learned how to:

- Explain how DLP evaluates content, context, and user actions
- Identify where DLP applies protection and why enforcement differs by location
- Plan DLP policies based on risk, scope, and business context
- Use simulation mode to validate policy behavior before enforcement
- Recognize when advanced DLP controls can improve enforcement decisions

Without this foundation, DLP policies can create noise, disrupt productivity, or fail to address meaningful risk. Applying a deliberate planning and rollout approach in Microsoft Purview helps ensure protections are accurate, explainable, and aligned with how work actually happens.
