  questions:
    - content: "What is Conditional Access in Azure AD?"
      choices:
        - content: "A feature that allows users to bypass security policies."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Conditional Access applies controls based on specific conditions, including user, location, device, and application state. It restricts user access until they have met those conditions."
          
        - content: "An identity-based security model that enables customers to control access to applications and resources."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Conditional Access grants or denies application access to users by requiring multifactor authentication or blocking access when the specified conditions are not met."
          
        - content: "A type of user authentication specific to external identities."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Conditional Access is not a type of user authentication but a set of access controls designed to improve security."

        - content: "An automated tool for managing user privileges within an organization."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Conditional Access defines user-specific access policies but does not manage user privileges."
    - content: "What is External Identities in Azure AD?"
      choices:
        - content: "A set of tools for managing conditional access policies for partners and customers."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "External Identity tools are designed to support B2B scenarios to simplify the management of policies related to guests, partners, and vendors accessing shared resources."
        
        - content: "A system for managing user accounts within an organization."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "External Identities offers the ability to create and manage identities for users outside an organization in order to provide partner and customer access to assigned resources."
        
        - content: "A set of tools for managing user accounts and access for non-employees or guests that need to access organizational assets."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "External identities enable secure collaboration between external users like customers, business partners, or vendors and internal teams while guarding against unauthorized data access."
        
        - content: "An automatic threat detection system that detects abnormal behavior patterns in user accounts."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "External Identities provides capabilities around governance, user access, authentication, and identity protection, but does not include an automatic threat detection system."
    - content: What is Privileged Access Management (PAM)?
      choices:
        - content: A tool used to simplify user provisioning
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: PAM isn't an identity and access management tool but rather it's focused on reducing the risk of privilege misuse within an organization.
        - content: An account management tool designed for non-admin users
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: PAM is a security feature that minimizes the attack surface against privileged accounts and focuses on preventing privilege misuse.
        - content: A control layer for managing access to high-risk services and applications
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: PAM is designed to help minimize organizational risk by providing a control layer that ensures access to high-risk services is granted based on specific criteria such as business justification or time-bound provisioning.
        - content: A baseline security feature that is enabled by default
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: PAM is an optional feature and must be explicitly enabled in Microsoft Azure-based subscriptions.
