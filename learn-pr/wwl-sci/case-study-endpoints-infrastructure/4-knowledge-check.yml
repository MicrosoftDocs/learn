quiz:
  questions: 
   - content: "What is a common risk associated with decentralized endpoint management in hybrid enterprise environments?"
     choices:
        - content: "It creates exploitable entry points due to inconsistent security practices."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: Inconsistent patching and tooling create vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit.
        - content: "It ensures consistent patching across all devices."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Decentralized management often leads to inconsistent patching and delayed remediation.
        - content: "It simplifies compliance enforcement across regions."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Compliance enforcement becomes more difficult without centralized control.

   - content: "Which Microsoft solution provides agentless, protocol-aware monitoring for operational technology (OT) environments?"
     choices:
      - content: "Defender for IoT"
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: Defender for IoT is designed for agentless monitoring of OT and IoT systems.
      - content: "Microsoft Intune"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: Intune is used for endpoint management, not OT monitoring.
      - content: "Azure Arc"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: Azure Arc extends governance to hybrid infrastructure but does not monitor OT networks.

   - content: "What is the primary benefit of using IoT Hub with Private Endpoints in a hybrid security architecture?"
     choices:
       - content: "It enables secure, scalable cloud integration without public exposure."
         isCorrect: true
         explanation: Private Endpoints ensure secure telemetry routing and cloud integration.
       - content: "It allows telemetry to be sent over the public internet."
         isCorrect: false
         explanation: Private Endpoints are used to avoid public internet exposure.
       - content: "It eliminates the need for edge processing."
         isCorrect: false
         explanation: Edge processing remains important for local telemetry handling.

   - content: "Which of the following is a common deployment blocker when implementing security tools across distributed environments?"
     choices:
       - content: "Conflicting change management practices across operational teams"
         isCorrect: true
         explanation: Security rollouts often conflict with strict operational change windows.
       - content: "Lack of Microsoft licensing"
         isCorrect: false
