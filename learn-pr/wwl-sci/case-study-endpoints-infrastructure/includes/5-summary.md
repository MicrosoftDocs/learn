Now that you completed the case study, compare the decisions made in the simulation to practices within your own organization. Consider how endpoint compliance, infrastructure visibility, and threat detection can be improved across IT, OT, and cloud environments.

In this case study module, you:

- Explored common security gaps in distributed, hybrid enterprises spanning endpoints, OT/IoT, and cloud governance.
- Learned how to analyze threats and map Microsoft security capabilities to address risks across IT and industrial environments.
- Applied architectural reasoning to design and sequence a Zero Trust–aligned solution that secures endpoints and infrastructure end‑to‑end.
