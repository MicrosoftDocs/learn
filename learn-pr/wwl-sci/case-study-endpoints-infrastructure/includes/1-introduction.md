This module introduces you to a real-world scenario focused on securing endpoints and infrastructure in a hybrid enterprise environment. Based on Litware's environment, a fictitious global manufacturing company, the case study highlights common security challenges faced by organizations operating across on-premises and cloud environments, including device management, threat detection, and infrastructure protection

Through this case study, you analyze business requirements, match technical capabilities to meet those needs, and design secure, cohesive solutions that address the security challenges and business requirements.

In this case study module, you:

- Explore common security gaps in distributed, hybrid enterprises spanning endpoints, OT/IoT, and cloud governance.
- Learn how to analyze threats and map Microsoft security capabilities to address risks across IT and industrial environments.
- Apply architectural reasoning to design and sequence a Zero Trust–aligned solution that secures endpoints and infrastructure end‑to‑end.
