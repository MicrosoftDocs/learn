This unit explores the architectural and operational insights surfaced through the interactive case study on Litware Inc.’s hybrid endpoint and infrastructure security posture. The simulation reveals systemic gaps common in distributed industrial environments and provides a structured lens for learners to analyze and reflect on them.

### Situation Assessment

Litware Inc. faces several endpoint and infrastructure security challenges across its global operations:

- Decentralized endpoint management leads to inconsistent patching and delayed remediation.
- OT/IoT systems operate on flat networks with default credentials and legacy protocols, prioritizing uptime over security.
- Regional cloud deployments lack centralized governance, creating visibility and configuration gaps.
- Security telemetry is processed locally using disparate SIEM tools, limiting enterprise-wide threat correlation.
- Public internet is used for telemetry flow, exposing sensitive data and reducing control.

These issues reflect architectural maturity gaps and fragmented governance that elevate the risk of multi-vector attacks across IT, OT, and cloud domains.

### Threat Analysis

Operational weaknesses translate into tangible threats:

- Malware entry via unmanaged endpoints and inconsistent patching.
- Lateral movement through OT/IoT systems with default credentials and flat network architecture.
- Exploitation of misconfigured cloud resources due to decentralized provisioning.
- Third-party access risks from unmanaged contractor devices.
- Blind spots in threat detection due to siloed telemetry and skill disparities across regions.
- Exposure of telemetry and operational data via public internet paths.

These vulnerabilities highlight how fragmented infrastructure and inconsistent security practices can be exploited, especially in hybrid industrial environments.

### Architectural Solution

A Zero Trust–aligned hybrid security framework using integrated Microsoft tools addresses Litware Inc.’s risks:

- Microsoft Intune and Defender for Endpoint for unified endpoint management and compliance enforcement.
- Defender for IoT for agentless, protocol-aware monitoring of OT environments.
- Azure Arc and Defender for Cloud for extending governance and threat protection to hybrid infrastructure.
- IoT Hub, IoT Edge, and Private Endpoints for secure telemetry routing and cloud integration.
- Microsoft Sentinel and Defender XDR for centralized threat correlation and response across IT, OT, and cloud.

This architecture emphasizes:

- Unified visibility and governance
- Secure edge integration
- Cross-domain threat correlation
- Operational continuity in industrial environments

It directly addresses unmanaged endpoints, OT vulnerabilities, decentralized cloud governance, and telemetry blind spots.
