In Microsoft Sentinel, you can search across long time periods in large datasets by using a search job. You also have the option to restore archived logs to include in the search job. 

You're a Security Operations Analyst working at a company that implemented Microsoft Sentinel. You discover a new indicator of Compromise (IoC) and need to investigate if it has been previously seen in the logs. You need to restore archive logs and run a search job to discover previous instances of the IoC.

After completing this module, you'll be able to:

- Use Search Jobs in Microsoft Sentinel
- Restore archive logs in Microsoft Sentinel

## Prerequisites

Basic knowledge of operational concepts such as Kusto Query Language (KQL), logging, and archiving

> [!IMPORTANT]
> [Microsoft Sentinel is generally available in the Microsoft Defender portal](https://security.microsoft.com), including for customers without Microsoft Defender XDR or an E5 license.
>
> Starting in **July 2026**, all customers using Microsoft Sentinel in the Azure portal will be redirected to the Defender portal and will use Microsoft Sentinel in the Defender portal only. Starting in **July 2025**, many new customers are automatically onboarded and redirected to the Defender portal.
>
> If you're still using Microsoft Sentinel in the Azure portal, we recommend that you start planning your transition to the Defender portal to ensure a smooth transition and take full advantage of the unified security operations experience offered by Microsoft Defender.
