The Microsoft 365 security center is the new home for monitoring and managing security across your Microsoft identities, data, devices, apps, and infrastructure. Here you can easily view the security health of your organization, act to configure devices, users, and apps, and get alerts for suspicious activity. The Microsoft 365 security center helps security admins and security operations teams manage and protect their organization.

The Microsoft 365 security center home page shows many of the common cards that security teams need. The composition of cards and data is dependent on the user role. Because the Microsoft 365 security center uses role-based access control, different roles will see cards that are more meaningful to their day to day jobs.

The Microsoft 365 security center allows your admins to tailor the navigation pane to meet their day-to-day operational needs. Admins can customize the navigation pane to show or hide functions and services based on their specific preferences. Customization is specific to the individual admin, so other admins won’t see your changes. The Microsoft 365 security center navigation pane comprises these options:

- **Home:** Get at-a-glance view of the overall security health of your organization.
- **Incidents:** See the broader story of an attack by connecting the dots seen on individual alerts on entities. You'll know exactly where an attack started, what devices are impacted, who was affected, and where the threat has gone.
- **Alerts:** Have greater visibility into all the alerts across your Microsoft 365 environment. Includes alerts from Microsoft Cloud App Security, Microsoft Defender for Office 365, Azure Active Directory, Microsoft Defender for Identity, and Microsoft Defender for Endpoint. Available to E3 and E5 customers.
- **Action center:** Reduce the volume of alerts your security team must address manually, allowing your security operations team to focus on more sophisticated threats and other high-value initiatives.
- **Reports:** Get the detail and information you need to better protect your users, devices, apps, and more.
- **Secure score:** Improve your overall security posture with Microsoft Secure Score. This page provides an all up summary of the different security features and capabilities you've enabled and includes recommendations for areas to improve.
- **Advanced hunting:** Proactively search for malware, suspicious files, and activities in your Microsoft 365 organization.
- **Classification:** Help protect data loss by adding labels to classify documents, email messages, documents, sites, and more. When a label is applied (automatically or by the user), the content or site is protected based on the settings you choose. For example, you can create labels that encrypt files, add content marking, and control user access to specific sites.
- **Policies:** Set up policies to manage devices, protect against threats, and receive alerts about various activities in your org.
- **Permissions:** Manage who in your organization has access to view content and perform tasks in the Microsoft 365 security center. You can also assign Microsoft 365 permissions in the Azure AD Portal.

> [!NOTE]
> You must be assigned an appropriate role, such as Global Administrator, Security Administrator, Security Operator, or Security Reader in Azure Active Directory to access the Microsoft 365 security center.

The new Microsoft 365 security center is a specialized workspace designed to meet the needs of security and compliance teams. The Microsoft 365 security center provides actionable insights to help reduce risks and safeguard your digital estate.
