Incidents are a collection of correlated alerts created when a suspicious event is found. Alerts are generated from different device, user, and mailbox entities, and can come from many different domains. These alerts are automatically aggregated by Microsoft 365 Defender. It's the grouping of these related alerts that form an incident. The incident provides a comprehensive view and context of an attack.

Security personnel can use an incident to determine where an attack started, what methods were used, and to what extent the attack has progressed within the network. They can also determine the scope of the attack, and how many users, devices, and mailboxes were affected. The severity of the attack can also be determined.

## Incident management

Managing incidents is critical in ensuring that threats are contained and addressed.  In Microsoft 365 Defender, you can manage incidents on devices, users accounts, and mailboxes.

You can manage incidents by selecting one from the Incidents queue.

Incidents are automatically assigned a name based on an alert. You can edit the name of an incident, resolve it, then set its classification and determination. You can also assign the incident to yourself, and add incident tags and comments.

When you investigate cases where you want to move alerts from one incident to another, you can also do so from the Alerts tab. You'll create a larger or smaller incident that includes all relevant alerts.
