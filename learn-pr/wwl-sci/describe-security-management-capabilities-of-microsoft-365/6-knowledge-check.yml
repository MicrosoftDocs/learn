  - content: "Admins in the organization are using the Microsoft 365 security center every day. They want to quickly get an understanding of the organization's current security posture. Which section in the Microsoft 365 security center will they use?"
    choices:
    - content: "Reports."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Reports will provide targeted information but doesn't give a snapshot of an organization's security posture."
    - content: "Secure Score."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Secure Score, in the M365 security center, will give a snapshot of an organization’s security posture, and provide details on how to improve it."
    - content: "Policies."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. A snapshot of an organization's current security posture can't be found in the Policies option."
  - content: "Which of the following describes what an admin would need to select to view security cards grouped by risk, detection trends, configuration, and health, among others?"
    choices:
    - content: "Group by topic."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Use this filter to view security cards grouped by risk, detection trends, configuration, and health, among others."
    - content: "Group by risk."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This isn't the filter to get the correct view."
    - content: "Group by category."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This isn't the filter to get the correct view."
  - content: "An admin wants to get a comprehensive view of an attack including where it started, what tactics were used, and how far it has gone in the network. What can the admin use to view this type of information?"
    choices:
    - content: "Alerts"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Although alerts provide valuable clues about an ongoing attack, piecing them together to get a comprehensive view is challenging.  An incident is a collection of correlated alerts that make up the story of an attack."
    - content: "Reports"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Reports provide status and trends for the compliance of your Microsoft 365 devices, data, identities, apps, and infrastructure."
    - content: "Incidents"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. An incident is a collection of correlated alerts that make up the story of an attack."
