    choices:
    - content: "Reports."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Reports will provide you with targeted information but doesn't provide a snap-shot of your organization's security posture."
    - content: "Secure score."
      isCorrect: true

    - content: "Policies."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. You will not be able to find a snap-shot of your current security posture from the Policies option."
  - content: "Which of the following describes what an admin would need to select to view security cards grouped by risk, detection trends, configuration and health, and other?"
    choices:
    - content: "Group by topic."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. You'd use this filter to view security cards grouped by risk, detection trends, configuration and health, amongst others."
    - content: "Group by risk."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This is not the correct filter to get the right view."
    - content: "Group by category."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This is not the correct filter to get the right view."
  - content: "An admin wants to get a comprehensive view of an attack, including where the attack started, what tactics were used, and how far the attack has gone in the network. What can the admin use to view this type of information?"
    choices:
    - content: "Alerts"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Although alerts provide valuable clues about an on-going attack, piecing them together to get a comprehensive view is challenging.  An Incident is a collection of correlated alerts that make up the story of an attack."

      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. An incident is a collection of correlated alerts that make up the story of an attack."
