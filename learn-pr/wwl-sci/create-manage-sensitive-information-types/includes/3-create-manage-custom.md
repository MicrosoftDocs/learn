A common usage scenario for a custom sensitive information type is to protect stored employee IDs, cost center numbers, and other human resources and finance department-specific data against accidental loss. Since most organizations use individual patterns for this information, they can't use a default built-on sensitive information type.  

Instead, they need to create a custom sensitive information type to use at a later stage of implementation in a data loss prevention policy, a sensitivity label, or for a retention policy or label.

The best way to create a new custom sensitive information type is to search for an existing built-in sensitive information type that functions like your needs, export, and modify the rule and upload it with a new name. For detailed instructions to create and edit custom sensitive information types see [Create a custom sensitive information type](/microsoft-365/compliance/create-a-custom-sensitive-information-type?view=o365-worldwide?azure-portal=true).

> [!TIP]
> Regular Expressions are a powerful tool. Creating search patterns is a recurring task. For more information see the resources available at the end of this module for more details on using regular expressions.
