EDM-based classification enables you to create custom sensitive information types that refer to exact values in a database of sensitive information. The database can be refreshed daily and contain up to 100 million rows of data. So as employees, patients, or clients come and go, and records change, your custom sensitive information types remain current and applicable.

Creating a new custom sensitive information type with EDM-based classification involves the following steps performed in order:

1. Set up EDM-based classification

1. Hash and upload the sensitive data

1. Use EDM-based classification with your Microsoft cloud services.
