Microsoft Security Copilot provides a range of agents designed to enhance security workflows and streamline operations. These agents assist security engineers by automating tasks, providing insights, and integrating with other Microsoft security tools.

### Define agents in Microsoft Security Copilot

Agents in Microsoft Security Copilot help automate repetitive tasks, reduce manual workloads, and optimize security operations. Agents consist of predefined workflows and capabilities tailored to address particular security challenges. They're designed to perform specific tasks, such as analyzing threats, triaging phishing incidents, or optimizing conditional access policies.

Agents utilize security compute units (SCUs) to operate just like other features in Security Copilot. They integrate seamlessly with Microsoft Security solutions and the broader supported partner ecosystem and fit naturally into existing workflows. Agents learn based on feedback and keep you in control on the actions it takes.

### Agent terminology in Microsoft Security Copilot

To effectively use Security Copilot agents, it's essential to understand the terminology used when working with agents.

| Term         | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| **Trigger**  | An event or condition that tells an agentic system to initiate an action or series of actions. |
| **Permissions** | The level of authorization an AI agent is given by an admin during configuration that enables it to access specific information or carry out its tasks. |
| **Identity** | The credentials that the agent uses when it runs. |
| **Plugins**  | A component that extends what an agent can do by giving it access to capabilities in Microsoft and non-Microsoft services and public websites through APIs. While some plugins may be required to run an agent, some agents may employ optional plugins that can enhance its functionality by providing access to more data sources or tools.|
| **Role-based access control (RBAC)** | Determines who can view and manage the outputs generated by agents in Microsoft Security Copilot, and ensures that sensitive information is accessible only to authorized users. |

### Microsoft Agents

Security Copilot includes agents that are seamlessly integrated with Microsoft security solutions. Microsoft agents include:

- **Threat Intelligence Briefing Agent**: Curates relevant threat intelligence based on an organization's attributes and exposure.
- **Conditional Access Optimization Agent**: Embedded in Microsoft Entra, the  Conditional Access optimization agent ensures all users are protected by policy. It recommends policies and changes based on best practices aligned with Zero Trust and Microsoft's learnings. In preview, the agent evaluates policies requiring multifactor authentication (MFA), enforces device based controls (device compliance, app protection policies, and Domain Joined Devices), and blocks legacy authentication and device code flow.
- **Phishing Triage Agent**: Embedded in Microsoft Defender, the Phishing Triage Agent helps security operations analysts to triage and classify user-submitted phishing incidents. The agent operates autonomously, provides a transparent rationale for its classification verdicts in natural language, and continuously learns and improves its accuracy based on feedback provided by analysts.

This list is not all-inclusive.
