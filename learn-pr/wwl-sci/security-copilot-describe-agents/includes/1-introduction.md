Microsoft Security Copilot is a cutting-edge AI-driven platform designed to enhance security workflows by automating tasks and providing actionable insights, making it an essential tool for security engineers.

Imagine you're a security engineer at a mid-sized financial institution. Your team is overwhelmed with the sheer volume of security alerts, phishing attempts, and identity access requests that need to be analyzed daily. Recently, a phishing attack slipped through the cracks, leading to a data breach that could have been prevented with better tools and processes. You’re tasked with finding a solution that not only streamlines your team’s workload but also improves the accuracy and speed of threat detection and response. This is where Microsoft Security Copilot comes in. By using specialized agents like the Phishing Triage Agent and Conditional Access Optimization Agent, you can automate repetitive tasks, generate detailed threat intelligence reports, and optimize access policies—all while integrating seamlessly with tools like Microsoft Defender and Microsoft Entra. These capabilities allow your team to focus on high-priority issues, reduce false positives, and strengthen your organization’s overall security posture.

In this module, you get an introduction to some of the Microsoft Security Copilot agents, including the Threat Intelligence briefing agent, the Conditional Access Optimization agent, and the Phishing Triage agent.
