Security Copilot agents are designed to assist security engineers in automating and enhancing various security tasks. These agents leverage triggers, permissions, identity, and plugins to deliver actionable insights and streamline workflows.

## Define Security Copilot agents and their components
Security Copilot agents are AI-driven tools that automate specific security tasks. They consist of the following components:

- **Triggers**: Events or conditions that initiate an agent's actions. For example, a trigger might be a scheduled time interval or a manual activation.
- **Permissions**: Authorization levels assigned by administrators, enabling agents to access specific data or perform tasks.
- **Identity**: Credentials used by the agent to execute its functions securely.
- **Plugins**: Extensions that enhance an agent's capabilities by integrating with first-party and third-party services through APIs.

These components work together to ensure that Security Copilot agents operate effectively within your organization's security framework.

> [!NOTE]
> Plugins can include integrations with Microsoft Defender services and external APIs to provide additional context and functionality.

## Describe the threat intelligence briefing agent
The Threat Intelligence Briefing Agent simplifies the process of generating detailed threat intelligence reports. It provides timely and relevant insights based on the latest threat actor activities and vulnerability information.

- **Functionality**: This agent correlates Microsoft threat data with real-time customer signals to deliver comprehensive technical analysis in minutes, saving analysts hours or days of manual effort.
- **Triggers**: The agent can run automatically at set intervals or manually when needed.
- **Permissions**: It requires access to data from Defender External Attack Surface Management and Defender Vulnerability Management.
- **Plugins**: The agent uses the Microsoft Defender Threat Intelligence plugin, with optional plugins like Defender External Attack Surface Management and Defender Vulnerability Management for enhanced context.
