Fabrikam, Inc. is preparing to roll out Microsoft Purview Message Encryption to secure sensitive client communications. They enabled Azure Rights Management and confirmed encryption templates are available. Their compliance team wants to automatically encrypt emails sent to external legal partners when certain keywords appear in the subject line. They also want those messages to expire after seven days and display Fabrikam's logo and disclaimer in the message portal. The organization uses Microsoft 365 E5 and has created a mail flow rule to apply encryption with a custom branding template.
