Protecting sensitive data in email is essential for any organization that communicates externally. Whether you're sending financial data to a partner or HR information to a job candidate, it's important to control who can access that message. It's also important to control what they can do with it.

Microsoft Purview Message Encryption gives organizations a way to send encrypted email both inside and outside the organization. With it, you can apply consistent encryption policies, customize the user experience, and even revoke access to messages after they're sent.

Most organizations define their encryption strategy once, and it often stays in place for years. That makes it even more important to design it correctly the first time. In this module, you'll learn how to plan and implement message encryption in Microsoft 365 using Microsoft Purview.
