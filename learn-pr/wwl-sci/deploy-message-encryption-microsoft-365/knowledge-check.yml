  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "Why did Fabrikam need to confirm that Azure Rights Management was enabled before using Microsoft Purview Message Encryption?"
    choices:
    - content: "Because Microsoft Purview Message Encryption requires Azure Rights Management to apply encryption and access controls"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Azure RMS provides the encryption and policy enforcement used by message encryption."
    - content: "Because encryption depends on BitLocker being activated first"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "BitLocker is unrelated to email encryption and secures data at rest, not in transit."
    - content: "Because Azure Rights Management is only required when encrypting attachments"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Azure RMS is required for encrypting email messages themselves, not just attachments."

  - content: "Which feature allows Fabrikam to set a seven-day expiration for external recipients?"
    choices:
    - content: "Applying a sensitivity label with a time limit"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Expiration based on time isn't currently supported with sensitivity labels for email."
    - content: "Using a retention policy in Microsoft Purview"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Retention policies affect data lifecycle, not email access duration through encryption."
    - content: "Using the ExternalMailExpiryInDays parameter in a branding template"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. This setting controls how long a recipient can access the message through the encrypted message portal."

  - content: "Fabrikam applied a custom branding template in their mail flow rule. What is the purpose of this template?"
    choices:
    - content: "It allows them to enforce Microsoft Defender for Office policies"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Branding templates aren't related to Defender for Office. They modify the look of encrypted messages."
    - content: "It customizes the secure portal with their logo and disclaimer"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Branding templates change the appearance of encrypted messages for external recipients."
    - content: "It blocks unauthorized users from replying to encrypted emails"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Reply permissions depend on the template type, but branding alone doesn't block replies."

  - content: "Fabrikam created a mail flow rule that encrypts emails based on subject line keywords. Which method did they use to apply encryption?"
    choices:
    - content: "Applied a sensitivity label through Microsoft Purview Data Loss Prevention"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Sensitivity labels are one way to encrypt email, but the scenario used a mail flow rule."
    - content: "Used Microsoft Defender to quarantine emails for inspection"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Quarantine features aren't related to applying encryption through mail flow rules."
    - content: "Configured a mail flow rule with an encryption template"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The rule applies encryption dynamically based on message content."


  - content: "How can Fabrikam confirm that external legal partners have opened encrypted messages?"
    choices:
    - content: "By reviewing sign-in logs in Microsoft Entra ID"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Sign-in logs don't provide message-level access tracking."
    - content: "By using the Encrypted message portal activities in Microsoft Purview Audit"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Purview Audit tracks access events for encrypted messages viewed in the portal."
    - content: "By exporting Exchange Online mail flow logs"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Mail flow logs show routing but don't confirm whether messages were read."
