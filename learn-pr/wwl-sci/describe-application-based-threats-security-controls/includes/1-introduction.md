In today’s digitally connected world, there's an application to do just about anything. Applications influence and shape so many aspects of our everyday life, including how we interact with our friends, how we work, what goods and services we buy and how we buy them, how we learn, and even how we spend our free time. Because applications play such an important role in our personal and professional lives, they're an attractive target for cybercriminals looking to exploit any opportunity.
