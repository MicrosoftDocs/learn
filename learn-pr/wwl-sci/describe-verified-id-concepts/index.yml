title: Describe the concepts behind Microsoft Entra Verified ID
summary: "Gain an understanding of decentralized identifiers and how they're used to issue and verify credentials, in a way that delivers on the promise of a decentralized identity system where users control their identities."
abstract: |
  By the end of this module, you'll be able to:
    - Describe the challenges with current digital identities and credentials.
    - Describe decentralized identifiers (DIDs).
    - Describe what makes DIDs different than other identifiers.
    - Describe how verifiable credentials work.
prerequisites: |
  - A general understanding of asymmetric cryptography (public-key cryptography) as described in [Describe the concepts of cryptography](/training/modules/describe-concepts-of-cryptography/).
