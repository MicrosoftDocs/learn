quiz:
  questions:
  - content: "What are the four properties that characterize decentralized identifiers (DIDs)"
    choices:
    - content: "Persistent, resolvable, cryptographically verifiable, and decentralized"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. A DID is the first new identifier to meet all four of these properties: persistent, resolvable, cryptographically verifiable, and decentralized."
    - content: "Ephemeral, resolvable, verifiable through a certificate authority, and decentralized"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect.  While DIDs are resolvable, cryptographically verifiable, and decentralized, they aren't ephemeral. DIDs are persistent."
    - content: "Persistent, resolvable, cryptographically verifiable, and centralized"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect.  While DIDs are persistent, resolvable, and cryptographically verifiable, they aren't centralized. A DID is decentralized."
  - content: "What are two key pieces of information that are typically included in a DID document?"
    choices:
    - content: "Public keys and service endpoints"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct.  The public keys and service endpoints associated with a DID are important pieces of information commonly contained in the DID document."
    - content: "Private keys and service endpoints"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect.  Private keys are never shared. A DID document will typically include public keys and service endpoints."
    - content: "The root certificate authority and the public key"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. DIDs don't use certificate authorities. A DID document will typically include public keys and service endpoints."
  - content: "Which of the following statements is true regarding verifiable credentials"
    choices:
    - content: "When a verifier validates the issuer's signature, the verifier can resolve the issuer's DID to obtain the public key, without having to contact the issuer directly."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: ""
    - content: "The verifier must establish a direction connection with the issuer of the credential to verify the credential's validity."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect.  The verifier doesn't need to contact the issuer to validate the credential. The verifier can resolve the issuer's DID to obtain the public key, without having to contact the issuer directly."
    - content: "The issuer of the verifiable credential presents the verifiable credential to the verifier."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. In a verifiable credential transaction, the holder of the credential (the user) controls the presentation of the credential to the verifier."
