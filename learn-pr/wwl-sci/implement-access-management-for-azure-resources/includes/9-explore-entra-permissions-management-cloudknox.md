Microsoft Entra Permissions Management is a cloud infrastructure entitlement management (CIEM) solution. Permissions Management provides comprehensive visibility into permissions assigned to all identities. The software detects, automatically right-sizes, and continuously monitors unused and excessive permissions.

Organizations have to consider permissions management as a central piece of their Zero Trust security to implement least privilege access across their entire infrastructure:

 -  Organizations are increasingly adopting multicloud strategy and are struggling with the lack of visibility and complexity of managing access permissions.
 -  With the proliferation of identities and cloud services, the number of high-risk cloud permissions is increasing. The increase expands the attack surface a bad actor can use to gain access.
 -  IT security teams are under increased pressure to ensure access to their expanding cloud estate is secure and compliant.

| Discover     | Customers can assess permission risks by evaluating gaps between permissions granted and permissions used.                                       |
| Remediate    | Customers can right-size permissions based on usage, then grant new permissions on-demand, and automate just-in-time access for cloud resources. |
| Monitor      | Customers can detect anomalous activities with machine language-powered (ML-powered) alerts and generate detailed forensic reports.              |
