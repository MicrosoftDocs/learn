This module will cover how to assign and manage access to resources in Azure using Azure roles. When you create a resource, you want to know that only specific access is granted to users and groups. Only allow users that need to access data or a resource, the permissions to do so. How can you control access? By assigning a role with the specific permissions needed. There are built-in Azure roles and you can create custom-roles as needed.

An application might also need to have permission to access data or other Azure resources. Learn how to set up managed identities, which allow the application to gain access to only resources you allow. You can give granular access to secrets, keys, and certificates stored in a key vault to your users and applications. You protect both the items stored in the key vault, and who can use them. And finally, you'll look at the new tool Microsoft Entra Permission Management. Learn to gather, review, and restrict the permission assigned across your cloud solutions.
