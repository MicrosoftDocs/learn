Ensuring that your DLP policies are processed in the correct order and that they are tested properly before activation is key to the success of your organization.  Analyzing the performance of DLP policies can be done through dashboards in Microsoft 365.  

Once your DLP policies are active, DLP reports display information about the behavior of DLP policies. They allow you to monitor and respond to unwanted sharing of sensitive data from your organization.

In this module, you will learn about the concept of policy precedence to ensure your policies are being processed according to your needs.  You will also learn about DLP policy testing and how to respond to DLP incidents.
