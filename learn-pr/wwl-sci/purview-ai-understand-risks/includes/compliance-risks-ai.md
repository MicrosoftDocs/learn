AI technologies can introduce new regulatory and compliance risks, especially when prompts or generated content include sensitive data or fall under specific jurisdictional requirements. Microsoft Purview includes **Compliance Manager**, which helps organizations assess and improve their readiness to meet regulatory obligations tied to AI usage.

## Use Compliance Manager to assess AI-specific risks

**Compliance Manager** is a risk assessment tool in Microsoft Purview that helps evaluate how well your organization is meeting regulatory and industry standards. For AI-related usage, it includes **assessments and templates** that cover common control requirements for tools like Microsoft 365 Copilot and other generative AI applications.

These assessments include controls for:

- Protecting sensitive data during AI interactions
- Ensuring audit and retention policies are in place
- Managing non-Microsoft access and API usage
- Aligning AI tool use with regulatory expectations

Each assessment generates a **compliance score** and provides recommendations to improve your posture. You can assign improvement actions to responsible users and track progress over time.

## Apply templates to manage compliance for AI tools

Microsoft regularly publishes **built-in templates** for AI scenarios in Compliance Manager. These templates map specific controls to regulatory standards, including:

- **Microsoft 365 Copilot Data Protection Baseline**
- **Microsoft Copilot for Microsoft 365 (preview)**
- **AI and Large Language Model usage**
- **ISO/IEC standards**, such as ISO/IEC 42001 for AI management systems (where applicable)

Templates can be customized to reflect your organizational context and compliance priorities. They can also be used to track the implementation of Microsoft Purview features, such as sensitivity labels, data loss prevention policies, and retention configurations, which serve as evidence of control effectiveness.

By using these assessments, compliance and risk teams can maintain visibility into AI-related risks and demonstrate due diligence during audits or regulatory reviews.
