quiz:
  questions:
  - content: "What is DevSecOps?"
    choices:
      - content: "A practice that ensures system uptime by maintaining optimal replica volumes."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "DevSecOps isn't concerned with replica volumes of systems, which details replication strategies used in high availability deployment scenarios."
      - content: "A security model used by developers to certify that code changes do not affect production environments."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "There's no certification process involved in DevSecOps. The idea behind DevSecOps is that security mechanisms are integrated throughout the development cycle to increase the overall security posture."
      - content: "A set of principles designed to integrate security testing and evaluation into the software development lifecycle (SDLC)."
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "DevSecOps is short for Development, Security, and Operations, which aims to integrate security activities into all stages of the SDLC to achieve application and infrastructure resilience."
      - content: "A method to monitor customer satisfaction after every release of the product to ensure continuous improvement."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "While monitoring customer satisfaction is essential, it's not directly related to DevSecOps. Monitoring is also more of an Operations concern than something taken care of within the Development phase."
  - content: "What type of threats is the Azure web application firewall designed to protect against?"
    choices:
    - content: "Server level attacks such as shared hosting violations"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Azure Web Application Firewall is deployed in front of a web server farm and protects against layer 7 -application-level- distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks."
    - content: "Phishing attacks and credential stealing attempts"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "As useful as this would be, the WAF is positioned for application-level security only."
    - content: "SQL injection, Cross-site scripting attacks, and HTTP protocol violations"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "These are some of the most common web applications' vulnerability exploits, all of which can be programmed into a well-managed web application firewall policy."
    - content: "Malware propagation and attack repulsion"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "WAF is position around application-level DDoS attack protection, this does NOT include general-purpose malware repulsion"
  - content: What are the benefits of using Azure Key Vault for data encryption in Azure?
    choices:
      - content: It provides a centralized key management solution.
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: Azure Key Vault provides a centralized key management solution, allowing you to manage and protect your encryption keys.
      - content: It improves the performance of applications that use data encryption.
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: Azure Key Vault does not improve the performance of applications that use data encryption, but it can help ensure the security of encryption keys.
      - content: It reduces the cost of data encryption in Azure.
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: Azure Key Vault does not reduce the cost of data encryption in Azure, but it can help ensure the security of encryption keys.
      - content: It makes it easier to access and process encrypted data.
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: Azure Key Vault does not make it easier to access or process encrypted data, but it can help ensure the security of encryption keys.
