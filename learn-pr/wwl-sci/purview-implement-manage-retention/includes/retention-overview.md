In today's digital environment, managing organizational data efficiently and securely is essential. Microsoft Purview Data Lifecycle Management and Records Management help organizations control how long data is retained and when it's deleted. These tools support compliance, reduce risk, and strengthen governance. By using retention policies and retention labels, organizations can apply consistent settings across Microsoft 365 to keep data as long as needed and remove it when it's no longer useful or required.

## Understand retention policies and retention labels

Microsoft Purview provides tools like retention policies and retention labels to help businesses manage their data effectively and comply with regulations. Retention policies are used to manage data on a large scale, applying to entire systems like all company emails or entire SharePoint sites, which simplifies the enforcement of regulatory compliance. On the other hand, retention labels offer more precise control, allowing specific settings to be applied to individual items such as a single email or document. These labels are especially useful because they maintain their settings if the item is moved within the organization. By using these features, organizations can ensure their data is secure, manage it in accordance with legal requirements, and optimize their storage practices to reduce risks and costs.

### Retention policies

Retention policies apply retention settings at the container level, such as entire sites or mailboxes. These policies are designed to automatically enforce retention settings across large datasets, ensuring compliance and reducing the need for manual intervention. For instance, a retention policy can be applied to retain all emails in a user mailbox for seven years. This adheres to regulatory requirements such as the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which mandates the retention of certain financial records.

### Retention labels

Retention labels apply retention settings at the item level, such as specific documents or emails. This granular control allows for more tailored data management, enabling different retention periods and actions for different types of content within the same container. For example, within a single SharePoint site, some documents might need to be retained for five years while others for 10 years. Retention labels can accommodate these varying requirements and provide options such as starting the retention period from when the content was labeled or based on an event.

### Retention label policies

Retention label policies are used to publish and apply retention labels to specific locations. These policies automate the application of labels based on conditions like content type or sensitivity, helping in consistently managing data without manual oversight.

### Differences between retention policies and labels

The main differences between retention policies and labels are their scope and application:

- **Scope**: Retention policies are applied at the container level, such as all emails in a mailbox, while retention labels are applied at the item level, like specific documents or emails.
- **Granularity**: Retention labels offer more granular control, allowing different retention settings within the same container.
- **Mobility**: Retention labels move with the content if it's transferred within the organization, ensuring continuous application of the retention settings.
- **Customization**: Retention labels provide more options for managing your data. For example, you can start the retention period based on an event or mark content as a record for regulatory compliance.

## Importance of data lifecycle and records management

Effective data lifecycle and records management are crucial for several reasons:

- **Regulatory compliance**: Many industries are subject to regulations that mandate how long data must be retained. For example, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) requires medical records and other related health information to be retained for a minimum period.
- **Risk mitigation**: Proper retention and disposal of data help reduce the risk of data breaches and litigation. By deleting data that's no longer needed, organizations can minimize their exposure to potential security threats and legal actions.
- **Operational efficiency**: Managing data lifecycle effectively ensures that users work only with current and relevant content, improving productivity and decision-making. Old and obsolete data can be a burden, both in terms of storage costs and the efficiency of data retrieval.

## How retention settings work

Retention settings can be configured to for these outcomes:

- **Retain-only**: Keep content for a specified period or indefinitely.
- **Delete-only**: Permanently delete content after a specified period.
- **Retain and then delete**: Keep content for a specified period and then permanently delete it.

When content is subject to retention settings, it remains in its original location. Users can continue to work with their documents or emails as usual. However, if the content is edited or deleted, a copy is automatically retained in a secure location such as the Preservation Hold library in SharePoint or the Recoverable Items folder in Exchange.

## Key concepts and terminology

As you begin to apply retention policies and labels within Microsoft Purview, it's important to understand several fundamental concepts that govern how these tools operate:

- **Retention period**: Retention periods define how long data should be kept before it can be deleted. They can be set in days, months, years, or to be kept indefinitely, depending on organizational needs and compliance requirements.
- **Auto-apply**: Automatically assigns retention labels to content based on conditions like content type or sensitive information, enhancing consistency and management efficiency.
- **File plans**: File plans are detailed inventories of the record categories or types that an organization creates or receives, along with the associated business functions, retention periods, and other metadata. In Microsoft Purview, file plans help manage and organize retention labels more effectively, allowing for bulk actions and easier oversight.
- **Event-based retention**: Initiates a retention period based on specific events such as contract expiration or employee termination, aligning with regulatory needs that require event-triggered data preservation.
- **Adaptive and static scopes**: Adaptive scopes dynamically apply policies based on ongoing conditions or changes in your environment, while static scopes apply policies to fixed locations or data sets, providing flexibility in policy application depending on organizational dynamics.

Retention policies and labels give organizations the control needed to manage data lifecycles in line with compliance requirements and operational priorities.
