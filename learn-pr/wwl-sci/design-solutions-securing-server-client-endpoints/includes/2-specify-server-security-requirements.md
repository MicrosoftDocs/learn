## Network Security

### 1.1: Protect Azure resources within virtual networks

**Guidance**: When you create an Azure virtual machine (VM), you must create a virtual network (virtual network) or use an existing virtual network and configure the VM with a subnet. Ensure that all deployed subnets have a Network Security Group applied with network access controls specific to your applications trusted ports and sources.

Alternatively, if you have a specific use case for a centralized firewall, Azure Firewall can also be used to meet those requirements.

**Responsibility**: Customer

### 1.2: Monitor and log the configuration and traffic of virtual networks, subnets, and network interfaces

**Guidance**: Use the Microsoft Defender for Cloud to identify and follow network protection recommendations to help secure your Azure Virtual Machine (VM) resources in Azure. Enable NSG flow logs and send logs into a Storage Account for traffic audit for the VMs for unusual activity.

**Responsibility**: Customer

### 1.3: Protect critical web applications

**Guidance**: If using your virtual machine (VM) to host web applications, use a network security group (NSG) on the VM's subnet to limit what network traffic, ports and protocols are allowed to communicate. Follow a least privileged network approach when configuring your NSGs to only allow required traffic to your application.

You can also deploy Azure Web Application Firewall (WAF) in front of critical web applications for extra inspection of incoming traffic. Enable Diagnostic Setting for WAF and ingest logs into a Storage Account, Event Hubs, or Log Analytics Workspace.

**Responsibility**: Customer

### 1.4: Deny communications with known-malicious IP addresses

**Guidance**: Enable Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Standard protection on the Virtual Networks to guard against DDoS attacks. Using Microsoft Defender for Cloud Integrated Threat Intelligence, you can monitor communications with known malicious IP addresses. Configure appropriately Azure Firewall on each of your Virtual Network segments, with Threat Intelligence enabled and configured to "Alert and deny" for malicious network traffic.

You can use Microsoft Defender for Cloud's Just In Time Network access to limit exposure of Windows Virtual Machines to the approved IP addresses for a limited period. Also, use Microsoft Defender for Cloud Adaptive Network Hardening to recommend NSG configurations that limit ports and source IPs based on actual traffic and threat intelligence.

**Responsibility**: Customer
