The top security challenges organizations face include:
- An increase in the number and sophistication of attacks.
- A talent shortage that is driving the need for automation, integration, and consolidation of security tools.
- Visibility into security, privacy, compliance, and governance.

Organizations need to act quickly to address all the security challenges they face, but working at human speed, even if there weren't a talent shortage, isn't enough. Organizations need to work at machine speed.

Microsoft Security Copilot is an AI-powered, cloud-based security analysis tool that enables analysts to respond to threats quickly, process signals at machine speed, and assess risk exposure more quickly than may otherwise be possible.

### Use cases

Security Copilot focuses on making the following highlighted use cases easy to use.

- Investigate and remediate security threats - gain context for incidents to quickly triage complex security alerts into actionable summaries and remediate quicker with step-by-step response guidance
- Build KQL queries or analyze suspicious scripts - eliminate the need to manually write query-language scripts or reverse engineer malware scripts with natural language translation to enable every team member to execute technical tasks
- Understand risks and manage security posture of the organization - get a broad picture of your environment with prioritized risks to uncover opportunities to improve posture more easily
- Troubleshoot IT issues faster - synthesize relevant information rapidly and receive actionable insights to identify and resolve IT issues quickly
- Define and manage security policies - define a new policy, cross-reference it with others for conflicts, and summarize existing policies to manage complex organizational context quickly and easily
- Configure secure lifecycle workflows - build groups and set access parameters with step-by-step guidance to ensure a seamless configuration to prevent security vulnerabilities
- Develop reports for stakeholders - get a clear and concise report that summarizes the context and environment, open issues, and protective measures prepared for the tone and language of the report’s audience

These use cases represent just a few of the capabilities that Copilot delivers and that helps make analysts more productive and also helps up-level them.

### Standalone and embedded experience

You can experience Copilot through the dedicated site, also referred to as the standalone experience. Users interact with Copilot through the prompt bar. In the prompt bar, users make requests in natural language and receive response outputs as text, images, or documents.

Additionally, some Microsoft security products embed Copilot capabilities directly within the products’ user interface. This experience is referred to as the embedded experience. Microsoft Defender XDR, for example, enables Copilot capabilities including summarizing incidents, analyzing scripts, generating KQL queries, and more.

More information on both the standalone and embedded experience are covered in subsequent modules. Images shown throughout the rest of this module are based on the standalone experience.

### Natural language processing (NLP)

Copilot is built using Azure OpenAI Services and is designed to integrate with existing security tools and processes, making it easier for organizations to improve their overall security posture. Azure OpenAI Services provides REST API access to OpenAI's powerful large language models (LLMs) for natural language processing (NLP), while providing security capabilities of Microsoft Azure.

With access to the powerful LLMs for NLP, Copilot is able to read, decipher, and make sense of human languages, enabling users to securely interact with it using natural language. Although the LLMs are trained on a vast amount of information that endows Copilot with broad general knowledge and problem solving abilities, it’s not enough. Security analysts expect their copilot to be trained on security and that is where the integration with existing security tools and processes comes into play.

### Integration with Security-specific sources

Copilot combines powerful LLMs with security-specific sources from Microsoft. These security-specific sources are informed by Microsoft’s unique global threat intelligence, more than 65 trillion daily signals, and incorporates information from a growing set of security solutions using plug-ins and connections to knowledge bases. Through plug-ins, Copilot integrates with Microsoft's own security products, non-Microsoft products, and open-source intelligence feeds. Connections to an organization's knowledge bases gives Copilot more context, resulting in responses that are more relevant, specific, and customized to the user. Through the powerful combination of advanced general models and security specific sources, Copilot is able to learn at machine speed to help analysts identify and respond to emerging threats.

The information you give Copilot will only be accessible to your organization. Your data is your data, and it's protected by comprehensive enterprise compliance and security controls. Your data isn't used to train the foundation AI models.
