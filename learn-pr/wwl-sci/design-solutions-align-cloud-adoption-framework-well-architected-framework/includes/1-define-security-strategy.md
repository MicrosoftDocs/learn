Before diving into specific frameworks, you need to understand why a deliberate security strategy matters. Cloud adoption changes *how* you achieve security objectives—not *what* those objectives are. Your organization must still protect confidentiality, integrity, and availability. However, the tactics, tools, and team structures that worked on-premises often don't translate directly to cloud environments.

## Why security strategy must evolve

Traditional security approaches create friction in cloud adoption. When security teams default to "no" or rely exclusively on network perimeter controls, they face two problems:

- **Exclusion from decisions**: Business and IT teams bypass security involvement to maintain velocity, leaving security gaps in cloud deployments.
- **Blind spots**: Legacy tools designed for on-premises environments can't detect cloud-native attack patterns or protect identities across distributed systems.

A modern security strategy embraces the shared responsibility model, shifts focus from network perimeters to identity-based controls, and uses cloud-native tools for detection and response.

## Two strategic objectives

As a security architect, your cloud security strategy should address two complementary goals:

| Objective | Focus | Example |
|-----------|-------|---------|
| **Security of the cloud** | Protecting cloud resources | Integrate security into cloud service planning and operations |
| **Security from the cloud** | Using cloud to improve security | Adopt cloud-native security tools like Microsoft Sentinel and Defender for Cloud |

These objectives aren't sequential—you pursue both simultaneously throughout your cloud journey.

## Frameworks guide strategy execution

Defining a security strategy is essential, but executing that strategy requires structured guidance. Microsoft provides two frameworks that translate strategic intent into architectural decisions:

- **Cloud Adoption Framework (CAF)**: Guides your organization's cloud adoption journey, with the Secure methodology addressing security at each phase
- **Well-Architected Framework (WAF)**: Provides design principles for building secure, reliable workloads

The following units explore these frameworks in detail, showing how they help you operationalize your security strategy across organizational, environmental, and workload scopes.
