The Azure Well-Architected Framework is a set of guiding tenets that can be used to improve the quality of a workload. The framework consists of five pillars of architectural excellence:

- Reliability
- Security
- Cost Optimization
- Operational Excellence
- Performance Efficiency

Incorporating these pillars helps produce a high quality, stable, and efficient cloud architecture:

| Pillar | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Reliability | The ability of a system to recover from failures and continue to function. |
| Security | Protecting applications and data from threats. |
| Cost Optimization | Managing costs to maximize the value delivered. |
| Operational Excellence | Operations processes that keep a system running in production. |
| Performance Efficiency | The ability of a system to adapt to changes in load. |
