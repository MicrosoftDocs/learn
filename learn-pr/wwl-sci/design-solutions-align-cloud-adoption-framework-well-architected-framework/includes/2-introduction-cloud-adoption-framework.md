The Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework for Azure is a full lifecycle framework that enables cloud architects, IT professionals, and business decision makers to achieve their cloud adoption goals. It provides best practices, documentation, and tools that help you create and implement business and technology strategies for the cloud. 

Following best practices for the Cloud Adoption Framework allows your organization to better align business and technical strategies and ensure success. 

The Cloud Adoption Framework brings together cloud adoption best practices from Microsoft employees, partners, and customers. It consists of tools, documentation, and proven practices. The tools it includes help you shape your technology, business, and people strategies to achieve the best business outcomes possible through your cloud adoption effort. 

The Cloud Adoption Framework consists of these different methodologies:

- **Strategy**: Align cloud adoption initiatives to measurable business goals and ROI targets.
- **Plan**: Create a comprehensive, stakeholder-aligned plan for cloud transformation.
- **Ready**: Deploy enterprise-ready Azure environments that scale securely.
- **Adopt**: Deploy production workloads in Azure that deliver business value.
- **Govern**: Maintain enterprise control, compliance, and cost optimization.
- **Secure**: Protect workloads against evolving cyber threats and vulnerabilities.
- **Manage**: Ensure operational excellence and continuous optimization.

Each methodology listed above is part of a broad cloud adoption lifecycle. The foundational methodologies (Strategy, Plan, Ready, Adopt) execute sequentially to build enterprise-grade Azure foundations, while the operational methodologies (Govern, Secure, Manage) run in parallel throughout your cloud lifecycle to ensure sustained success and operational excellence.

### Why use the Cloud Adoption Framework?

The Cloud Adoption Framework is about adopting cloud technologies and integrating them into your business. 
- It provides proven practices to govern, secure, and manage all workloads. 
- It provides structured processes for migrating, modernizing, and building cloud‑native solutions. 
- Throughout each stage of adoption, the framework guides you to the right tools, architectures, and other resources to help you achieve your organizational goals. 

The framework integrates with the Well-Architected Framework, which is discussed in a subsequent unit of this module  the [Azure Architecture Center](/azure/architecture/).

### Cloud Adoption Framework scenarios 

The Cloud Adoption Framework provides technology-focused guidance tailored to complex business requirements and technical architectures. These scenarios apply the framework's proven methodologies to real-world implementation challenges, delivering actionable roadmaps and technology-specific best practices for accelerated deployment success.

Included amongst the list of scenarios are AI agents and AI adoption.

- AI Adoption - The Cloud Adoption Framework (CAF) provides a structured process for adopting AI solutions in Azure.
- AI Agent adoption - The AI agent adoption scenario provides a structured framework to help organizations successfully adopt AI agents as part of their broader AI adoption strategy. It addresses the unique considerations that AI agents introduce. It also includes strategies for designing an organization-wide data architecture to support AI agents at scale.
