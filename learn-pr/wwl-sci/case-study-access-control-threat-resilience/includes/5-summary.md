Now that you completed the case study, compare the decisions made in the simulation to practices within your own organization and consider how unified identity governance, secure access across environments, and coordinated threat response can be improved across a hybrid infrastructure that spans legacy systems and cloud-hosted workloads.

In this case study module, you:

- Explored the operational and security challenges commonly associated with fragmented identity systems, legacy infrastructure, and inconsistent access governance.
- Learned how to apply Zero Trust principles using Microsoft technologies to modernize access control, improve threat detection, and enforce compliance across hybrid environments.
- Applied architectural reasoning to assess threats and design secure solutions.
