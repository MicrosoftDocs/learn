This module introduces you to a real-world scenario focused on enhancing user access control and threat resilience in a hybrid enterprise environment. Based on Contoso Healthcare Solutions' environment, the case study highlights common identity governance and threat response challenges faced by organizations operating across legacy on-premises systems and cloud-hosted workloads.

Through this case study, you analyze business requirements, match technical capabilities to meet those needs, and design cohesive solutions that incorporate all of the required functions.

In this case study module, you:

- Explore the operational and security challenges commonly associated with fragmented identity systems, legacy infrastructure, and inconsistent access governance.
- Learn how to apply Zero Trust principles using Microsoft technologies to modernize access control, improve threat detection, and enforce compliance across hybrid environments.
- Apply architectural reasoning to assess threats and design secure solutions.
