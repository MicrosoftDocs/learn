Organizations need a structured way to track and document how personal data is used across their data estates. Many rely on manual processes, such as spreadsheets and surveys, to record data processing activities. These methods require ongoing updates, are time-consuming to manage, and often fail to reflect real-time changes in data use. Without an automated system, privacy teams might struggle to keep assessments current, increasing the risk of incomplete documentation and compliance gaps.

**Microsoft Priva Privacy Assessments (preview)** helps address these challenges by automating privacy assessments. It works with **Microsoft Purview Data Map** to detect changes in data processing and automatically assign assessments when predefined conditions are met. This allows privacy teams to maintain up-to-date records, evaluate privacy risks, and ensure compliance without relying on manual tracking.

## Scenario

Your organization is rolling out new applications that collect customer data in multiple regions. Right now, privacy assessments are handled manually, making it difficult to keep up with changes. Privacy teams spend more time collecting information than analyzing risks and ensuring compliance.

To address this, your team needs a solution that streamlines privacy assessments, automatically assigns them when data processing changes, and ensures compliance records remain accurate over time.

## Learning objectives

By the end of this module, you'll be able to:

- Explain the purpose and benefits of Microsoft Priva Privacy Assessments.
- Configure the metamodel and register assets for privacy assessments.
- Create and manage privacy assessments using templates and custom questionnaires.
- Define privacy rules to automate the assignment of assessments.
- Configure risk settings and evaluate privacy risks based on assessment responses.
