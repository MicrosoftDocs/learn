Tracking and evaluating how personal data is used is an important part of privacy compliance, but manual assessments can be difficult to maintain. Many organizations rely on spreadsheets, surveys, or other manual processes to document data use, but these methods require ongoing updates and can quickly become outdated. Without an automated approach, privacy teams might struggle to track changes in data processing, leading to gaps in documentation and increased compliance risks.

Microsoft Priva Privacy Assessments (preview) helps solve this problem by automating the assignment and management of privacy assessments. With Microsoft Purview Data Map, privacy rules can trigger assessments when new data processing activities are detected. This ensures evaluations keep up with how data is actually used. Defining business assets in the metamodel provides context so assessments focus on data use rather than just data storage. Risk settings and structured questionnaires create a standardized way to evaluate privacy risks and keep compliance records accurate.

In this module, you learned to:

- Explain the purpose and benefits of Microsoft Priva Privacy Assessments.
- Configure the metamodel and register assets for privacy assessments.
- Create and manage privacy assessments using templates and custom questionnaires.
- Define privacy rules to automate the assignment of assessments.
- Configure risk settings and evaluate privacy risks based on assessment responses.

Without an automated system, privacy teams must track data processing changes manually while ensuring compliance records remain accurate. At the same time, they would have to ensure compliance records stay accurate while keeping up with evolving data practices. Microsoft Priva Privacy Assessments simplifies this process, reducing manual effort, improving data governance, and ensuring privacy evaluations remain up to date.
