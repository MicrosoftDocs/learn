The information protection team at a large corporation faces the urgent task of identifying and classifying sensitive information from both legacy and newly acquired sources. [Having already defined and identified sensitive information types across the organization](/training/modules/purview-ninja-discover-define-sits/), the next priority is to ensure this data is properly protected through a robust labeling strategy. By applying customizable sensitivity labels, the organization can classify, control, and monitor sensitive information as it moves across environments and departments. This approach not only maintains compliance with established policies but also ensures that confidential content remains protected even when shared externally or stored on collaborative platforms.

Automatic, manual, and on-demand labeling all play a role in achieving consistent, policy-driven data governance. Together, these methods provide the visibility and safeguards needed to protect the organizationâ€™s entire data landscape.

This module focuses on developing and implementing a labeling strategy to protect sensitive content across the organization.
