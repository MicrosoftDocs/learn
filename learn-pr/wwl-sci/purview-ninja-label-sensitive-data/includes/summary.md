Customizable sensitivity labels, applied automatically or manually, enable organizations to secure and monitor sensitive data with precise access controls, both internally and when sharing externally. These labels can be tailored to specific departments or groups, ensuring that only authorized users can access, edit, or share confidential information. By integrating labeling solutions with platforms like Microsoft Purview, organizations maintain robust protection across both active and dormant files. This approach streamlines compliance efforts, reduces the risk of data exposure, and supports a proactive, organization-wide security posture.

## Key takeaways

- Implementing customizable sensitivity labels is essential for classifying, protecting, and monitoring sensitive information across organizational environments, especially following acquisitions.

- Sensitivity labels are portable and retain their protection when files are shared externally, and label policies can target specific departments to ensure only relevant users have access.

- Each label can be configured with unique permissions and published to particular groups, allowing granular control over who can view, edit, or share sensitive data, as illustrated by the provided labeling matrix.

- Automation, including client-side and service-side auto-labeling, ensures consistent and scalable application of labels, reducing reliance on manual processes and minimizing human error.

- Container-level and on-demand classification strategies, such as default labels for document libraries and scanning historical files, further enhance data protection by covering both active and dormant content.
