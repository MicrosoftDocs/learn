An Ethereum network is private if its nodes are isolated and not connected to a public network such as mainnet or a testnet. Private networks include development networks, or consortium networks.

## Development networks

When you develop an Ethereum application, you'll start by running it on a private network to see how it works before deploying it. Similar to how you create a local server on your computer for web development, you can create a local blockchain instance to test your blockchain solution.

On your development network, you can create, test, and iterate changes to your solution quickly. You can make changes to your solution in development much more seamlessly and quickly than with a public testnet. Tools such as [Ganache](https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache) and [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) are most commonly used to run personal Ethereum development networks.

## Solutions for consortium networks

Consortiums are permissioned and require an invite to participate. They ensure security, privacy, compliance, and performance. There are many options for consortium blockchains, including Hyperledger Besu, R3 Corda, and Quorum. Let's explore two popular options for consortium blockchains.

### Hyperledger Besu

[Hyperledger Besu](https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/?azure-portal=true) is an open-source Ethereum client developed under the Apache 2.0 license and written in Java.

Besu is used to develop enterprise applications requiring secure, high-performance transaction processing in a private network. Besu has a command-line interface and JSON-RPC API for running, maintaining, debugging, and monitoring nodes in an Ethereum network. The API supports typical Ethereum functionalities such as:

- Ether mining
- Smart contract development
- Decentralized application (Dapp) development.

Hyperledger Besu is a popular Ethereum client. It's unique because it offers a client that can be used in either public networks or private, consortium-based networks. It can be deployed in various [ways](https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/HowTo/Get-Started/Installation-Options/Install-Binaries/), and recently a preview has been made available in [Azure](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/marketplace/apps/consensys.hyperledger-besu-quickstart?tab=Overview).

More information about configuring and deploying can be found on the [Hyperledger Besu website.](https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/latest/Tutorials/Examples/Private-Network-Example/)

### R3 Corda

The [Corda Platform](https://www.r3.com/corda-platform/?azure-portal=true) is a private, permissioned blockchain focused on supporting trusted communication, interactions, and transactions between entities. [Corda Enterprise](https://www.r3.com/corda-enterprise/) offers the core attributes of Corda open source along with other business requirements enterprises expect when licensing software. The Corda protocol is built on a strong identity model, where every node's identity *must* have been properly on boarded.

Signing identities only exist on the Corda nodes. Client applications in a Corda-based solution trigger the workflow that was registered on the target Corda node, and monitor the progression of the flow. In contrast, Ethereum, where client applications play a critical role in the transaction lifecycle, holds the signing keys and signing transactions before they're submitted to the nodes. Essentially, Corda applications, or [CorDapps](https://docs.corda.net/docs/corda-os/4.7/cordapp-overview.html) for short, completely live on the Corda nodes.

There's a [Corda VS https://github.com/corda/vscode-corda) which supports Corda development. From VS Code, go to the **Extensions** icon, select the icon, and then enter **Corda** to install the extension.
