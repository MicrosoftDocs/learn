The token is one of blockchain's most powerful and often most misunderstood tools. It's typically misunderstood, because a blockchain token can represent almost anything that we want to assign a value to whether that's something virtual or a real-world, tangible object.

A token can grant users special permissions on a platform, exclusive access to a service, or show ownership. Tokens could also represent cryptocurrencies with monetary value. Let's dive into the history of tokens and explore various use cases to demonstrate what exactly a token is and what you can do with them.

## History of tokens

Tokens are not a new thing and have existed since long before the emergence of blockchain.

Tokens have represented any form of economic value. Shells and beads were probably the earliest types of tokens used to trade goods with. Present-day types of tokens include casinos chips, vouchers, airline points, stock certificates, concert entry tokens, dinner reservations, ID cards, or club memberships. Really, the list of possible token uses can go on and on somewhat endlessly.

Even our typical fiat currency, which includes cash and coins, is a type of token. The point is, you can build up tokens and trade them in to get something of value or some service in return.

In computing, tokens are used to allow a right to perform some operation or manage access rights.  

A web browser, for example, sends tokens to websites when we surf the internet that contain information about our computers, like the browser and IP address. Another examples of computer tokens are QR codes. QR codes are scanned and then redirect us to a web page or some service.

## Blockchain tokens

Blockchain tokens combine concepts of more general tokens: ownership rights to some property, service access, or monetary value. This property or service can be public, like an Ethereum network that anyone can join and participate in. Or the property or service can be private, like a house that is purchased by an owner, or points on your account that you trade in to purchase items.

Blockchain tokens represent a set of rules which are programmed in a smart contract. Every token belongs to a blockchain address which identifies it uniquely. These tokens are accessible with a [crypto wallet](https://ethereum.org/en/wallets/) so that only the person who has the private key for that address can access those tokens.

The Ethereum blockchain platform is based on the use of tokens, which can be bought, sold, and traded. Tokens are like Ether (ETH) but may have different design decisions, purposes and help operate different decentralized apps (DAPPS) and facilitate crypto-economics of different Blockchain ecosystems.

Take for example, Augur. [Augur](https://www.augur.net/) is a network that functions as a prediction market - you can think of it as a betting platform. Augur has its own token named REP. This is no different than you using tokens perhaps to take public transport. We have fiat or local currency, for example the Canadian dollar (CAD), which sometimes also comes in coins, and also Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) tokens. Each TTC token allows you to take 1 subway ride. You can purchase TTC tokens using CAD (just like you can purchase REP using ETH) but they are not the same thing. TTC tokens are specifically for the ecosystem of Toronto Transit, and the REP tokens are for the Augur ecosystem.

## Two categories of blockchain tokens

There are different kinds of tokens available and they usually fall into two categories:

- **fungible:**
  - equivalent
  - exchangeable
  - It matters how much you have
- **non-fungible**
  - unique
  - distinct
  - It matters which ones you have

When you break it down, blockchain tokens are essentially smart contracts that make use of the Ethereum blockchain. Everything in Ethereum can be represented as a smart contract, and there are no rules restricting what smart contracts do, so the community has developed standards to document how a token contract can operate with other contracts. The standards also describe the implementation details of each token type.
