### Set up your environment

To learn most effectively throughout this module, we recommend that you set up your environment so you can follow along.

Complete these steps to set up your environment:

1. Download and install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com?azure-portal=true). This is free and works on Windows, Mac, and Linux. Select the stable build for your platform.
2. Download and install the [Python extension for Visual Studio code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python). This will include first installing a supported version of Python.
3. Activate the [Anaconda environment](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/jupyter-support?azure-portal=true) to be able to run Jupyter notebooks.
4. Set up a [Data Science environment](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/data-science-tutorial?azure-portal=true) to be able to use NumPy and Pandas.

### Test your environment

If you have successfully set up your environment with VS Code, Python, Anaconda, and the NumPy and Pandas libraries, you should be able to run a Jupyter notebook inside of VS Code.

1. Clone the [Reactor repository](https://github.com/microsoft/Reactors?azure-portal=true) and open the folder that corresponds to this module in VS Code.
2. Run the [`Test-Setup-Config.ipynb`](https://github.com/microsoft/Reactors/blob/main/microsoft-learn-resources/Intro-python-data-science/Test-Setup-Config.ipynb) file to ensure you're ready to continue through the module.

### Working through this learn module

As you're working through this module, you'll be encouraged to try out code. Use the files you cloned to do this.

Jupyter Notebooks are divided into cells. Each cell contains either text written in the Markdown markup language or a space in which to write and execute computer code. Because all the code resides inside code cells, you can run each code cell inline rather than using a separate Python interactive window.

> [!Note]
> This learn module is designed to have you run code cells one by one. As you complete these modules, you are encouraged to copy the code snippets into your VS Code Jupyter Notebook and run each cell one at a time.
