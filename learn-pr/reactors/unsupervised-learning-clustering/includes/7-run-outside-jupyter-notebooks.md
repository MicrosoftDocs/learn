> **SARAH** - TBD - This unit is odd because it's asking students to run python in VS Code, but now that the entire learn path is in VS Code, perhaps this is redundant.

Python code does not have to reside in notebooks. Simple programs can provide a useful tool for investigating your data. To see this in action, open the program Sec2-1-k-Means.py in the GitHub repository in Microsoft Visual Studio Code. The program is largely the code from earlier in this notebook. Now run Sec2-1-k-Means.py from the command line interface on your local computer. It will ask for the number of clusters and the file path for the USDA dataset that you have been using in this section.

### Try it yourself

Run Sec2-1-k-Means.py using several different numbers for k (including those indicated by the WCSS graph above). Do they provide intuitive groupings of food groups?

**SARAH** TBD - add hint?
