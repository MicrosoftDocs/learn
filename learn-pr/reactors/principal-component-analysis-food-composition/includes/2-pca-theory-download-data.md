Principal component analysis (PCA) is an algorithm that helps us get a dataset into working condition by removing dimensions that must be calculated in an analysis of the dataset. 

## PCA in theory

One way we reduce the number of dimensions we have to work with is by reducing the number of features considered in an analysis. PCA provides another way: reducing the number of dimensions that we have to work with by projecting our feature space into a lower-dimensional space. We can do this because in most real-world problems, data points aren't spread uniformly across all dimensions. Although some features might be nearly constant, others are highly correlated. The highly correlated data points lie close to a lower-dimensional subspace.

In the following image, the data points aren't spread across the entire plane, but are clumped roughly in an oval. Because the cluster (or any cluster) is roughly elliptical, it can be mathematically described by two values: its major (long) axis and its minor (short) axis. These axes form the *principal components* of the cluster.

We can construct a whole new feature space around this cluster that's defined by two **eigenvectors**: $c_{1}$ and $c_{2}$. Eigenvectors are the vectors that define the linear transformation to this new feature space.

Better still, we don't have to consider all of the dimensions of this new space. Intuitively, we can see that most of the points lie on or close to the line that runs through $c_{1}$. If we project the cluster down from two dimensions to that single dimension, we capture most of the information about this dataset while simplifying our analysis. This ability to extract most of the information from a dataset by considering only a fraction of its definitive eigenvectors forms the heart of PCA.

## Import modules and dataset

You must first clean and prepare the data to conduct PCA on it, so pandas will be essential. You also need NumPy, a bit of scikit-learn, and pyplot.

To add these libraries, run this code:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
%matplotlib inline
```

The dataset we'll use here's the same one that's drawn from the [U.S. Department of Agriculture National Nutrient Database for Standard Reference](https://www.ars.usda.gov/northeast-area/beltsville-md-bhnrc/beltsville-human-nutrition-research-center/?azure-portal=true) that you prepared in the preceding module.

Remember to set the encoding to `latin1` (for µg):

```python
df = pd.read_csv('Data/USDA-nndb-combined.csv', encoding='latin1')
```

We can check the number of columns and rows by using the `info()` method for the DataFrame:

```python
df.info()
```

The output is:

```Output

### Try it yourself

Can you think of a more concise way to check the number of rows and columns in a DataFrame?

  Use one of the [attributes](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.html?azure-portal=true) of the DataFrame.

  Here's a possible solution:

  ```python
  df.count(axis='columns')
  ```

  The output is:

  ```Output
  0       54
  1       54
  2       54
  3       54
  4       54
          ..
  8984    49
  8985    50
  8986    53
  8987    48
  8988    49
  Length: 8989, dtype: int64
  ```
