Blockchain products are useful for a variety of use cases, ranging from supply-chain management to decentralized finance. Blockchain technology is being used across major markets and geographies. As the utilization of blockchain has increased and evolved, so has the development of blockchain applications.

Decentralized apps, or *dapps*, are applications that have code running on a blockchain network. A dapp has front-end code and a graphical user interface that's hooked up in the back end to smart contracts.

In this module, you'll learn all about dapps and how to build your own.
