A [dapp](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/dapps/?azure-portal=true), or a
decentralized application,  uses smart contracts which
execute on a blockchain network and allows users to interact with the application interface either through a web browser or mobile app.

## How do dapps operate

[Dapps](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/dapps/?azure-portal=true?azure-portal=true) differ from traditional applications in that they do not rely on a centralized server network, but instead operate on a decentralized peer-to-peer blockchain network.

A dapp can have frontend code written in any language, just like a traditional web app, that can make calls to its backend. With dapps, the backend are smart contracts that are executed on a blockchain.

Dapps are:

- **Decentralized** which means that they execute independently on a decentralized network and not controlled by a centralized authority.
- **Deterministic** which means that they perform the same function independent of which environment executes the code.
- **[Turing complete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness?azure-portal=true?azure-portal=true)**, which means that they can perform any action which can be coded.
- **Isolated** which means they are executed in a virtual environment known as
[Ethereum Virtual Machine](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/evm/?azure-portal=true?azure-portal=true) so that bugs or other problems won't affect other blocks or the normal functioning of the blockchain network.

## Benefits of dapp development

Outside of providing a way for users to interact with the blockchain network in an easy and visual way, dapps also provide the additional benefits:

- **Zero downtime** once the underlying smart contract and app are deployed on the blockchain network, the network will always be available to serve clients looking to interact with the contract.
- **Privacy** users don't need to provide their true real-world identity to interact with a dapp.
- **Censorship resistance** no entity on the network can prevent users from using the dapp in any way.
- **Data integrity** since data stored on the blockchain is immutable, it is not possible for bad actors to modify or falsify data and transactions.
- **Verifiable behavior** smart contracts and their dapps are guaranteed to execute in a predictable way without a central authority.
