A [dapp](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/dapps/?azure-portal=true), or a decentralized application, uses smart contracts. Smart contracts run on a blockchain network and allow users to interact with the application interface through a web browser or a mobile app.

## How dapps operate

Dapps differ from traditional applications because they don't rely on a centralized server network. Instead, they operate on a decentralized peer-to-peer blockchain network.

A dapp can have front-end code written in any language, just like a traditional web app, that can make calls to its back end, which are smart contracts that run on a blockchain.

Dapps are:

- **Decentralized**. They run independently on a decentralized network and are not controlled by a centralized authority.
- **Deterministic**. They perform the same function no matter which environment runs the code.
- **Turing complete**. They can perform any action that can be coded.
- **Isolated**. They're run in a virtual environment called an
[Ethereum Virtual Machine](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/evm/?azure-portal=true?azure-portal=true). That way, bugs or other problems won't affect other blocks or the normal functioning of the blockchain network.

## Benefits of dapp development

Dapps help users to interact with the blockchain network in an easy and visual way. They also provide these benefits:

- **Zero downtime**. After the underlying smart contract and app are deployed on the blockchain network, the network will always be available to serve clients that want to interact with the contract.
- **Privacy**. Users don't need to provide their real-world identity to interact with a dapp.
- **Censorship resistance**. No entity on the network can prevent users from using the dapp in any way.
- **Data integrity**. Because data stored on the blockchain is immutable, bad actors can't modify or falsify data and transactions.
- **Verifiable behavior**. Smart contracts and their dapps are guaranteed to run in a predictable way without a central authority.

## Examples of dapps

Dapps are being created in nearly every major industry. Most notably, there has been a lot of movement in the areas of finance, arts and collectibles, gaming, and technology. Here are examples across each of those industries to check out and inspire you as you begin to create your own dapps.

[Augur](https://augur.net?azure-portal=true?azure-portal=true) is a platform where you can bet on things like sports, economics, politics, and entertainment. The user interface allows you to trade and to view reporting on both the open and closed bets. The UI for betting is still in progress at this time.

[OpenSea](https://opensea.io?azure-portal=true?azure-portal=true) is a platform where you can buy, sell, and discover limited-edition goods. The dapp allows users to browse items and make an offer or buy for the price listed. Users can also list their goods for sale.

[Cryptokitties](https://www.cryptokitties.co?azure-portal=true?azure-portal=true) is a gaming dapp where you can breed, collect, and sell unique cryptographic kittens. Additionally, you can do things like solve puzzles, earn rewards, and play games with your kitties.

[Brave](https://brave.com?azure-portal=true?azure-portal=true) is a fast and private browser that allows you to earn tokens called BAT that can be donated to web creators, and can soon be used to buy gift cards and other rewards.
