      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This definition best explains Truffle."
    - content: "Drizzle is a collection of libraries to make writing dapps easier."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Drizzle provides tools to make it easier to write dapps."
    - content: "Drizzle is an Ethereum blockchain to run tests and run commands."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This definition best explains Ganache."
    - content: "Drizzle is a set of boilerplates that contain contracts, libraries, and dapps."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This definition best explains Truffle boxes."
  - content: "How do dapps operate?"
    choices:
    - content: "They have front-end code that connects in the back end to smart contracts on a blockchain network."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Dapps have a front-end interface like a traditional web app, and they connect to a smart contract back end."
    - content: "They operate just like traditional apps with a front end that connects to a centralized back-end server."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Dapps are different from traditional apps because their back end is decentralized."
    - content: "They have front-end code that runs on its own, and they don't require a back end to hook up to."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Apps that allow for user interaction must have a back-end server or blockchain network to connect to."
    - content: "They're a set of smart contracts that allow you to interact with them directly by calling their functions."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Not quite. Dapps do connect to smart contracts in the back end, and they must also have a front-end interface."
  - content: "Using the Drizzle Truffle Box, we can start the web server for the project by running which command?"
    choices:
    - content: "npm rebuild"

      explanation: "This command recompiles changes in the React project."
    - content: "npm run start"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. This command starts the development server for React."
    - content: "npm build"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This command compiles the changes in the React project."
    - content: "npm run"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The run command is used immediately before you run a custom-defined command such as start."
