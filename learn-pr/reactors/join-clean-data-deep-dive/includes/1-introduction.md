As a general rule, data scientists assume that about 80 percent of the time and effort devoted to a project will be spent preparing data for analysis. Because most real-world data is split among multiple existing datasets, preparing data means cleaning and joining datasets together in the way that a data scientist needs for analysis. Mastering these skills is essential for undertaking data science.

This section makes extensive use of pandas, the principal Python library for data handling and manipulation. This section assumes some familiarity with pandas and basic Python skills.

To provide an experience more like real-world data science, we'll use real data gathered from theÂ [U.S. Department of Agriculture National Nutrient Database for Standard Reference](https://www.ars.usda.gov/northeast-area/beltsville-md-bhnrc/beltsville-human-nutrition-research-center/?azure-portal=true).
