A smart contract is a program stored inside of a blockchain. Smart contracts extend blockchain from data to code. They represent an agreement between parties. The agreement is coded and when an action happens, the code is executed and provides a response.

All of the terms and conditions of the contracts are programmatically defined. The definition specifies the rules, requirements and rewards for those who participate in the blockchain, and how digital assets are transferred between parties. Each smart contract is assigned a 20 byte address that is used to uniquely identify it.

They execute on their own, send events, call functions and more. They are perfect for blockchain technology because they allow parties that do not know one another to conduct business in a securely specified way without the use of a middleman.

The most prominent use for smart contracts is with Ethereum, the worlds first programmable blockchain, that allows for smart contracts to be defined to help facilitate the transfer of digital assets like Ether.

 The language to write contracts in is Solidity. Solidity is Turing complete which means you can write complicated contracts that are defined and coded in a clear way.  

Since every state transition is logged and immutable it is imperative that you thoroughly test the contract before going to production, because bug fixes can be very costly and even cause critical damage to the system.

The key properties and advantages of smart contracts are that they are:

- **Transparent**: It is publicly readable by others on the blockchain and accessible via APIs
- **Immutable**: Once a smart contract is created it cannot be changed again.
- **Distributed**: Output of the contract is validated and verified by nodes on the network. Contract states can be publicly visible, and in some cases even “private” variables are visible.

## Use cases

- **Insurance**: Smart contracts can simplify and streamline the claims process by automatically triggering a claim when certain events occur. Claim details can be recorded on the blockchain in order to determine the amount of compensation. This would reduce processing times and human errors.
- **Voting**: Smart contracts can be used to make voting automatic and transparent. Each contract can serve as one ballot which represents a voter's identity. Since a blockchain is immutable, it can ensure that votes have not been tampered with and that there is no voting fraud.
- **Supply chain**. Smart contracts can record ownership rights as items move through the supply chain confirming who is responsible for the product at any given time. At any step of the process, the smart contract can be used to find out exactly where the products should be. If any party involved failed to deliver on time, then every other party will see this.
- **Protected copyright content**. Smart contracts can help ensure that the owner of the content can receive royalties in a fair and distributed way.
- **Record keeping**. Many industries will be able to use smart contracts to help improve the speed and security of record keeping. Blockchain technology can allow records to all be digitized and securely encrypted and stored. Plus, access can be gated so that only allowed individuals can access the records.
- **Property ownership**. Smart contracts can be used to record who owns property. This is a much faster and cost-efficient way to record ownership. Smart contracts can also help to facilitate the transfer of ownership.

## Tools for working with smart contracts

There are numerous tools available to help you more effectively develop smart contracts.

### Integrated Development Environments

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/?azure-portal=true): Visual Studio Code is a code editor redefined and optimized for building and debugging modern web and cloud applications. This module will use Visual Studio Code for all exercises.
- [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/?azure-portal=true): Remix is a browser-based compiler and IDE that enables users to build Ethereum contracts with Solidity language and to debug transactions. Remix is a great option to explore sample contracts, and write, test, and deploy your own contracts. We won't be using Remix in this module, but it's an option available for you to try out the contract exercises.

### Extensions

- [Blockchain Development Kit for Ethereum](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=AzBlockchain.azure-blockchain?azure-portal=true): The Blockchain Development Kit extension simplifies how you create, build and deploy smart contracts on Ethereum ledgers. This module will use the help of the Blockchain Development Kit to help write, and test smart contracts.

### Frameworks

- [Truffle Suite](https://www.trufflesuite.com?azure-portal=true): The Truffle tool suite is used to test Ethereum contracts before they are deployed to public ledgers and incur real costs. You want to develop locally and make your life as a developer easier. The suite includes: Truffle, Ganache, and Drizzle. In this module, we will be using Truffle.
- [OpenZeppelin](https://openzeppelin.com/?azure-portal=true): OpenZeppelin provides tools to write, deploy and operate decentralized applications. There are two different products that OpenZeppelin provides- the contracts library and the SDK. We will not be using OpenZeppelin in this module, but it's good to know that this is an option available that can help write secure blockchain applications in the future.
