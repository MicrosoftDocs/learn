You've now made it to the section on machine learning (ML). ML and the branch of computer science in which it resides, artificial intelligence (AI), are so central to data science that ML/AI and data science are synonymous in the minds of many people. The preceding sections demonstrated that there are many other facets to the discipline of data science apart from the prediction and classification tasks that supply so much value to the world. (Remember, at least 80 percent of the effort in most data-science projects is composed of cleaning and manipulating the data to prepare it for analysis.)

That said, ML is fun! In this section, and the next one on data science in the cloud, you'll get to play around with some of the "magic" of data science. You'll start to put into practice the tools you've spent the last five sections learning. Let's get started!

## Types of machine learning

As you get deeper into data science, it might seem like there's a bewildering array of ML algorithms out there. Remember that most ML algorithms fall into three broad categories:

- **Predictive algorithms**: These algorithms analyze current and historical facts to make predictions about unknown events, such as the future or customers' choices.
- **Classification algorithms**: These algorithms teach a program from a body of data. The program then uses that learning to classify new observations.
- **Time-series forecasting algorithms**: These algorithms could be considered a part of predictive algorithms, but their techniques are specialized enough that in many ways they function like a separate category. Time-series forecasting is beyond the scope of this course. We have more than enough work with the focus here on prediction and classification.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you will:

- Fit linear regression models.
- Interpret the output of linear regression models.
- Evaluate linear regression models.
- Perform classification using logistic regression by removing extraneous variables, checking for multicollinearity, handling missing values, and fitting and evaluating your model.
- Fit decision-tree models and analyze output.

## Prerequisites

None.
