Microsoft provides free Azure DevOps accounts for individuals, small teams, and open-source projects. Enterprises can also sign up for Azure DevOps accounts that can scale to thousands of team members. We're going to sign up for a free Azure DevOps account to see how its services can help us on our DevOps journey.

> [!NOTE]
> In this learning path, you'll use Azure DevOps Services, which Microsoft hosts for you. There's also [Azure DevOps Server](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/devops/server?azure-portal=true), the on-premises version of Azure DevOps Services that you can install and run on your own network.

## Create an Azure DevOps account

Follow along with the team by setting up your own free Azure DevOps account.

1. Go to [dev.azure.com](https://dev.azure.com?azure-portal=true).
1. Click the **Start free** button.
1. Sign in using your **Microsoft account**, or if you don't have a Microsoft account, click **Create One!** and complete the steps.

    > [!NOTE]
    > You may have a Microsoft account already. Typically these end with hotmail.com or outlook.com.
1. Review the Terms of Service, Privacy Statement, and Code of Conduct and click **Continue** if you agree to them.

    > [!NOTE]
    > As the person creating the Azure DevOps account, you will automatically become the account owner. Please be considerate when deciding on your account name and avoid existing legal entities.

## Create an organization

Next, set up an organization called Tailspin. Here's how.

1. Click the **Create new organization button** in the right pane.
1. Click **Continue** in the Azure DevOps Terms of Service and Privacy notification window.
1. Create an organization named **Tailspin** next to the **`dev.azure.com/`** field. If you are told that that name is already taken, just add some numbers to the end to make it unique. For example, Tailspin0523.
1. Choose a location near you where your projects will be hosted.
1. Click **Continue**.

The next screen prompts you to create a project. You'll do that in the next module.

Congratulations! In the next module, the team will use Azure Boards to create their first project and backlog.
