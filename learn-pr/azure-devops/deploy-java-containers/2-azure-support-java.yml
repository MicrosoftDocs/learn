  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "What kind of source changes will the typical Java project require in order to run on Azure?"
    choices:
    - content: "Java apps will need to be rewritten in C# or another .NET language before they'll run properly on Azure."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Java is supported as a first-class app platform in Azure."
    - content: "Configuration code will have to be rewritten to connect to Azure's configuration service."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Azure is designed to provide application settings using standard mechanisms, such as configuration files and environment variables."
    - content: "No changes are required."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Java is supported as a first-class app platform in Azure."
  - content: "How does hosting Java apps on Azure differ from hosting apps built for other platforms (like .NET) on Azure?"
    choices:
    - content: "Each app platform has its own dependencies, so developers need to be sure the Azure target they're using is configured correctly."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Just like deploying anywhere else, the application environment needs to account for application prerequisites in order to run properly."
    - content: "Java deployments require use of Java performance and monitoring tools."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "While specialized Java tools will work as expected, your Java deployments will also benefit from the same performance and monitoring tools used by Azure for apps across all platforms."
    - content: "Java deployments are limited to web sites on Azure."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "You can deploy Java apps to App Services, Azure Functions, container-based services, and more."
  - content: "What databases can a Java app deployed on Azure connect to?"
    choices:
    - content: "Azure SQL Database is the only option."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "While Java apps in Azure can connect to Azure SQL Database, they aren't limited in the databases, and services they can access."
    - content: "Azure Database for MySQL is the only option."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "While Java apps in Azure can connect to Azure Database for MySQL, they aren't limited in the databases, and services they can access."
    - content: "They can connect to any database or service."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "There's no limit to the databases or services Java apps can connect to when running on Azure."
