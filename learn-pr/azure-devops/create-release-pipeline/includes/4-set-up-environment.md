The team has been slowly integrating a DevOps strategy into their processes. In this section, you make sure that your environment reflects the team's efforts so far.

To do this, you:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Add a user to ensure Azure DevOps can connect to your Azure subscription.
> * Set up an Azure DevOps project for this module.
> * Add the build pipeline.

## Add a user to Azure DevOps

To complete this module, you need your own [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?azure-portal=true). You can get started with Azure for free.

Although you don't need a subscription to use Azure DevOps to work in it, here you'll use Azure DevOps to deploy to Azure resources that exist in your Azure subscription. To simplify the process, sign in to both your Azure subscription and your Azure DevOps organization under the same Microsoft account.

If you use different Microsoft accounts to sign in to Azure and Azure DevOps, add a user to your DevOps organization under the Microsoft account you use to sign in to Azure. For more information, see [Add organization users and manage access](/azure/devops/organizations/accounts/add-organization-users). When you add the user, choose the **Basic** access level.

Then, sign out of Azure DevOps and sign in again under the Microsoft account you use to sign in to your Azure subscription.

## Get the Azure DevOps project

Make sure your Azure DevOps organization is set up to complete the rest of this module. You'll do this by running a template that creates a project for you in Azure DevOps.

The modules in this learning path form a progression as you follow the Tailspin web team through their DevOps journey. For learning purposes, each module has an associated Azure DevOps project.

### Run the template

Run a template that sets up your Azure DevOps organization.

1. [Get and run the ADOGenerator project](https://github.com/microsoft/AzDevOpsDemoGenerator/blob/main/docs/RunApplication.md) in Visual Studio or the IDE of your choice.

1. When prompted to **Enter the template number from the list of templates**, enter **29** for **Create a release pipeline with Azure Pipelines**, then press **Enter**.

1. Choose your authentication method. You can [set up and use a Personal Access Token (PAT)](/azure/devops/organizations/accounts/use-personal-access-tokens-to-authenticate#create-a-pat) or use device login.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you set up a PAT, If you set up a PAT, make sure to authorize the necessary [scopes](/azure/devops/integrate/get-started/authentication/oauth#scopes). In this module, you can use **Full access**, but in a real-world situation, you should ensure you grant only the necessary scopes.

1. Enter your Azure DevOps organization name, then press **Enter**.

1. If prompted, enter your Azure DevOps PAT, then press **Enter**.

1. Enter a project name such as *Space Game - web - Release*, then press **Enter**.

1. Once your project is created, go to your Azure DevOps organization in your browser (at `https://dev.azure.com/<your-organization-name>/`) and select the project.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The [Clean up your Azure DevOps environment](/training/modules/create-release-pipeline/8-clean-up-environment?azure-portal=true) page in this module contains important cleanup steps. Cleaning up helps ensure that you don't run out of free build minutes. Be sure to perform the cleanup steps even if you don't complete this module.

## Prepare Visual Studio Code

Set up Visual Studio Code so you can build the website locally and use the source files.

Visual Studio Code comes with an integrated terminal so you can edit files and work from the command line, all from one place.

1. Start Visual Studio Code.
1. Select **Terminal**, and then select **New Terminal**.
1. In the dropdown list, select **Git bash**. If you're familiar with another Unix shell that you prefer to use, such as Zsh, select that shell instead. Git for Windows provides Git Bash, which makes it easy to run Git commands.

    [!include[](../../shared/includes/troubleshoot-code-terminal.md)]

1. Run the following command to navigate to your *home* directory.

    ```bash
    cd ~
    ```

### Configure Git

If you're new to Git and GitHub, you'll first need to run a few commands to associate your identity with Git and authenticate with GitHub. For more information, see [Set up Git](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git?azure-portal=true).

At a minimum, you'll need to complete the following steps:

1. [Download and install the latest version of Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
1. [Set your username](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/setting-your-username-in-git).
1. [Set your commit email address](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-email-preferences/setting-your-commit-email-address).

> [!NOTE]
> If you're already using two-factor authentication with GitHub, [create a personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token). Use your token in place of your password when you're prompted later.
>
> Treat your access token like you would treat a password. Keep it in a safe place.

## Set up your project in Visual Studio Code

 When you ran the template to set up your Azure DevOps project, the process forked the [mslearn-tailspin-spacegame-web-deploy](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/mslearn-tailspin-spacegame-web-deploy) repository automatically for you. Now you'll download, or *clone*, a copy to your computer so you can work with it.

### Clone your fork locally

1. On [GitHub](https://github.com?azure-portal=true), go to your fork of the *Space Game* web project (**mslearn-tailspin-spacegame-web-deploy**).

1. Select **Code**, and then, from the **HTTPS** tab, select the copy button to copy the URL to your clipboard.

    :::image type="content" source="../../shared/media/github-clone-button.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows how to locate the URL and copy button from the GitHub repository.":::

1. In Visual Studio Code, go to the terminal window you opened earlier.

1. Run the `git clone` command. Replace the URL that's shown here with the contents of your clipboard:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-name/mslearn-tailspin-spacegame-web-deploy.git
    ```

1. Move to the *mslearn-tailspin-spacegame-web-deploy* directory. This directory is the root of your repository.

    ```bash
    cd mslearn-tailspin-spacegame-web-deploy
    ```

### Set the upstream remote

A *remote* is a Git repository where team members collaborate (like a repository on GitHub). Here you list your remotes and add a remote that points to Microsoft's copy of the repository so that you can get the latest sample code.

1. Run the following command to list your remotes:

    ```bash
    git remote -v
    ```

    You see that you have both fetch (download) and push (upload) access to your repository:

    ```output
    origin  https://github.com/username/mslearn-tailspin-spacegame-web-deploy.git (fetch)
    origin  https://github.com/username/mslearn-tailspin-spacegame-web-deploy.git (push)
    ```

    *Origin* specifies your repository on GitHub. When you fork code from another repository, the original remote (the one you forked from) is commonly named *upstream*.

1. Run the following command to create a remote named *upstream* that points to the Microsoft repository:

    ```bash
    git remote add upstream https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/mslearn-tailspin-spacegame-web-deploy.git
    ```

1. Run `git remote` a second time to see the changes:

    ```bash
    git remote -v
    ```

    You see that you still have both fetch (download) and push (upload) access to your repository. You also now have fetch access from the Microsoft repository:

    ```output
    origin  https://github.com/username/mslearn-tailspin-spacegame-web-deploy.git (fetch)
    origin  https://github.com/username/mslearn-tailspin-spacegame-web-deploy.git (push)
    upstream        https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/mslearn-tailspin-spacegame-web-deploy.git (fetch)
    upstream        https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/mslearn-tailspin-spacegame-web-deploy.git (push)
    ```

### Open the project in Visual Studio Code

1. Run the following command from the root directory of your project.

    ```bash
    code .
    ```

1. Reopen the integrated terminal. The terminal places you at the root of your web project.

If the `code` command fails, you need to add Visual Studio Code to your system PATH. To do so:

1. In Visual Studio Code, select <kbd>F1</kbd> or select **View** > **Command Palette** to access the command palette.
1. Type *shell command* and find the **Shell Command: Install 'code' command in PATH** command.
1. Restart the terminal for the new *PATH* to take effect.

You're now set up to work with the *Space Game* source code and your Azure Pipelines configuration from your local development environment.

### Fetch the branch from GitHub

1. In Visual Studio Code, open the integrated terminal.

1. Run the following commands to fetch the *release-pipeline* branch from the MicrosoftDocs repository, and check out a new branch *upstream/release-pipeline*.

    ```bash
    git fetch upstream release-pipeline
    git checkout -B release-pipeline upstream/release-pipeline
    ```

1. As an optional step, in Visual Studio Code, open the *azure-pipelines.yml* file and familiarize yourself with the initial YAML pipeline configuration.

## Run the pipeline

At this point, you have:

* A fork of the **mslearn-tailspin-spacegame-web-deploy** repository in your GitHub account.
* The **mslearn-tailspin-spacegame-web-deploy** repository cloned locally.
* A branch named *release-pipeline* that contains the web site source code and an initial Azure Pipelines configuration.

Next, you'll manually trigger the pipeline to run. This step ensures that your project is set up to build from your GitHub repository. The initial pipeline configuration builds the application and produces a builds artifact.

1. Navigate to your project in Azure Devops, and then select **Pipelines**.

1. Select the **mslearn-tailspin-spacegame-web-deploy** pipeline. If prompted, make sure you select **Authorize resources** to authorize the service connection.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/4-pipeline-no-runs.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Azure Pipelines showing the pipeline for this project. The pipeline has no runs.":::

1. Select **Run pipeline**, and then select the *release-pipeline* branch from the **Branch/tag** dropdown menu. Select **Run**.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/4-pipeline-run-first.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Azure Pipelines showing the location of the Run pipeline button.":::

1. In the **Summary** page, select your pipeline job to view the logs.

    :::image type="content" source="../../shared/media/pipeline-trace-build.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Azure Pipelines showing the running job.":::

1. After the build finishes, select the back button to return to the summary page.

    :::image type="content" source="../../shared/media/pipeline-navigate-pipeline-summary.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Azure Pipelines showing how to navigate to the summary page.":::

1. Select your published artifact.

    :::image type="content" source="../../shared/media/pipeline-navigate-published-artifact.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Azure Pipelines showing the location of the link to the published artifact.":::

1. The *Tailspin.Space.Game.Web.zip* is your build artifact. This file contains your built application and its dependencies.

    :::image type="content" source="../../shared/media/pipeline-view-published-artifact.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Azure Pipelines showing the published artifact. The artifact includes a .zip file.":::

You now have a build pipeline for the Space Game web project. Next, you'll add a deployment stage to deploy your build artifact to Azure App Service.
