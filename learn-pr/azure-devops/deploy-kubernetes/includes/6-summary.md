Great work! In this module, you updated a release pipeline to build, publish, and deploy the team's multi-container solution to Azure Kubernetes Service. The team is now well on its way to implementing a broader microservices strategy that offers increased agility in its development and operations.

While this module focused on orchestrating a collection of Docker containers using Kubernetes, the fundamentals covered apply across a wide range of build and deployment targets. You can also see how Azure Pipelines can scale to support even the most sophisticated scenarios.

## Learn more

In this module, you worked with a microservices solution using containers. However, there are many ways to implement microservice solutions in Azure using a wide variety of technologies. To learn more, see [Building microservices on Azure](/azure/architecture/microservices/?azure-portal=true).

The microservices solution in this module had been refactored from a larger monolithic application. To learn more about migrating larger applications into smaller services, see [Decompose a monolithic application into a microservices architecture](/training/modules/microservices-architecture/?azure-portal=true).

The microservices solution in this module used various platforms and services, including Docker, Azure Container Registry, and Kubernetes. To learn more about these and related container-centric technologies in Azure, such as Azure Container Instances and App Service, see the [Administer containers in Azure learning path](../../../paths/administer-containers-in-azure/index.yml?azure-portal=true).

## Learning path summary

Congratulations. You completed the final module in the _Deploy applications with Azure DevOps_ learning path. The main focus of this learning path is deploying applications by using Azure Pipelines.

In this learning path, you accomplished a lot, including:

* Building a basic release pipeline that deploys a web application to App Service.
* Expanding your basic release pipeline to a multistage pipeline that deploys to various development, test, and staging environments.
* Running both functional and nonfunctional tests in the pipeline.
* Implementing a blue-green deployment that updates the application and requires minimal downtime.
* Extending pipelines to add support for different deployment targets, such as Azure Functions and Kubernetes.

You can apply what you learned to the applications and services that you work on.
