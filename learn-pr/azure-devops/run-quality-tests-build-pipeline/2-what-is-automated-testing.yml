  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "According to the _test pyramid_, where should you spend most of your time running tests?"
    choices:
    - content: "Running unit tests on your classes and methods."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "When you verify that each lower-level component works as expected in isolation, you can spend less time at the higher levels."
    - content: "Running integration tests between your web server and your database."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Typically, you'll spend most of your time testing lower-level components, such as functions, classes, and methods."
    - content: "Running manual tests on your user interface."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The test pyramid suggests that most of your time should be spent testing lower-level components, such as functions, classes, and methods. Manual testing might come last, after the components are known to function correctly together."
  - content: "_Shifting left_ refers to:"
    choices:
    - content: "Fixing all known bugs before adding new features."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Shifting left refers to _when_ testing occurs rather than _what kind_ of work is done."
    - content: "Considering software quality and testing earlier in the development process."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "By shifting left, you can discover and fix issues before those issues reach anyone else."
    - content: "Testing for undiscovered bugs in a test or pre-production environment."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Although this might be a good practice to follow, shifting left relates to running tests early in the development process."
  - content: "Which of the following demonstrates the best testing practices?"
    choices:
    - content: "Tests run quickly and focus on the most-used code paths."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Tests should complete quickly. Focusing on hottest code paths helps ensure that your tests cover what's important."
    - content: "A comprehensive suite of unit and integration tests is run during each stage of the build process."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Tests should complete as quickly as possible, especially those that happen during the development and build phases."
    - content: "Tests cover both the team's application code and all open-source libraries the application uses."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Typically, your tests should cover only your code."
