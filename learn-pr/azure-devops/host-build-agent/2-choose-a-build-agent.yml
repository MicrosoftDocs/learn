quiz:
  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "Let's say you're building a video game. The build process takes two hours to run and uses 18 GB to 20 GB of disk space to compile the game assets. What kind of build agent might you use?"
    choices:
    - content: "A Microsoft-hosted agent"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Although the build is completed within the allowed time, a Microsoft-hosted agent might not provide enough disk space for your build."
    - content: "A self-hosted agent"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Although the build is completed within the allowed time, you might need a self-hosted agent to accommodate the amount of disk space that your build requires."
  - content: "Let's say you're building an application that runs on macOS, Linux, and Windows. How might you build the app for each platform you target?"
    choices:
    - content: "Create a build pipeline for each platform."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Although you can create multiple build pipelines, it's easier to configure the pipeline to build the app on multiple platforms."
    - content: "Configure one pipeline to build on each platform."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "You can configure the pipeline to build on multiple platforms."
    - content: "Build for one platform and trust that the results run on all platforms."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "You can't always deploy a build for one platform to another platform. You also miss the opportunity to run quality tests on each platform you support."
  - content: "A self-hosted build agent:"
    choices:
    - content: "Must run on Azure."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "In this module, you bring up a self-hosted agent on Azure. But you can run your build agent almost anywhere."
    - content: "Can run anywhere, including Azure, another cloud, or on-premises."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "You can run a self-hosted agent anywhere. The agent must meet the requirements and be able to connect to Azure Pipelines."
    - content: "Must run on Linux. Use a Microsoft-hosted agent to build Windows applications."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "A self-hosted agent can run on Linux, macOS, or Windows."
