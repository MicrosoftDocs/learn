  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "What's the easiest way to get the IP address of a virtual machine after Terraform runs?"
    choices:
    - content: "Run the `az vm list` command and query the IP address."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Although you could run an Azure CLI command after Terraform runs, is there a way that's built-in to Terraform?"
    - content: "Run the `grep` utility to search the output for the IP address."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Although you could search the output for the information you need, is there a way that's built-in to Terraform?"
    - content: "Define an output value that retrieves the IP address."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "An output value enables you to fetch output values after Terraform runs. This includes a dynamically generated value, such as an IP address."
  - content: "Say you've made a change to your Terraform plan. What's the safest way to understand the effects of your changes before you apply them?"
    choices:
    - content: "Run `terraform init`."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The `terraform init` command initializes your Terraform environment. It does not provide information about your plan."
    - content: "Run `terraform plan`."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "The `terraform plan` command produces an execution plan that's based on your configuration. It helps you visualize and understand the affect your plan will have."
    - content: "Run `terraform apply`."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Although you can run the `terraform apply` command to review your execution plan before you apply it, is there a safer way that ensures that your plan is not yet run until you approve it?"
