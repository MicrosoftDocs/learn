    - content: "Run the `az vm list` command and query the IP address."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Although you can run an Azure CLI command after Terraform runs, is there a way that's built in to Terraform?"
    - content: "Run the `grep` tool to search the output for the IP address."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Although you can search the output for the information that you need, is there a way that's built in to Terraform?"
    - content: "Define an output value that retrieves the IP address."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "An output value enables you to fetch output values after Terraform runs. This includes a dynamically generated value, such as an IP address."
  - content: "Say you've made a change to your Terraform plan. What's the safest way to understand the effects of your change before you apply it?"
    choices:
    - content: "Run `terraform init`."

    - content: "Run `terraform plan`."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "The `terraform plan` command produces an execution plan that's based on your configuration. It helps you visualize and understand the effect that your plan will have."
    - content: "Run `terraform apply`."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Although you can run the `terraform apply` command to review your execution plan before you apply it, is there a safer way to ensure that your plan isn't run until you approve it?"
