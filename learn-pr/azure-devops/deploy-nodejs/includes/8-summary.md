Great work! In this module, you built a CI/CD pipeline in Azure Pipelines that deploys a Node.js application to Azure. The pipeline automatically runs whenever you merge a change to the `main` branch of your Git repository on GitHub.

While this module focused on a Node.js app deployed to Azure App Service, the fundamentals you covered here apply across a wide range of build and deployment targets. You can also see how Azure Pipelines can scale to support your specific requirements.

## Learn more

In this module, you worked with Node.js, which is just one of the many platforms Azure supports. To learn about support and tutorials for other development platforms, see [Build applications with Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/developer/?azure-portal=true).

In addition to supporting multiple platforms, Azure also provides various resources that can be used from Node.js applications. For an example that uses Visual Studio Code and Azure Cosmos DB, see [Build a Node.js app for Azure Cosmos DB in Visual Studio Code](/training/modules/build-node-cosmos-app-vscode/?azure-portal=true).
