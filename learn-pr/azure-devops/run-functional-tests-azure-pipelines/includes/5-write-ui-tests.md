In this section, you help Andy and Amita write Selenium tests that verify the UI behaviors that Amita described.

Amita normally runs tests on Chrome, Firefox, and Microsoft Edge. Here, you do the same. The Microsoft-hosted agent that you use is preconfigured to work with each of these browsers.

## Fetch the branch from GitHub

In this section, you fetch the `selenium` branch from GitHub. You then check out, or switch to, that branch. The contents of the branch will help you follow along with the tests that Andy and Amita write.

This branch contains the _Space Game_ project that you worked with in previous modules. It also contains an Azure Pipelines configuration to start with.

1. In Visual Studio Code, open the integrated terminal.
1. To download a branch named `selenium` from the Microsoft repository, switch to that branch, and run the following `git fetch` and `git checkout` commands:

    ```bash
    git fetch upstream selenium
    git checkout -B selenium upstream/selenium
    ```

   > [!TIP]
   > If you followed along with Amita's manual test in the previous unit, you may have run these commands already. If you already ran them in the previous unit, you can still run them again now.

    Recall that *upstream* refers to the Microsoft GitHub repository. Your project's Git configuration understands the upstream remote because you set up that relationship. You set it up when you forked the project from the Microsoft repository and cloned it locally.

    Shortly, you'll push this branch up to your GitHub repository, known as `origin`.

1. Optionally, in Visual Studio Code, open the *azure-pipelines.yml* file. Familiarize yourself with the initial configuration.

    The configuration resembles the ones that you created in the previous modules in this learning path. It builds only the application's Release configuration. For brevity, it also omits the triggers, manual approvals, and tests that you set up in previous modules.

## Write the unit test code

Amita is excited to learn to write code that controls the web browser.

She and Andy work together to write the Selenium tests. Andy has already set up an empty NUnit project. Throughout the process, they refer to the Selenium documentation, a few online tutorials, and the notes that they took when Amita did the tests manually. At the end of this module, you'll find more resources to help get you through the process.

Let's review the process that Andy and Amita use to write their tests. You can follow along by opening *HomePageTest.cs* in the *Tailspin.SpaceGame.Web.UITests* directory in Visual Studio Code.

### Define the HomePageTest class

**Andy:** The first thing we need to do is define our test class. We can choose to follow one of several naming conventions. Let's call our class `HomePageTest`. In this class, we'll put all of our tests that relate to the home page.

Andy adds this code to *HomePageTest.cs*:

```cs
public class HomePageTest
{
}
```

**Andy:** We need to mark this class as `public` so that it's available to the NUnit framework.

### Add the IWebDriver member variable

**Andy:** Next, we need an `IWebDriver` member variable. `IWebDriver` is the programming interface that you use to launch a web browser and interact with webpage content.

**Amita:** I've heard of interfaces in programming. Can you tell me more?

**Andy:** Think of an interface as a specification or blueprint for how a component should behave. An interface provides the methods, or behaviors, of that component. But the interface doesn't provide any of the underlying details. You or someone else would create one or more _concrete classes_ that implement that interface. Selenium provides the concrete classes that we need.

This diagram shows the `IWebDriver` interface and a few of the classes that implement this interface:

:::image type="content" source="../media/5-selenium-webdriver.png" alt-text="Diagram of the IWebDriver interface, its methods, and concrete classes.":::

The diagram shows three of the methods that `IWebDriver` provides: `Navigate`, `FindElement`, and `Close`.

The three classes shown here—`ChromeDriver`, `FirefoxDriver`, and `EdgeDriver`—each implement `IWebDriver` and its methods. There are other classes, such as `SafariDriver`, that also implement `IWebDriver`. Each driver class can control the web browser that it represents.

Andy adds a member variable named `driver` to the `HomePageTest` class, like this code:

```cs
public class HomePageTest
{
    private IWebDriver driver;
}
```

### Define the test fixtures

**Andy:** We want to run the entire set of tests on Chrome, Firefox, and Edge. In NUnit, we can use _test fixtures_ to run the entire set of tests multiple times, one time for each browser that we want to test on.

In NUnit, you use the `TestFixture` attribute to define your test fixtures. Andy adds these three test fixtures to the `HomePageTest` class:

```cs
[TestFixture("Chrome")]
[TestFixture("Firefox")]
[TestFixture("Edge")]
public class HomePageTest
{
    private IWebDriver driver;
}
```

**Andy:** Next, we need to define a constructor for our test class. The constructor is called when NUnit creates an instance of this class. As its argument, the constructor takes the string that we attached to our test fixtures. Here's what the code looks like:

```cs
[TestFixture("Chrome")]
[TestFixture("Firefox")]
[TestFixture("Edge")]
public class HomePageTest
{
    private string browser;
    private IWebDriver driver;

    public HomePageTest(string browser)
    {
        this.browser = browser;
    }
}
```

**Andy:** We added the `browser` member variable so that we can use the current browser name in our setup code. Let's write the setup code next.

### Define the Setup method

**Andy:** Next, we need to assign our `IWebDriver` member variable to a class instance that implements this interface for the browser we're testing on. The `ChromeDriver`, `FirefoxDriver`, and `EdgeDriver` classes implement this interface for Chrome, Firefox, and Edge, respectively.

Let's create a method named `Setup` that sets the `driver` variable. We use the `OneTimeSetUp` attribute to tell NUnit to run this method one time per test fixture.

```cs
[OneTimeSetUp]
public void Setup()
{
}
```

In the `Setup` method, we can use a `switch` statement to assign the `driver` member variable to the appropriate concrete implementation based on the browser name. Let's add that code now.

```cs
// Create the driver for the current browser.
switch(browser)
{
    case "Chrome":
    driver = new ChromeDriver(
        Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("ChromeWebDriver")
    );
    break;
    case "Firefox":
    driver = new FirefoxDriver(
        Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("GeckoWebDriver")
    );
    break;
    case "Edge":
    driver = new EdgeDriver(
        Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("EdgeWebDriver"),
        new EdgeOptions
        {
            UseChromium = true
        }
    );
    break;
    default:
    throw new ArgumentException($"'{browser}': Unknown browser");
}
```

The constructor for each driver class takes an optional path to the driver software Selenium needs to control the web browser. Later, we'll discuss the role of the environment variables shown here.

In this example, the `EdgeDriver` constructor also requires additional options to specify that we want to use the Chromium version of Edge.

### Define the helper methods

**Andy:** I know we'll need to repeat two actions throughout the tests:

* Finding elements on the page, such as the links that we click and the modal windows that we expect to appear
* Clicking elements on the page, such as the links that reveal the modal windows and the button that closes each modal

Let's write two helper methods, one for each action. We'll start with the method that finds an element on the page.

#### Write the FindElement helper method

When you locate an element on the page, it's typically in response to some other event, such as the page loading or the user entering information. Selenium provides the `WebDriverWait` class, which allows you to wait for a condition to be true. If the condition isn't true within the given time period, `WebDriverWait` throws an exception or error. We can use the `WebDriverWait` class to wait for a given element to be displayed and to be ready to receive user input.

To locate an element on the page, use the `By` class. The `By` class provides methods that let you find an element by its name, by its CSS class name, by its HTML tag, or in our case, by its `id` attribute.

Andy and Amita code up the `FindElement` helper method. It looks like this code:

```cs
private IWebElement FindElement(By locator, IWebElement parent = null, int timeoutSeconds = 10)
{
    // WebDriverWait enables us to wait for the specified condition to be true
    // within a given time period.
    return new WebDriverWait(driver, TimeSpan.FromSeconds(timeoutSeconds))
        .Until(c => {
            IWebElement element = null;
            // If a parent was provided, find its child element.
            if (parent != null)
            {
                element = parent.FindElement(locator);
            }
            // Otherwise, locate the element from the root of the DOM.
            else
            {
                element = driver.FindElement(locator);
            }
            // Return true after the element is displayed and is able to receive user input.
            return (element != null && element.Displayed && element.Enabled) ? element : null;
        });
}
```

#### Write the ClickElement helper method

**Andy:** Next, let's write a helper method that clicks links. Selenium provides a few ways to write that method. One of them is the `IJavaScriptExecutor` interface. With it, we can programmatically click links by using JavaScript. This approach works well because it can click links without first scrolling them into view.

`ChromeDriver`, `FirefoxDriver`, and `EdgeDriver` each implement `IJavaScriptExecutor`. We need to cast the driver to this interface and then call `ExecuteScript` to run the JavaScript `click()` method on the underlying HTML object.

Andy and Amita code up the `ClickElement` helper method. It looks like this code:

```cs
private void ClickElement(IWebElement element)
{
    // We expect the driver to implement IJavaScriptExecutor.
    // IJavaScriptExecutor enables us to execute JavaScript code during the tests.
    IJavaScriptExecutor js = driver as IJavaScriptExecutor;

    // Through JavaScript, run the click() method on the underlying HTML object.
    js.ExecuteScript("arguments[0].click();", element);
}
```

**Amita:** I like the idea of adding these helper methods. They seem general enough to use in almost any test. We can add more helper methods later as we need them.

### Define the test method

**Andy:** Now, we're ready to define the test method. Based on the manual tests that we ran earlier, let's call this method `ClickLinkById_ShouldDisplayModalById`. It's a good practice to give test methods descriptive names that define precisely what the test accomplishes. Here, we want to select a link defined by its `id` attribute. Then we want to verify that the proper modal window appears, also by using its `id` attribute.

Andy adds starter code for the test method:

```cs
public void ClickLinkById_ShouldDisplayModalById(string linkId, string modalId)
{
}
```

**Andy:** Before we add more code, let's define what this test should do.

**Amita:** I can handle this part. We want to:

1. Locate the link by its `id` attribute and select the link.
1. Locate the resulting modal.
1. Close the modal.
1. Verify that the modal was displayed successfully.

**Andy:** Great. We'll also need to handle a few other things. For example, we need to ignore the test if the driver couldn't be loaded, and we need to close the modal only if the modal was successfully displayed.

After refilling their coffee mugs, Andy and Amita add code to their test method. They use the helper methods that they wrote to locate page elements and click links and buttons. Here's the result:

```cs
public void ClickLinkById_ShouldDisplayModalById(string linkId, string modalId)
{
    // Skip the test if the driver could not be loaded.
    // This happens when the underlying browser is not installed.
    if (driver == null)
    {
        Assert.Ignore();
        return;
    }

    // Locate the link by its ID and then click the link.
    ClickElement(FindElement(By.Id(linkId)));

    // Locate the resulting modal.
    IWebElement modal = FindElement(By.Id(modalId));

    // Record whether the modal was successfully displayed.
    bool modalWasDisplayed = (modal != null && modal.Displayed);

    // Close the modal if it was displayed.
    if (modalWasDisplayed)
    {
        // Click the close button that's part of the modal.
        ClickElement(FindElement(By.ClassName("close"), modal));

        // Wait for the modal to close and for the main page to again be clickable.
        FindElement(By.TagName("body"));
    }

    // Assert that the modal was displayed successfully.
    // If it wasn't, this test will be recorded as failed.
    Assert.That(modalWasDisplayed, Is.True);
}
```

**Amita:** The coding looks great so far, but how do we connect this test to the `id` attributes that we collected earlier?

**Andy:** Great question. We'll handle that next.

### Define test case data

**Andy:** In NUnit, you can provide data to your tests in a few ways. Here, we use the `TestCase` attribute. This attribute takes arguments that it later passes back to the test method when it runs. We can have multiple `TestCase` attributes that each test a different feature of our app. Each `TestCase` attribute produces a test case that's included in the report that appears at the end of a pipeline run.

Andy adds these `TestCase` attributes to the test method. These attributes describe the **Download game** button, one of the game screens, and the top player on the leaderboard. Each attribute specifies two `id` attributes: one for the link to select and one for the corresponding modal window.

```cs
// Download game
[TestCase("download-btn", "pretend-modal")]
// Screen image
[TestCase("screen-01", "screen-modal")]
// // Top player on the leaderboard
[TestCase("profile-1", "profile-modal-1")]
public void ClickLinkById_ShouldDisplayModalById(string linkId, string modalId)
{

...
```

**Andy:** For each `TestCase` attribute, the first parameter is the `id` attribute for the link to select. The second parameter is the `id` attribute for the modal window that we expect to appear. You can see how these parameters correspond to the two-string arguments in our test method.

**Amita:** I do see that. With some practice, I think I can add my own tests. When can we see these tests running in our pipeline?

**Andy:** Before we push changes through the pipeline, let's first verify that the code compiles and runs locally. We'll commit and push changes to GitHub and see them move through the pipeline only after we verify that everything works. Let's run the tests locally now.
