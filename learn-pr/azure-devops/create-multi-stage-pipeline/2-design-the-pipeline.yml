  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "Your pipeline includes many tests and quality checks that take several minutes to finish. Which kind of trigger is best for running tests only on code that a peer has reviewed?"
    choices:
    - content: "A build completion trigger"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "A build completion trigger runs a build when another build, such as one for a dependent component, finishes successfully."
    - content: "A CI trigger or PR trigger"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Use CI and PR triggers to control which branches participate in the overall process. You can use them to run your pipeline only during a pull request or after a pull request is merged into a certain branch, such as `main` or a release branch."
    - content: "A scheduled trigger"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Although you can use a scheduled trigger to run tests regularly, is there a better way to run tests only when they're needed?"
  - content: "What's the best way to pause the pipeline until an approver signs off on a change?"
    choices:
    - content: "Use a release approval."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "A release approval pauses the pipeline until an approver accepts or rejects the release."
    - content: "Install a Marketplace extension that provides Azure Pipelines tasks that can pause the pipeline."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Although you might find an extension that can fulfill your need, can you use a built-in mechanism instead?"
    - content: "Ask your approver to look at the change. Then manually trigger the pipeline to run."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Is there an automated way to allow the approver to see the working software and then promote it to the next stage?"
  - content: "You want to deploy your web app to the _Test_ environment each time a build finishes. What's the easiest way to set up the process?"
    choices:
    - content: "Use a scheduled trigger."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Although a scheduled trigger enables you to build your web app and pick up the latest dependencies on a regular schedule, it doesn't trigger your pipeline to run when a build finishes."
    - content: "Watch for build notification emails and manually trigger your build when the other one finishes successfully."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This method is inefficient. Is there a way to trigger the build automatically?"
    - content: "Use a build completion trigger."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "A build completion trigger runs a build when another build, such as one for a dependent component, finishes successfully."
