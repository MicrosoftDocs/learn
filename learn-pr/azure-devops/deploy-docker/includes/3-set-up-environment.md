In this section, you'll lean how to set up your Azure DevOps organization and create the Azure App Service environment that you'll deploy to.

You'll learn how to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Set up your Azure DevOps project.
> * Manage your work items with Azure Boards.
> * Create your Azure App Service environment.
> * Create pipeline variables in Azure Pipelines.
> * Create a service connection to authenticate with your Azure subscription.

## Add a user to Azure DevOps

To complete this module, you need your own [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?azure-portal=true). You can get started with Azure for free.

You don't need an Azure subscription to work with Azure DevOps, but in this module you'll use Azure DevOps to deploy to Azure resources. To simplify the process, use the same Microsoft account to sign in to both Azure and Azure DevOps.

If you use different Microsoft accounts to sign in to Azure and Azure DevOps, add a user with **Basic** access level to your DevOps organization under the Microsoft account that you use to sign in to Azure. See [Add users to your organization or project](/azure/devops/organizations/accounts/add-organization-users?azure-portal=true&tabs=browser) for more details.

Then, sign out of Azure DevOps and sign back in using the same account you used to sign in to your Azure subscription.

## Get the Azure DevOps project

Here, you'll ensure that your Azure DevOps organization is set up to complete the rest of this module. To do so, you'll run a template that creates a project in Azure DevOps.

The modules in this learning path form a progression. You follow the Tailspin web team through their DevOps journey. For learning purposes, each module has its own Azure DevOps project.

### Run the template

Run a template that sets up your Azure DevOps organization:

> [!div class="nextstepaction"]
> [Run the template](https://azuredevopsdemogenerator.azurewebsites.net/?x-ms-routing-name=self&name=DeployDockercontainers&azure-portal=true)

From the Azure DevOps Demo Generator site, follow these steps to run the template:

1. Select **Sign In** and accept the usage terms.

1. On the **Create New Project** page, select your Azure DevOps organization. Enter a project name such as *Space Game - web - Docker*.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/3-create-new-project.png" alt-text="Screenshot of creating a project through Azure DevOps Demo Generator.":::

1. Select **Yes, I want to fork this repository** > **Authorize**. If prompted, authorize access to your GitHub account.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > You need to select this option so the template can connect to your GitHub repository. Make sure to select the checkbox even if you've already forked the *Space Game* repository. The template will use your existing fork.

1. Select **Create Project**.

1. Select **Navigate to project** to go to your project in Azure DevOps.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In this module, the [Clean up your Azure DevOps environment](/training/modules/deploy-docker/5-clean-up-environment?azure-portal=true) page contains important cleanup steps. Cleaning up helps ensure that you don't run out of free build minutes. Be sure to follow the cleanup steps even if you don't complete this module.

[!include[](../../shared/includes/project-visibility.md)]

## Move the work item to Doing

Here, you'll assign a work item to yourself on Azure Boards. You'll also move the work item to the **Doing** state. In practice, you and your team would create work items at the start of each *sprint*, or work iteration.

This work assignment gives you a checklist to work from. It gives other team members visibility into what you're working on and how much work is left. The work item also helps enforce work-in-progress (WIP) limits so that the team doesn't take on too much work at one time.

Here, you'll move the first item, **Create container version of web site using Docker**, to the **Doing** column, then assign yourself to the work item.

To set up the work item:

1. From Azure DevOps, navigate to **Boards**. Then select **Boards** from the menu.

    :::image type="content" source="../../shared/media/azure-devops-boards-menu.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Azure DevOps showing the location of the Boards menu.":::

1. In the **Create container version of web site using Docker** work item, select the down arrow at the bottom of the card, then assign the work item to yourself.

    :::image type="content" source="../../shared/media/azure-boards-down-chevron.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Azure Boards showing the location of the down arrow.":::

1. Move the work item from the **To Do** column to the **Doing** column.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/3-azure-boards-wi1-doing.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Azure Boards showing the card in the Doing column.":::

At the end of this module, you'll move the card to the **Done** column after you complete the task.

## Create the Azure App Service environment

In the [Create a release pipeline with Azure Pipelines](/training/modules/create-release-pipeline?azure-portal=true) module, you created an App Service instance using Azure portal. Although the portal is an excellent tool for exploring Azure's offerings, setting up components like App Service can become cumbersome.

In this module, you'll employ the Azure CLI to launch the resources necessary for deploying and running an App Service instance. You can access the Azure CLI from a terminal or through Visual Studio Code.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You must have your own Azure subscription to complete the exercises in this module.

### Launch Cloud Shell inn Azure portal

1. Navigate to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com?azure-portal=true) and sign in.

1. Select the **Cloud Shell** from the menu bar, and then select the **Bash** experience.

    :::image type="content" source="../../shared/media/azure-portal-menu-cloud-shell.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Azure portal showing the location of the Cloud Shell menu item.":::

    > [!NOTE]
    > Cloud Shell requires an Azure storage resource to persist any files that you create in Cloud Shell. When you first open Cloud Shell, you're prompted to create a resource group, storage account, and Azure Files share. This setup is automatically used for all future Cloud Shell sessions.

### Select an Azure region

A *region* is one or more Azure datacenters located within a particular geographic location. East US, West US, and North Europe are a few examples of regions. Each Azure resource, such as an App Service instance, is allocated to a specific region.

To simplify the process of running commands, begin by selecting a default region. Once the default region is specified, subsequent commands will use that region by default unless a different region is explicitly specified.

1. Run the following command to list the available regions for your Azure subscription.

    ```azurecli
    az account list-locations \
      --query "[].{Name: name, DisplayName: displayName}" \
      --output table
    ```

1. Select a region that is in proximity to your location from the *Name* column in the output. For example, you can choose *eastasia* or *westus2*.

1. Run the following command to set your default region. Replace the placeholder with the name of the region you've selected.

    ```azurecli
    az configure --defaults location=<REGION>
    ```

    This example sets *westus2* as the default region:

    ```azurecli
    az configure --defaults location=westus2
    ```

### Create Bash variables

In this section, you'll create Bash variables to make the setup process more convenient and less error-prone. Using variables for shared text strings helps avoid accidental typos.

1. From Cloud Shell, generate a random number. This will make it easier to create globally unique names for certain services in the next step.

    ```bash
    resourceSuffix=$RANDOM
    ```

1. Create globally unique names for your App Service Web App and Azure Container Registry. Using double quotes in these commands prompts Bash to interpolate the variables using the inline syntax.

    ```bash
    webName="tailspin-space-game-web-${resourceSuffix}"
    registryName="tailspinspacegame${resourceSuffix}"
    ```

1. Create two more Bash variables to store the names of your resource group and App Service plan.

    ```bash
    rgName='tailspin-space-game-rg'
    planName='tailspin-space-game-asp'
    ```

### Create the Azure resources

   > [!NOTE]
   > For learning purposes, you'll the default network settings here. These settings make your site accessible from the internet. In practice, you could configure an Azure virtual network that places your website in a network that's not internet routable and that only you and your team can access. Later, you could reconfigure your network to make the website available to your users.

1. Run the following `az group create` command to create a resource group using the name defined earlier.

    ```azurecli
    az group create --name $rgName
    ```

1. Run the following `az acr create` command to create an Azure Container Registry using the name defined earlier.

    ```azurecli
    az acr create --name $registryName \
      --resource-group $rgName \
      --sku Standard \
      --admin-enabled true
    ```

1. Run the following `az appservice plan create` command to create an App Service plan using the name defined earlier.

    ```azurecli
    az appservice plan create \
      --name $planName \
      --resource-group $rgName \
      --sku B1 \
      --is-linux
    ```

    The `--sku` argument specifies the B1 plan. This plan runs on the Basic tier. The `--is-linux` argument specifies to use Linux workers.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > If the B1 SKU isn't available in your Azure subscription, [choose a different plan](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/app-service/linux/?azure-portal=true), such as S1 (Standard).

1. Run the following `az webapp create` command to create the App Service instance.

    ```azurecli
    az webapp create \
      --name $webName \
      --resource-group $rgName \
      --plan $planName \
      --deployment-container-image-name $registryName.azurecr.io/web:latest
    ```

1. Run the following `az webapp list` command to list the host name and state of the App Service instance.

    ```azurecli
    az webapp list \
      --resource-group $rgName \
      --query "[].{hostName: defaultHostName, state: state}" \
      --output table
    ```

    Note the host name for the running service. You'll need it later when you verify your work. Here's an example:

    ```output
    HostName                                        State
    ----------------------------------------------  -------
    tailspin-space-game-web-4692.azurewebsites.net  Running
    ```

1. Run the following `az acr list` command to list the login server of the Azure Container Registry instance. You'll need this server name when creating pipeline variables later.

    ```azurecli
    az acr list \
      --resource-group $rgName \
      --query "[].{loginServer: loginServer}" \
      --output table
    ```

    Note the login server. You'll need it later when you configure the pipeline. Here's an example:

    ```output
    LoginServer
    ---------------------------------
    tailspinspacegame4692.azurecr.io    
    ```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The [Clean up your Azure DevOps environment](/training/modules/deploy-docker/5-clean-up-environment?azure-portal=true) page in this module contains important cleanup steps. Cleaning up helps ensure that you're not charged for Azure resources after you complete this module. Be sure to perform the cleanup steps even if you don't complete this module.

## Create pipeline variables in Azure Pipelines

In [Create a release pipeline with Azure Pipelines](/training/modules/create-release-pipeline?azure-portal=true), you added a variable to your pipeline that stores the name of your web app in App Service. You'll do the same thing here. In addition, you'll add the name of your Azure Container Registry.

You could hard-code these names in your pipeline configuration, but if you define them as variables, your configuration will be more reusable. Plus, if your instance names change, you can update the variables and trigger your pipeline without modifying your configuration.

To add the variables:

1. In Azure DevOps, go to your **Space Game - web - Docker** project.

1. Under **Pipelines**, select **Library**.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/3-pipelines-library.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Azure Pipelines showing the Library menu option.":::

1. Select **+ Variable group**.

1. Under **Properties**, enter *Release* for the variable group name.

1. Under **Variables**, select **+ Add**.

1. For the name of your variable, enter *WebAppName*. For the value, enter the name of the App Service instance created above, such as *tailspin-space-game-web-4692*.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > Set the name of the App Service instance, not its host name. In this example, you would enter *tailspin-space-game-web-4692* and not *tailspin-space-game-web-4692.azurewebsites.net*.

1. Repeat the process to add another variable named *RegistryName* with the value of your Azure Container Registry login server, such as *tailspinspacegame4692.azurecr.io*.

1. Select **Pipeline permissions**, and then select the `+` sign to add a pipeline. Select **mslearn-tailspin-spacegame-web-docker** to give your pipeline permission to access the variable group.

1. Select **Save** at the top of the page to save your variables. Your variable group should look like the following:

    :::image type="content" source="../media/3-library-variable-group.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Azure Pipeline showing the variable group. The group contains two variables.":::

## Create required service connections

Here, you'll create a service connection that enables Azure Pipelines to access your Azure subscription. Azure Pipelines uses this service connection to deploy the website to App Service. You created a similar service connection in the previous module. You'll also create a Docker Registry connection to publish your container to the Azure Container Registry.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Ensure that you're signed in to both the Azure portal and Azure DevOps under the same Microsoft account.

1. In Azure DevOps, go to your **Space Game - web - Docker** project.
1. From the bottom corner of the page, select **Project settings**.
1. Under **Pipelines**, select **Service connections**.
1. Select **New service connection**, then choose **Azure Resource Manager**, then select **Next**.
1. Near the top of the page, **Service principal (automatic)**. Then select **Next**.
1. Fill in these fields:

    | Field                   | Value                                      |
    |-------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
    | Scope level             | Subscription                               |
    | Subscription            | Your Azure subscription                    |
    | Resource Group          | *tailspin-space-game-rg*                   |
    | Service connection name | *Resource Manager - Tailspin - Space Game* |

    During the process, you might be prompted to sign in to your Microsoft account.

1. Ensure that **Grant access permission to all pipelines** is selected.

1. Select **Save**.

    Azure DevOps performs a test connection to verify that it can connect to your Azure subscription. If Azure DevOps can't connect, you have the chance to sign in a second time.

1. Select **New service connection**, then choose **Docker Registry**, then select **Next**.
1. Near the top of the page, select **Azure Container Registry**.
1. Fill in these fields:

    | Field                     | Value                                        |
    |---------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
    | Subscription              | Your Azure subscription                      |
    | Azure container registry  | Select the one you created earlier           |
    | Service connection name   | *Container Registry Connection*              |

1. Ensure that **Grant access permission to all pipelines** is selected.

1. Select **Save** when you're done.
