> [!NOTE]
> Keep in mind that a more robust configuration might specify the branches that participate in the build process. For example, to help verify code quality, you might run unit tests each time you push up a change on any branch. You might also deploy the application to an environment that performs more exhaustive testing, but only when you have a pull request, a release candidate, or you merge code to *master*.
