You've met the Tailspin team and learned a bit about their problems. Mara, the newest team member, is trying to convince her teammates that a DevOps approach, using the services in Azure DevOps, is a great way to solve them. She's taken it upon herself to do a *value stream mapping* (VSM) exercise, and she's shown everyone the results.

Her next goal is to convince the Tailspin team to take their first DevOps steps by using an Agile approach and Azure Boards, a part of the Azure DevOps suite. Azure Boards helps teams collaborate and plan their work better. This module shows how the team creates its first board.

In this module, you will:

- Learn how adopting an Agile mindset can help your team to better collaborate, plan, and learn.
- Create a project in Azure DevOps.
- Add work items to Azure Boards using the Basic process.

## Prerequisites

The modules in this learning path form a progression. We recommend you start at the beginning of the [Evolve your DevOps practices](/learn/paths/evolve-your-devops-practices?azure-portal=true) learning path before you work on this module.

If you'd rather do only this module, go through [Get started with Azure DevOps](/learn/modules/get-started-with-devops?azure-portal=true) first to set up your Azure DevOps organization.

## Meet the team

You met the _Space Game_ web team at Tailspin Toys in previous modules. As a refresher, here's who you'll work with in this module.
