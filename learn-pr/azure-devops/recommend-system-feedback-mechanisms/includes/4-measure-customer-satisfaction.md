## The meeting

The team is still in a meeting. Now they're trying to decide how to get data about how well the beta testers like the website.

**Andy:** I know there are a lot of approaches. I tend to think in terms of continuous feedback, which means we have built-in customer feedback loops. There are numerous ways we can make it easy for customers to tell us their reactions.

## Measure customer satisfaction

The team is trying to decide how to gauge customer satisfaction. They want data about all aspects of the user's experience, which includes the customer's interaction with the company, its services, and its products.  In other words, don't confuse UI, the user _interface_, with UX, the user _experience_.

As an analogy, consider a car. A car's external appearance, its dashboard, and its steering wheel, all define its UI. The act of driving the car is the UX. The interface directly contributes to the experience. For example, a beautiful car interior makes for a better experience of sitting in one, but it's not the experience itself.

The only real measure of software quality that matters is customer satisfaction and measuring customer satisfaction doesn't have to be complicated or expensive. In fact, it's fairly simple to incorporate customer satisfaction measurements into your existing customer success strategy.

No matter how you look at it, measuring customer satisfaction comes down to gathering customer feedback. To accurately gauge customer sentiment, you simply need to ask them about their experience. A survey is an easy way to do that.

There are many ways you can conduct a survey. When you launch your survey, the sample size you choose, and how you analyze the results are all factors you need to consider. Let's take a brief look at the five steps you can take to measure customer satisfaction.

## Step 1: Outline your goals

When you launch your campaign, take a step back and ask, "Why are we doing this?" In business, you must weigh the value of additional information, your customer satisfaction data, in relation to the cost of collecting it, which is the survey process.

## Step 2: Create a customer satisfaction survey

What types of metrics measure customer satisfaction? When you create a customer satisfaction survey, you have a few options to choose from. A few popular methods are:

* Customer Satisfaction Score (CSAT)
* Customer Effort Score (CES)
* Net Promoter Score (NPS)

Each of these methods asks just one question, which can greatly simplify the process of collecting customer insights.

While you may not think that the survey methodology matters much, how you ask the question does seem to affect what you're measuring.

For instance, a 2010 study found that 20% of _satisfied_ customers said they intended to leave the company in question, while 28% of the _dissatisfied_ customers intended to stay. In this example, "satisfied" doesn't necessarily equate to "loyal."

### CSAT

CSAT is the most commonly used satisfaction method. Here, you ask your customers to rate their satisfaction on a linear scale.

Your survey scale can be on a scale of 1–3, 1–5, or 1–10. There is no universal agreement on which scale is best. CSAT is a metric that's used to immediately evaluate a customer's specific experience.

### CES

CES is similar to CSAT, but instead of asking how satisfied the customer was, you ask them to evaluate the ease of their experience.

You still measure satisfaction, but in this way, you're gauging effort. The assumption here is that the easier it is to complete a task, the better the overall experience is for the customer. As it turns out, tasks that require little effort are some of the best ways to reduce frustration and disloyalty.

### NPS

NPS asks the question: "How likely is it that you would recommend this company to a friend or colleague?"

NPS measures not only customer satisfaction but also customer loyalty. You can come up with an aggregate score, but you can also easily segment your responses into three categories: *detractors*, *passives*, and *promoters*. You calculate NPS by subtracting the percentage of detractors from the percentage of promoters.

### Combine methods to see the bigger picture

Because each measurement provides you with different information, you can combine them.

For example, a customer that has provided three negative CSAT scores and is an NPS detractor would be an immediate at-risk customer, while a customer who provided positive CSAT scores and is an NPS promoter is potentially the best person to advocate your product to others.

### Ask a qualitative question to gain additional insight

Your survey can also include a qualitative, open-ended question. Without an open-ended question, you risk limiting your insight into _why_ the customer answered the way they did. Qualitative user feedback can give you additional insight when it comes time to implement solutions.

## Step 3: Choose a time to launch your survey

This step is all about selecting who you send the survey to and when you send it. If you look back at your goals, this shouldn't be too hard to determine, at least strategically.

People tend to forget this step, but selecting your sample and your timing can affect the quality and usefulness of the data you collect.

Although there is no "one size fits all" approach to customer satisfaction surveys, there are three questions that you should consider before you launch your survey:

* What event or action took place before you asked for feedback?
* How much time elapsed since your last survey?
* What is your team's ability to reply to feedback in a timely manner?

You can use an automated process to launch your survey to each customer after they complete a task or after an event takes place. Some examples of these tasks or events are:

* Time since signup.
* Key actions taken in your application.
* Completion of onboarding.

Surveys too often result in low response rates. We recommend an NPS survey seven days after signup, 30 days after the first survey, and every 90 days during the customer lifecycle.

With these options in mind, let's look at some recommended practices:

* The closer the survey is to the experience, the better.

    The longer you wait, the more people forget about how they felt.
* Who you survey changes what insights you get.

    When you survey customers anonymously, for example, through a control on your website, you're likely to get different data than you would from a less anonymous method, such as email.

* Survey your customers more than once to see how things change over time.

    If you operate SaaS or a subscription service, regular NPS surveys can help you analyze trends both at the aggregate level and at the individual level.

* Survey people after a key moment of their customer journey.

    If a respondent gives you a high score, think about adding a follow-up survey. For instance, you might follow up by asking your most satisfied users to rate your mobile app in the app store.

## Step 4: Analyze your survey data

After you collect your data, make sure it doesn't just sit there dormant and unused. You've got all this customer insight, and it's just waiting to be uncovered!

## Step 5: Make adjustments and repeat

Now that you have these insights, what are you going to do about it? Ultimately, this decision reflects on your own findings and capabilities. You may find that a whole segment is dissatisfied because of a particular experience. In that case, you need to investigate why that experience causes dissatisfaction and then run experiments to try to improve it. You may find that you have a small percentage of super fans. How can you get them to recommend you to others?

If you won't change anything after collecting your customer satisfaction data, you're better off not collecting it. It's going to take time and effort, so you need to put it to good use.

Depending on your business or organizational capabilities, there's a lot you can do with customer satisfaction data. One use is simply to make you aware of the reality of your business. A portion of your customers is going to have an unsatisfactory experience. Every business faces this problem.

After you understand user sentiment, you can choose from many courses of action. For example, you can:

* Fix any bottlenecks that contribute to poor customer experience.
* Expedite the support process for your most frustrated customers.
* Create a knowledge base that educates your customers on how to best use your software.
* Try new support strategies, such as providing a live chat option.

The specific solution isn't the focus here. The focus is to step back and ask yourself: "If we see that a segment of our customers is dissatisfied, what will we do about it?"

## What about in-product feedback?

You've likely visited a website that, after some time period, prompts you to:

* Provide feedback.
* Sign up for a free trial.
* Rate the app.
* Complete a one-question survey.
* Send a smile or frown.

These prompts are about meeting your customers where they are. When implemented correctly, in-product feedback is a fantastic way to gather relevant information from people as they use your product.

When implemented poorly, it's an effective way to drive people away from your service.

### What kind of feedback can you expect from in-product measurements?

Some of the more insightful feedback comes from people who are already using your products, who have chosen to visit your website, or who have otherwise opted-in to what you're selling. This feedback also tends to be more specific and candid.

Providing these users with a way to share feedback with you from within the context of your product makes this type of feedback especially valuable. You can use it to improve the usability of a particular feature or to recruit users who are already performing certain actions to engage more deeply.

### What are the benefits to in-product measurements?

* Feedback is tied to a specific task or feature.

    Customers are already using your product, so they can provide feedback based on their actual usage or needs at the time.

* It's always on.

    Implementing ways to provide feedback in-product makes it very easy for users to provide input, at any point, without the need to respond to a formal survey.

* You're more likely to achieve higher response rates.

    Since the feedback mechanism is built in to your services, customers have access to it if and when they need it. That could mean reporting a problem, bug, enhancement, or even a compliment.

### What are the weaknesses to in-product measurements?

* Too much feedback.

    The volume of feedback you receive can be overwhelming. If you don't have the means to review it all, you lose the opportunity to gain insights from your customers.
* Not enough detail.

    If you post surveys on your site, the information you get back from respondents may not be detailed enough to take action on.
* It limits future follow-up.

    Depending on the tools you're using to collect feedback, you may not have enough contact information to connect directly with the customer who submitted the feedback and go deeper.

### What questions should I ask?

Here are some sample questions you might consider asking:

* "What is *{product feature}* helping you accomplish?"
* "What issues are you having with *{product feature}*?"
* "What features do you think we're missing today for *{product feature}*?"

## Collect feedback on your product roadmap

One kind of feedback that we often miss from surveys is priority. Wouldn't it be great if there was a way to capture feedback and allow your customers to vote on what's most useful to them?

Effective communication on your product roadmap helps keep your customers engaged. However, by giving your users the ability to request new features, you're making users part of your product development's inner loop. This is powerful, but at the same time you run the risk of driving your product in a direction where it becomes a niche solution for only a subset of your target market. By increasing the visibility of the requested features, you can empower your entire customer base to vote on features they would like to see. This helps add an extra dimension to your planning backlog and helps you to prioritize your work.

It's been shown that increased communication with customers promotes deeper engagement. By updating supporters of an idea as it moves through different product development stages - from discovery to planning to development and launch - your customers never feel like they're in the dark.

The Azure DevOps team uses Azure Boards to publish its feature plan for the coming months. You can see their plans on [dev.azure.com](https://dev.azure.com/mseng/AzureDevOpsRoadmap/_workitems/recentlyupdated?azure-portal=true).

### Create a feature request board

Creating a _feature request board_ is a popular way to get feedback from your existing customers.

In fact, you can suggest improvements to Azure DevOps and vote on improvements that others have suggested at [developercommunity.visualstudio.com](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/topics/Azure+DevOps.html?azure-portal=true).

The [Azure DevOps Integration](https://feedback.uservoice.com/knowledgebase/articles/363410-vsts-azure-devops-integration?azure-portal=true) page on UserVoice explains how you can create your own feature board for opening the feedback channels with your customers.

### Should I publish my product roadmap?

Here are a few pros and cons you should consider before you publish your product roadmap or create a feature request board:

| Builds a sense of community and heightened loyalty when you can collaborate with the company on ideas.                                                            | Low volume unless customers are explicitly prompted to suggest an idea on the board.                                                                            |
| Provides a channel through which you can make users feel appreciated for their contributions by letting them know that you're taking action on their suggestions. |                                                                                                                                                                 |

## The decision

What does the team decide to do?

**Amita:** I've always considered making sure our customers have a great user experience to be the most important part of my job. Why don't I put together a survey, as a start. In fact, why not two? I think I'll try NPS and CSAT. We can even refine the surveys during the beta tests. We can beta test the surveys!

**Andy:** Thanks, Amita. We're really making progress.
