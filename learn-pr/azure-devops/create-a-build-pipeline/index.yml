summary: Set up a continuous integration (CI) pipeline that automates the process of building your application.
abstract: |
  After completing this module, you'll be able to:
  - Create a build pipeline in Azure Pipelines
  - Map manual build steps to automated build tasks
  - Publish your builds so others can access them
  - Use templates to build multiple configurations (optional)
prerequisites: |
  **Required knowledge and skills**:
    - Familiarity with forking and cloning a GitHub repo

  **Account requirements**:
    - An Azure DevOps organization
      - To use Microsoft-hosted agents, your Azure DevOps organization must have access to **Microsoft-hosted** parallel jobs. [Check your parallel jobs and request a free grant](/azure/devops/pipelines/troubleshooting/troubleshooting#check-for-available-parallel-jobs).
      - You can use GitHub Codespaces to complete the module, even if your Azure DevOps organization doesn't have any parallel jobs.
    - A [GitHub](https://github.com/join) account

  **Software requirements**:
    - If using GitHub Codespaces to complete the module, there are no software requirements as all software is included in the Codespace
    - If using a local development environment with Microsoft-hosted agents, you must have the following software installed:
      - [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)
      - [.NET 6.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/6.0)
      - [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
