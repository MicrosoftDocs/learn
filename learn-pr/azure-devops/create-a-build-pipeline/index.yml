  After completing this module, you'll be able to:
  - Create a build pipeline in Azure Pipelines
  - Map manual build steps to automated build tasks
  - Publish your builds so others can access them
  - Use templates to build multiple configurations
prerequisites: |
  - An Azure DevOps organization
    - To use Microsoft-hosted agents, your Azure DevOps organization must have access to **Microsoft-hosted** parallel jobs. [Check your parallel jobs and request a free grant](/azure/devops/pipelines/troubleshooting/troubleshooting#check-for-available-parallel-jobs).
    - You can use GitHub Codespaces to complete the module, even if your Azure DevOps organization doesn't have any parallel jobs.
