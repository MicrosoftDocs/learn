At this point, Mara has defined a build configuration for the *Space Game* website. Now, it's your turn; you're going to create a pipeline and produce your first build artifact.

As you saw, Mara used a YAML file to define the build. When you create a pipeline, the process prompts you for your YAML file. The project doesn't have this file yet.

When you don't provide an initial YAML file for your project, Azure Pipelines can create one for you based on your app type. Here, you'll build an ASP.NET Core app, but Azure Pipelines also provides starter build configurations for other project types, including Java, Go, and more.

## Create the pipeline

1. In Azure DevOps, go to your project.

1. Either from the project page or from the left pane, select **Pipelines**.

1. Select **Create Pipeline** (or **New pipeline** if this isn't the first pipeline in the project).

1. On the **Connect** tab, select **GitHub**.

    When prompted, enter your GitHub credentials.

1. On the **Select** tab, select your **mslearn-tailspin-spacegame-web** repository.

1. To install the Azure Pipelines app, you might be redirected to GitHub. If so, scroll to the bottom, and select **Approve & Install**.

1. On the **Configure** tab, select **ASP.NET Core**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you don't see this option, select **Show more**. Don't select **ASP.NET Core (.NET Framework)**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If your repository has an `azure-pipelines.yml` file at the root level, Azure DevOps may skip the **Configure** step. To resolve this issue, remove or rename the file.

1. On the **Review** tab, note the initial build configuration.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/6-initial-pipeline-yml.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Azure Pipelines showing the initial build configuration.":::

    This is a very basic configuration that Azure DevOps provides for you based on your app type, ASP.NET Core. The default configuration uses a Microsoft-hosted agent.

    ::: zone pivot="github-codespaces-agent"

    Replace the text `vmImage: ubuntu-latest` with `name: Default` (or the name of your agent pool if you specified a different pool when setting up the Codespaces Repository secrets).

    ::: zone-end

1. On the **Review** tab, select **Save and run**. To commit your changes to GitHub and start the pipeline, choose **Commit directly to the main branch** and select **Save and run** a second time. If you're prompted to grant permission with a message like `This pipeline needs permission to access a resource before this run can continue`, choose **View** and follow the prompts to permit access.

## Watch the pipeline run

Under **Jobs**, select **Job**. Next, trace the build process through each of the steps. To see the job output as a text file when the build completes, you can also select **View raw log**.

::: zone pivot="github-codespaces-agent"

If your pipeline doesn't start quickly, verify that Codespaces is still running. Codespaces will shut down after 30 minutes and may need to be restarted.

::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="ms-hosted-agents"

If your pipeline status remains **Queued** and doesn't transition to **Running** after a few moments, [Check your parallel jobs and request a free grant](/azure/devops/pipelines/licensing/concurrent-jobs#check-the-parallel-jobs-setting-directly). If you don't have access to parallel jobs, you can start the module over with Codespaces.

::: zone-end

Here, you see the steps that the build definition created. It prepares the VM, fetches the latest source code from GitHub, and then builds the app.

:::image type="content" source="../media/6-initial-build.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Azure Pipelines showing output from the initial build configuration.":::

This configuration is a great start, because now you have a place to add build tasks. You still need to update it to meet the needs of the Tailspin team, such as to minify JavaScript and CSS files.

> [!TIP]
> Check your email. You might have already received a build notification with the results of your run. You can use these notifications to let your team members know when builds complete, and whether each build passed or failed.

## Add build tasks

Now that you have a working build process, you can start to add build tasks.

Remember that you're working from the `main` branch. To hold your work, you'll now create a branch named `build-pipeline`. The branch gives you a place to experiment and get your build working completely without affecting the rest of the team.

You can add build tasks to *azure-pipelines.yml* directly from Azure Pipelines. Azure Pipelines commits your changes directly to your branch. Here, you'll change *azure-pipelines.yml* locally and *push*—or upload—your changes to GitHub. Doing it this way lets you practice your Git skills. Watch the pipeline automatically build the app when you push up changes.

In practice, you might add build tasks one at a time, push your changes, and watch the build run. Here, you'll add all the build tasks we identified earlier at one time.

> [!NOTE]
> You're about to run a few Git commands. Don't worry if you're new to Git. We'll show you what to do. We'll also go into more detail about Git in future modules.

1. In Visual Studio Code, go to the integrated terminal. Ensure you go to the `main` branch in your repo and then go through the steps.

1. To fetch the latest changes from GitHub and update your `main` branch, run this `git pull` command.

    ```bash
    git pull origin main
    ```

    You'll see from the output that Git fetches a file named *azure-pipelines.yml*. This is the starter pipeline configuration that Azure Pipelines created for you. When you set up the pipeline, Azure Pipelines adds this file to your GitHub repository.

1. To create a branch named `build-pipeline`, run this `git checkout` command:

    ```bash
    git checkout -B build-pipeline
    ```

1. In Visual Studio Code, change *azure-pipelines.yml* as you see here:

    ::: zone pivot="github-codespaces-agent"

    [!code-yml[](code/6-codespaces-azure-pipelines.yml)]

    ::: zone-end

    ::: zone pivot="ms-hosted-agents"

    [!code-yml[](code/6-azure-pipelines.yml)]

    ::: zone-end

    Under the `steps` section, you see the build tasks that map to each of the script commands that we identified earlier.

    Azure Pipelines provides built-in build tasks that map to many common build activities. For example, the `DotNetCoreCLI@2` task maps to the `dotnet` command-line utility. The pipeline uses `DotNetCoreCLI@2` two times: one time to restore, or install, the project's dependencies, and one time to build the project.

    Remember that not all build activities map to a built-in task. For example, there's no built-in task that runs the node-Sass utility, or writes build info to a text file. To run general system commands, you use the `CmdLine@2` or `script` task. The pipeline uses the `script` task because it's a common shortcut for `CmdLine@2`.

    In the build step that writes information about the build to a file, notice these elements:

    * `$(Build.DefinitionName)`
    * `$(Build.BuildId)`
    * `$(Build.BuildNumber)`

    These elements are built-in variables that the system provides for use in your pipelines:

    * `$(Build.DefinitionName)` is the name of the build pipeline. For example, "SpaceGame-Web-CI."
    * `$(Build.BuildId)` is a numeric identifier for the completed build, like 115.
    * `$(Build.BuildNumber)` is the name of the completed build. You can configure the format, but by default, the build number includes the current date followed by the build number for that day. An example build number is "20190329.1."

    You can also define your own variables, which you'll do soon.

    You might have also noticed the `UseDotNet@2` task, which is the first build step. Mara remembered that the build script didn't install the required build tools. Although the build agent comes with several .NET SDK versions, this task lets the pipeline author easily specify the version they need to use on the build agent.

1. From the integrated terminal, run the following Git commands to add *azure-pipelines.yml* to the index, commit the change, and push the change to GitHub. These steps are similar to the steps you performed earlier.

    > [!TIP]
    > Before you run these Git commands, remember to save *azure-pipelines.yml*.

    ```bash
    git add azure-pipelines.yml
    git commit -m "Add build tasks"
    git push origin build-pipeline
    ```

    This time, you push the `build-pipeline` branch, not the `main` branch, to GitHub.

    Pushing the branch to GitHub triggers the build process in Azure Pipelines.

1. In Azure Pipelines, go to your build. To do so, on the side of the page, select **Pipelines**, then select your pipeline. You'll see your commit message and that the build is running using the code from the `build-pipeline` branch.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/6-build-history.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Azure Pipelines showing the run history, including the branch you recently pushed to GitHub.":::

    > [!TIP]
    > If you don't see the build right away, wait a few moments or refresh the page.

1. Select your build and choose **Jobs** and trace the build tasks as they run.

    For example, here's what happens when the `gulp@1` task runs to perform the gulp tasks that minify JavaScript and CSS assets:

    :::image type="content" source="../media/6-gulp-task.png" alt-text="Screenshot of tracing the gulp tasks in Azure Pipelines.":::

    If any step fails, you'll see the error in the output so you can diagnose and fix the failure.

    Earlier, you ran a more minimal build configuration. This time, when the build completes, you see a more complete set of tasks needed to build the app.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/6-add-build-tasks.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Azure Pipelines showing the complete list of build tasks.":::

1. After your build completes, select any of the steps to see the overall progression of the build. From there, you can jump to the build logs or the associated change on GitHub.
