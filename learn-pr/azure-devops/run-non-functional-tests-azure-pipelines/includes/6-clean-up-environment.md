You're all done with the tasks for this module. Here, you'll clean up your Azure resources, move the work item to the **Done** state in Azure Boards, and clean up your Azure DevOps environment.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This page contains important cleanup steps. Cleaning up helps ensure that you don't run out of free build minutes. It also helps ensure that you're not charged for Azure resources after you complete this module.

## Clean up Azure resources

Here, you'll delete your Azure App Service instances. The easiest way to do that is to delete their parent resource group. Deleting a resource group deletes all resources in that group.

To clean up your resource group:

1. Go to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com?azure-portal=true) and sign in.
1. On the menu bar, select **Cloud Shell**. When you're prompted, select the **Bash** experience.

1. Run the following `az group delete` command to delete the resource group that you used in this module, **tailspin-space-game-rg**:

    ```azurecli
    az group delete --name tailspin-space-game-rg
    ```

    When you're prompted, enter **y** to confirm the operation.

1. As an optional step, after the previous command finishes, run the following `az group list` command.

    ```azurecli
    az group list --output table
    ```

    You'll see that the resource group **tailspin-space-game-rg** no longer exists.

## Disable the pipeline or delete your project

Each module in this learning path provides a template. You can run the template to create a clean environment for the duration of the module.

Running multiple templates gives you multiple Azure Pipelines projects. Each project points to the same GitHub repository. This setup can trigger multiple pipelines to run each time you push a change to your GitHub repository, which can cause you to run out of free build minutes on our hosted agents, so it's important to disable or delete your pipeline before you move on to the next module.

Choose one of the following options.

### Option 1: Disable the pipeline

Disable the pipeline so that it doesn't process further build requests. You can later reenable the build pipeline if you want to. Choose this option if you want to keep your DevOps project and your build pipeline for future reference.

To disable the pipeline:

1. In Azure Pipelines, navigate to your pipeline.
1. From the drop-down menu, select **Settings**:

    :::image type="content" source="../../shared/media/azure-pipelines-settings-button.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Azure Pipelines showing the location of the Settings menu.":::
1. Under **Processing of new run requests**, select **Disabled**, then select **Save**.

    Your pipeline will no longer process build requests.

### Option 2: Delete the Azure DevOps project

You can also delete your Azure DevOps project, including the contents of Azure Boards and your build pipeline. In future modules, you can run another template that brings up a new project in a state where this module leaves off. Choose this option if you don't need your DevOps project for future reference.

To delete the project:

1. In Azure DevOps, navigate to your project. Earlier, we recommended that you name this project **Space Game - web - Nonfunctional tests**.
1. Select **Project settings** in the lower corner.
1. At the bottom of the **Project details** area, select **Delete**.

    :::image type="content" source="../../shared/media/azure-devops-delete-project.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Azure Pipelines showing the location of the Delete button.":::
1. In the window that appears, enter the project name and select **Delete** again.

    Your project is now deleted.
