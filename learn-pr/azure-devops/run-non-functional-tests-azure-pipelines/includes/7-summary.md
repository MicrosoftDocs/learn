Nice job! In this module, we defined a _nonfunctional test_ as a test that checks characteristics like performance and reliability. Compare this type of test to a _functional test_, which verifies that a given function of the software does what it should. We also defined some popular kinds of nonfunctional tests, including load tests, stress tests, and penetration tests.

You and your team chose one type of nonfunctional test to automate the load tests first. By using a few commands, you took a test plan that was created in Apache JMeter and ran it in the pipeline. Now with each code change, the team can track the performance of the site under a normal load. If performance begins to drop, you know which change caused it.

Just as you did when you incorporated functional tests into your pipeline, focus on the types of nonfunctional tests that matter most. For example, if your team must adhere to certain compliance requirements, consider adding automated tests that provide a detailed status report.
