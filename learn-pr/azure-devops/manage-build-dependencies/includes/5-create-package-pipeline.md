Here, you get the team's new code for the **Tailspin.SpaceGame.Web.Models** project that's now separate from the **Tailspin.SpaceGame.Web** project. You create an Azure Pipelines project for the Models project and see the artifact in Azure Artifacts with a version number of 1.0.0 in your feed.

## What changes were made to the project?

Recall that the *Space Game* website is an ASP.NET Core app. It uses the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern to separate data from how that data is displayed in the user interface. Andy and Mara want to move the model classes to a separate library so that multiple projects can use those classes.

To do that, they create a new C# project called **Tailspin.SpaceGame.Web.Models** that contains only the model classes. At the same time, they remove the model classes from their existing project, **Tailspin.SpaceGame.Web**. They replace the model classes in their existing project with a reference to the **Tailspin.SpaceGame.Web.Models** project.

To build these projects, Andy and Mara use two pipelines, one for each project. You already have the first project and its associated Azure Pipelines configuration. Here, you fork the second project on GitHub and create an Azure Pipelines configuration to build it. Publish the resulting package to Azure Artifacts.

## Prepare Visual Studio Code

Previously, you set up Visual Studio Code to work with the **Tailspin.SpaceGame.Web** project. Here, you open a second instance of Visual Studio Code so you can work with the **Tailspin.SpaceGame.Web.Models** project.

1. Open a second instance of Visual Studio Code.
1. From Visual Studio Code, open the integrated terminal.
1. Navigate to the parent directory from where your **mslearn-tailspin-spacegame-web** project is located. Here's an example that moves to your home directory:

    ```bash
    cd ~
    ```

## Get the source code

Get the source code for the **Tailspin.SpaceGame.Web.Models** project from GitHub and set up Visual Studio Code so you can work with the files.

### Create a fork

The first step is to fork the **mslearn-tailspin-spacegame-web-models** repository so you can work with and modify the source files. Recall that Mara put the **Models** directory in a new project and removed it from the web project.

To fork the **mslearn-tailspin-spacegame-web-models** project into your GitHub account:

1. From a web browser, go to [GitHub](https://github.com?azure-portal=true), and sign in.
1. Go to the [mslearn-tailspin-spacegame-web-models](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/mslearn-tailspin-spacegame-web-models?azure-portal=true) project.
1. Select **Fork**.
1. To fork the repository into your account, follow the instructions.

### Clone your fork locally

To clone the **mslearn-tailspin-spacegame-web-models** projects to your computer:

1. On GitHub, go to your fork of the **mslearn-tailspin-spacegame-web-models** project.
1. Select **Code**. Then, from the **HTTPS** tab, select the button next to the URL to copy the URL to your clipboard.

    :::image type="content" source="../../shared/media/github-clone-button.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the URL and copy button from the GitHub repository.":::

1. From Visual Studio Code, go to the terminal window, and run this `git clone` command. Replace the URL with the contents of your clipboard.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-name/mslearn-tailspin-spacegame-web-models.git
    ```

1. Move to the **mslearn-tailspin-spacegame-web-models** directory. This location is the root directory of your repository.

    ```bash
    cd mslearn-tailspin-spacegame-web-models
    ```

### Open the project and examine the configuration

In Visual Studio Code, your terminal window points to the root directory of the **mslearn-tailspin-spacegame-web-models** project. Open the project from the file explorer so that you can view its structure and work with files.

1. The easiest way to open the project is to reopen Visual Studio Code in the current directory. To do so, run the following command from the integrated terminal:

    ```bash
    code -r .
    ```

    You see the directory and file tree in the file explorer.

1. Reopen the integrated terminal. The terminal places you at the root of your web project.
1. Open the *azure-pipelines.yml* file.

    You see the steps where the package is built, the version is set, and the package is added to Azure Artifacts.

    This `DotNetCoreCLI@2` task builds the project:

    ``` yml
    - task: DotNetCoreCLI@2
      displayName: 'Build the project - $(buildConfiguration)'
      inputs:
        command: 'build'
        arguments: '--no-restore --configuration $(buildConfiguration)'
        projects: '**/*.csproj'
    ```

    This `DotNetCoreCLI@2` task packages the project with a version of 1.0.0:

    ``` yml
    - task: DotNetCoreCLI@2
      displayName: 'Pack the project - $(buildConfiguration)'
      inputs:
        command: 'pack'
        projects: '**/*.csproj'
        arguments: '--no-build --configuration $(buildConfiguration)'
        versioningScheme: byPrereleaseNumber
        majorVersion: '1'
        minorVersion: '0'
        patchVersion: '0'
    ```

    When developing your package, it's common to use the `byPrereleaseNumber` versioning scheme. This approach appends a unique prerelease suffix such as `-CI-20190621-042647` to the end of the version number. Following this example, the complete version number would be `1.0.0-CI-20190621-042647`.

    This `NuGetCommand@2` task pushes the package to your **Tailspin.SpaceGame.Web.Models** Azure Artifacts feed:

    ```yml
    - task: NuGetCommand@2
      displayName: 'Publish NuGet package'
      inputs:
        command: push
        feedPublish: '$(System.TeamProject)/Tailspin.SpaceGame.Web.Models'
        allowPackageConflicts: true
      condition: succeeded()
    ```

    `feedPublish` specifies the name of the feed to publish to. The format of the name is `<projectName>/<feedName>`, where:

      * `$(System.TeamProject)` is a predefined variable that refers to your project name, for example, "Space Game - web - Dependencies".
      * `Tailspin.SpaceGame.Web.Models` is the feed name that you provided in the previous exercise.

## Set permissions

Before you can set up and run your pipeline, you need to give the Build service the correct permissions.

1. Go to your project in Azure DevOps.
1. Select **Artifacts** from the menu on the left.
1. Select the **Settings** icon at the top-right of the screen, then select the **Permissions** tab.
1. Select the **Add users/groups** button.
1. In the **Users/Groups** field, enter **Space Game - web - Dependencies Build Service**, select the **Contributor** role, and select **Save**.

## Create the pipeline in Azure Pipelines

You learned how to set up Azure Pipelines in an earlier module. If you need a refresher, head over to [Create a build pipeline with Azure Pipelines](/training/modules/create-a-build-pipeline?azure-portal=true).

Here's how to set up a second pipeline to build the package, and upload that package to Azure Artifacts.

1. From Azure DevOps, go to the **Space Game - web - Dependencies** project.
1. From the menu on the left, select **Pipelines**.
1. Select **New Pipeline**.
1. From the **Connect** tab, select **GitHub**.
1. From the **Select** tab, select **mslearn-tailspin-spacegame-web-models**.

    If prompted, enter your GitHub credentials. From the page that appears, scroll to the bottom, and select **Approve and install**.

1. From the **Review** tab, you see the new pipeline's *azure-pipelines.yml* file.
1. Select **Run**.
1. Watch the pipeline run.
1. Go to the **Artifacts** tab.
1. From the dropdown at the top, select **Tailspin.SpaceGame.Web.Models**.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/5-feed-dropdown.png" alt-text="A screenshot showing the location of the package from the dropdown.":::

    You see the resulting package, **Tailspin.SpaceGame.Web.Models**, in Azure Artifacts.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/5-artifacts-package.png" alt-text="A screenshot of the package in Azure Artifacts, showing version 1.0 of the package.":::

1. Select the package to go to the details page. Then, copy the version number to a location where you can access it later.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/5-package-details.png" alt-text="A screenshot of Azure Artifacts showing package details. Highlighted is the version number for the package.":::

    Use this version number in the next unit.
