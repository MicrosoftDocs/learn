In this module, you create a build pipeline that produces a package that multiple apps can use.

It's likely that you used open-source or other partner components in your software. Using components that are popular in the community and have already been built and tested is often the fastest way to get things done.

You might also have your own app code that you can move into a library or package so that others can use it. This code might be an open-source project, or software that only your team can access.

There are many ways to build and host your packages. The right solution depends both on the kinds of programming languages and frameworks you use and who you want to access your packages. Here, you continue your work with the Tailspin web team by creating a NuGet package for .NET that Azure Artifacts hosts.

After you complete this module, you'll be able to:

- Create and share packages that multiple applications can use.
- Create a build pipeline for your package and publish your package to Azure Artifacts.
- Connect an application to your package and build the application in Azure Pipelines.
- Push changes to your package and update your application to use them.

## Prerequisites

The modules in this learning path form a progression.

To follow the progression from the beginning, first complete the [Get started with Azure DevOps](../../../paths/evolve-your-devops-practices/index.yml?azure-portal=true) learning path.

We also recommend you start at the beginning of this learning path, [Build applications with Azure DevOps](../../../paths/build-applications-with-azure-devops/index.yml?azure-portal=true).

If you want to go through just this module, you need to set up a development environment on your Windows, macOS, or Linux system. You need:

You can get started with Azure DevOps for free.

This environment lets you complete the exercises in this and future modules. You can also use it to apply your new skills to your own projects.
