  questions:
  - content: "Which method must you call in the constructor of a page to read the XAML description of the page, loads the various controls on that page, and sets their properties?"
    choices:
    - content: "InitializeComponent"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "This is the correct answer."
    - content: "MainPage"

      explanation: "No MainPage can be a name of a Page, it does not load the XAML declaration."
    - content: "ConfigureApp"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "No. Use the InitializeComponent method."
  - content: "Which of these is a major benefit of using XAML to define your UI?"
    choices:
    - content: "XAML runs more efficiently than C# code for constructing the UI at runtime."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "No. There may be some minor difference in performance, but it could also be that in some cases defining the UI by using C# code results in more efficient code."
    - content: "You can separate the definition of the UI from the logic of the app."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "This is the correct answer."
    - content: "XAML is more portable than C# code."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "No. XAML and C# are both .NET technologies. You can run C# anywhere you can use XAML."
