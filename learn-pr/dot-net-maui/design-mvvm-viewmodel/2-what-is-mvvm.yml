  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: A developer is working on a .NET MAUI application and wants to implement the MVVM pattern. They create a model for business data and operations, and a view for user interaction. What should they create next to act as an intermediary between the model and the view?
    choices:
    - content: A controller.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. In the MVVM pattern, a controller isn't used as an intermediary between the model and the view.
    - content: A service.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. While services can be part of an application architecture, they aren't the intermediary in the MVVM pattern.
    - content: A viewmodel.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. In the MVVM pattern, the viewmodel acts as an intermediary between the model and the view.
  - content: A team is developing a mobile application using .NET MAUI and wants to ensure that their business logic is portable across different platforms. Where should they place this business logic in the MVVM pattern?
    choices:
    - content: In the model.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. In the MVVM pattern, the model is where business data and operations are located.
    - content: In the view.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. The view in MVVM is responsible for user interaction, not business logic.
    - content: In the viewmodel.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. The viewmodel acts as an intermediary between the model and the view, but it's not the primary location for business logic.
