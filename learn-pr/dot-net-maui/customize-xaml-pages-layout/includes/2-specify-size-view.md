Designing a user interface that's consistent across multiple devices is difficult because devices can be different sizes and have different pixel densities. Think about the different devices that are available: mobile, tablet, desktop, and so on. How do we create a user interface that looks similar on each?

.NET Multi-platform App UI (MAUI) provides layout panels to help you build consistent user interfaces. The layout panel is responsible for sizing and positioning the views of its children. In this unit, you learn how the layout system works in .NET MAUI. Especially, we look at how views are sized by default and how to request a specific size and position for a view at runtime.

## What is a layout panel?

A layout panel is a .NET MAUI container that holds a collection of child views and determines their size and position. The layout panels automatically recalculate when the app size changes; for example, when the user rotates the device.

> [!NOTE]
> The term *view* or *child view* refers to a control placed on a layout panel. A view can be a label, a button, an entry field, or any other type of visual element supported by .NET MAUI.

.NET MAUI has multiple layout panels that you can choose from. Each panel manages its child views differently. The following illustration shows a conceptual overview of some of the most common options.

:::image type="content" source="../media/2-layouts.png" alt-text="Illustration showing representative StackLayout, AbsoluteLayout, FlexLayout, and Grid designs.":::

- `StackLayout`: arranges its child views in a single row or column. In addition to `StackLayout`, there's also an optimized `VerticalStackLayout` and `HorizontalStackLayout` when you don't need to change orientation.
- `AbsoluteLayout`: arranges its child views by using x and y coordinates.
- `Grid`: arranges its child views in cells that are created from the intersection of rows and columns.
- `FlexLayout`: arranges its child views like a `StackLayout` except that you can wrap them if they don't fit into a single row or column.

> [!NOTE]
> There is also a fifth type of layout panel called a `RelativeLayout`, which enables you to specify how to arrange child views relative to each other. You should use the `FlexLayout` control instead of `RelativeLayout` because it performs better. `RelativeLayout` is included in .NET MAUI for backwards compatibility with older Xamarin apps.

The typical process for building a .NET MAUI page is to create a layout panel and then add child views to it. When you add a view to a layout, you can influence the size and position of it. However, the panel has the final say based on its internal layout algorithms.

Before you look at how to request a specific size for a view, let's see how the layout system sizes views by default.

## Default size of a view

If you don't specify the size of a view, it grows automatically to be exactly large enough to fit around its content. For example, consider this Extensible Application Markup Language (XAML):

```xaml
<Label
    Text="Hello"
    BackgroundColor="Silver"
    VerticalOptions="Center"
    HorizontalOptions="Center" 
    FontSize="40"/>
```

This example defines a label to display the word `Hello` on a silver background. Because you're not specifying the size, the label is automatically sized to fit around the word `Hello`. The following image shows the label rendered on an Android device:

:::image type="content" source="../media/2-label-android.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing a label rendered on an Android device that displays the word Hello in the center with a silver background.":::

> [!NOTE]
> You can set the background color of the label to help you determine how large it is at runtime. This is a good debugging technique to keep in mind as you build your UI.

## Specify the size of a view

When you build a UI, it's common to want to control the size of a view. For example, imagine you're building a sign-in page and you want the sign-in button to be exactly half the width of the screen. If you used the default sizing for a view, your button would only be the size of the text *Sign in*. That size isn't large enough, so you need to specify the size yourself.

The `View` base class defines two properties that influence the size of a view: `WidthRequest` and `HeightRequest`. `WidthRequest` lets you specify the width, and `HeightRequest` lets you specify the height. Both properties are of type `double`.

Here's an example that shows how to specify a label's width and height in XAML:

```xaml
<Label
    Text="Hello"
    BackgroundColor="Silver"
    VerticalOptions="Center"
    HorizontalOptions="Center"
    WidthRequest="100"
    HeightRequest="300"
    FontSize="40"/>
```

The result looks like this:

:::image type="content" source="../media/2-label-size-android.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing a label rendered on an Android device that displays the word Hello in the center with a silver background. The label is sized explicitly":::

> [!NOTE] 
> The label is still centered, although the text for the label isn't in the center of the label.

One thing that's worth noting is the names of these properties. Both properties contain the word *request*. This word means the layout panel might not respect them at runtime. The layout panel reads these values during its sizing calculations and tries to accommodate the requests if it can. If there's not enough space, the layout panel is allowed to ignore the values.

### Size units

When you set `WidthRequest` and `HeightRequest`, you use literal values like `100`. At the .NET MAUI level, these values don't have units. They're not points or pixels. They're just values of type `double`. .NET MAUI passes these values to the underlying operating system at runtime. It's the operating system that provides the context needed to determine what the numbers mean:

- On iOS, the values are called *points*.
- On Android, they're *density-independent pixels*.

## Rendered size of a view

Because it's up to the layout panel to determine the size of a view, you can't use `WidthRequest` and `HeightRequest` to tell you the actual size at runtime. For example, imagine you set `WidthRequest` to `100` for your label but the panel doesn't have enough space to satisfy the request. Instead, the panel gives your label a width of `80`. At this point, if you check the value of the `WidthRequest` property, it says `100` even though the rendered value is `80`.

To solve this problem, the `View` base class defines two other properties called `Width` and `Height`. These properties are of type `double` and represent the rendered width and height of a view. Use the `Width` and `Height` properties whenever you retrieve the size of a view.

## Specify the position of a view

You also need to set the position of a view. For example, recall that in the sign-in page example you wanted to size the sign-in button to be half the width of the screen. Because the sign-in button isn't the full width of the screen, there's some space available to move it around. You could position it on the left side, on the right side, or in the center of the screen.

The `View` base class has two properties that you use to set the position of a view: `VerticalOptions` and `HorizontalOptions`. These settings influence how the view is positioned within the rectangle allocated for it by the layout panel. You can specify that you want the view to align to one of the four edges of the rectangle. Or, that you want it to occupy the entire rectangle.

Specifying a value for `VerticalOptions` or `HorizontalOptions` is more challenging than setting the size because they're of type `LayoutOptions`.

## What is the LayoutOptions type?

`LayoutOptions` is a C# type that encapsulates two layout preferences, `Alignment` and `Expands`. Both properties are related to positioning, but they're not related to each other. Here's what the definition of the type looks like:

```csharp
public struct LayoutOptions
{
    public LayoutAlignment Alignment { get; set; }
    public bool Expands { get; set; }
    ...
}
```

Next, we look more closely at `Alignment` because it's the most common and intuitive layout option.

## What is the LayoutAlignment enumeration?

`LayoutAlignment` is an enumeration that contains four values: `Start`, `Center`, `End`, and `Fill`. You can use these values to control how the child view is positioned within the rectangle given to it by its layout panel. For example, consider the following code and Android screenshot:

```xaml
<StackLayout>
    <Label Text="Start" HorizontalOptions="Start" BackgroundColor="Silver" FontSize="40" />
    <Label Text="Center" HorizontalOptions="Center" BackgroundColor="Silver"  FontSize="40" />
    <Label Text="End" HorizontalOptions="End" BackgroundColor="Silver"  FontSize="40"/>
    <Label Text="Fill" HorizontalOptions="Fill" BackgroundColor="Silver"  FontSize="40"/>
</StackLayout>
```

:::image type="content" source="../media/2-layout-options.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing four labels rendered on iOS with different HorizontalOptions: Start to the left side, Center centered, End to the right side, and Fill spanning the full screen.":::

The example uses a vertical `StackLayout` so each child view is given a row. `HorizontalOptions` determines the view's position within its row.

## What is Expands?

The second property of the `LayoutOptions` struct is `Expands`. The `Expands` property is a `bool` that in Xamarin.Forms allowed a view in a `StackLayout` to request extra space if any is available. This property is now obsolete and is no longer used in .NET MAUI. Later, we explore how to achieve the same type of expanding in the unit on `Grid` layout.
