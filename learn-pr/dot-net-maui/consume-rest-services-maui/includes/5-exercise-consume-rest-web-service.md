As part of the app that engineers use on customer site visits, you need to add a feature that allows an engineer to look up the details of electrical components. This information is held in a database and accessed through a REST web service. You also need to provide an interface that allows an administrator to create, remove, and modify the details of parts held in the database using the same REST web service.

In this exercise, you deploy the REST web service to Azure, then verify that you can access it using a web browser. Then, you add functionality to an existing .NET Multi-platform App UI (MAUI) app that uses the REST web service to retrieve, add, delete, and update the details of electrical components.

You perform the deployment part of the exercise using the Azure sandbox.

## Deploy the Parts REST web service

1. In the Cloud Shell window, run the following command to clone the repo containing the code for this exercise, including the Parts REST web service:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/microsoftdocs/mslearn-dotnetmaui-consume-rest-services
    ```

1. Move to the **Consume-REST-services** folder:

    ```bash
    cd mslearn-dotnetmaui-consume-rest-services/src
    ```

1. Run the following command to deploy the Parts web service using the Azure Cloud Shell sandbox. This command makes the service available through a unique URL. When the URL is displayed, make a note of it. You configure the app to connect to the web service using this URL.

    ```bash
    bash initenvironment.sh
    ```

## Examine the code for the web service

> [!NOTE]
> You perform the remainder of this exercise on your local development computer.

1. On your computer, open a command prompt window and clone the repository for this exercise. The code is in the [net-maui-learn-consume-rest-services](https://github.com/microsoftdocs/mslearn-dotnetmaui-consume-rest-services) repository.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/microsoftdocs/mslearn-dotnetmaui-consume-rest-services
    ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > It's best to clone or download the exercise content to a short folder path, such as C:\dev\, to avoid build-generated files exceeding the maximum path length.

1. Go to the **src\webservice\PartsServer** folder in your clone of the repository, and open the **PartsServer.sln** solution using Visual Studio or the folder in Visual Studio Code. This solution contains a copy of the code for the web service that you deployed to Azure in the previous procedure.

1. In the Solution Explorer window, expand the **Models** folder. This folder contains two files:

    - **Part.cs**. The **Part** class represents a part as provided by the REST web service. The fields include the part ID, part name, part type, the availability date (when the part was first supplied), and a list of suppliers. The `Href` property returns the relative URI of the part; a REST client can use this URI to reference this specific part in the REST web service. The `Suppliers` property returns the list of suppliers of the part as a string.

    - **PartsFactory.cs**. The **PartsFactory** class initializes the list of parts provided by the service, using a small set of hard-coded values. In the real world, this data would be retrieved from a database.

1. In the Solution Explorer window, expand the **Controllers** folder. This folder contains the following files:

    - **PartsController.cs**. The **PartsController** class implements the web API for the service. It includes methods that enable a client application to retrieve a list of all parts (**Get**), find the details of a specific part given the part ID (the overloaded version of **Get**), update the details of a part (**Put**), add a new part to the list (**Post**), and remove a part from the list (**Delete**).

    - **LoginController.cs**. The **LoginController** class implements a simple form of authentication for the web service. An app must send an HTTP **GET** request to this controller, which returns an authorization token. This authorization token is used to authenticate the requests sent to the **PartsController**.

    - **BaseController.cs**. The **BaseController** class contains the logic used to authenticate requests. The **PartsController** class inherits from this class. If the client attempts to call methods in the **PartsController** class without providing a valid authentication token, the methods return an HTTP 401 (unauthorized) response.

## Examine the code for the .NET MAUI client app

[!include[](../../../includes/dotnet9-sdk-version.md)]

1. Close the **PartsServer** solution, and open the **PartsClient** solution in the **src\client\PartsClient** folder in the cloned repository. This solution contains a partial implementation of a .NET MAUI client app that uses the **PartsServer** web service.

1. In the Solution Explorer window, expand the **Data** folder. This folder contains the code for two classes:

    - **PartsManager.cs**. The **PartsManager** class provides the methods that the client app uses to interact with the REST web service. This class is currently incomplete; you add the necessary code during this exercise. When complete, the **GetClient** method connects to the REST web service. The **GetAll** method returns a list of parts from the REST web service. The **Add** method adds a new part to the list of parts managed by the REST web service. The **Update** method modifies the details of a part stored by the REST web service, and the **Delete** method removes a part.

    - **Part.cs**. The **Part** class models a part stored in the database. It exposes properties that an application can use to access the **PartID**, **PartName**, **PartAvailableDate**, **PartType**, and **PartSuppliers** fields. The class also provides a utility method named **SupplierString** that an application can use to retrieve a formatted string containing the supplier names.

1. In the Solution Explorer window, expand the **Pages** folder. This folder contains the markup and code for two pages:

    - **PartsPage.xaml**. This page uses a **CollectionView** layout with a **DataTemplate** to display the details of the parts available as a list. The **DataTemplate** uses data binding to connect the data displayed to the parts retrieved from the web service. You can select a row in the **CollectionView** to edit a part in the **AddPartPage**, or you can select the **Add New Part** button to add a new part.

    - **AddPartPage.xaml**. This page allows users to enter and save the details for a new part. Users can specify the part name, part type, and an initial supplier. The part ID and part available date are generated automatically.

1. In the Solution Explorer window, expand the **ViewModels** folder. This folder contains two classes: **AddPartViewModel.cs** and **PartsViewModel.cs**. These classes are the view models for their respective pages and contain properties and logic the page needs to display and manipulate data.

## Sign in to the service

The REST service requires you to sign in first to get an authorization token. There's no user authentication. You call a specific endpoint first to get an authorization token, then you send the token back to the server on each subsequent request in the HTTP header.

1. Open the **PartsManager.cs** file in the **Data** folder.

1. Add **BaseAddress** and **Url** static fields as defined in the following code snippet to the **PartsManager** class. Replace the text **URL GOES HERE** with the URL of the REST web service that you noted earlier:

    ```csharp
    public class PartsManager
    {
        static readonly string BaseAddress = "URL GOES HERE";
        static readonly string Url = $"{BaseAddress}/api/";
        ...
    }
    ```

1. Add the following field to the class, after the **Url** field. This field holds the authorization token returned when the user signs in:

    ```csharp
    private static string authorizationKey;
    ```

1. Find the **GetClient** method. This method currently throws a **NotImplementedException** exception. Replace the existing code in this method with the following code. This code creates an **HttpClient** object, then sends a request to the **login** endpoint of the REST web service. The service should respond with a message that contains the authorization token. Deserialize this token, and add it as a default Authorization request header for subsequent requests sent using the **HttpClient** object:

    ```csharp
    private static async Task<HttpClient> GetClient()
    {
        if (client != null)
            return client;

        client = new HttpClient();

        if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(authorizationKey))
        {                
            authorizationKey = await client.GetStringAsync($"{Url}login");
            authorizationKey = JsonSerializer.Deserialize<string>(authorizationKey);
        }

        client.DefaultRequestHeaders.Add("Authorization", authorizationKey);
        client.DefaultRequestHeaders.Add("Accept", "application/json");

        return client;
    }
    ```

## Perform a GET operation to retrieve information for parts

1. In the **PartsManager.cs** file, find the **GetAll** method. An asynchronous method that returns an enumerable list of parts. This method isn't yet implemented.

1. In this method, delete the code that throws the **NotImplementedException** exception.
1. Check to see if the device has internet connectivity by using the `Connectivity` class. If the internet isn't present, return an empty `List<Part>`.

    ```csharp
    if (Connectivity.Current.NetworkAccess != NetworkAccess.Internet)
        return new List<Part>();
    ```

1. Call the **GetClient** method to retrieve an **HttpClient** object to work with. Remember that **GetClient** is asynchronous, so use the `await` operator to capture the object returned by this method.

1. Call the **GetStringAsync** method of the **HttpClient** object and provide the base URL to retrieve an array of parts from the REST web service. The data is returned asynchronously as a JSON string.

1. Deserialize the JSON string returned by this method into a list of **Part** objects using the **JsonSerializer.Deserialize** method. Return this list to the caller.

    The completed method should look like this:

    ```csharp
    public static async Task<IEnumerable<Part>> GetAll()
    {
        if (Connectivity.Current.NetworkAccess != NetworkAccess.Internet)
            return new List<Part>();
        
        var client = await GetClient();
        string result = await client.GetStringAsync($"{Url}parts");

        return JsonSerializer.Deserialize<List<Part>>(result, new JsonSerializerOptions
            {
                PropertyNameCaseInsensitive = true,
            });                     
    }
    ```

1. Build and run the app. When the app starts, the Part List page appears and a list of parts retrieved by the **GetAll** method should appear. The following image shows the app running on Android:

    :::image type="content" source="../media/5-all-parts.png" alt-text="A screenshot of the Parts Client app running on Android showing a list of parts.":::

1. When you're finished browsing the data, close the app and return to Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code.

## Perform a POST operation to add a new part to the database

1. In the **PartsManager** class, locate the **Add** method. This method has parameters for the part name, a supplier, and the part type. The method is asynchronous. The method's purpose is to insert a new part into the database and return a **Part** object representing the newly created item.

1. Delete the existing code in the method.
1. Check to see if the device has internet connectivity by using the `Connectivity` class. If the internet isn't present, return an empty `Part`.

    ```csharp
    if (Connectivity.Current.NetworkAccess != NetworkAccess.Internet)
        return new Part();
    ```

1. Create a new **Part** object. Populate the fields with the passed-in data:

    - Set the **PartID** field to an empty string. The REST web service generates this ID.
    - Create a new **List** to hold the name of the supplier.
    - Set the **PartAvailableDate** field to **DateTime.Now**.
    - Get an HTTP client from the **GetClient** method.

    ```csharp
    var part = new Part()
    {
        PartName = partName,
        Suppliers = new List<string>(new[] { supplier }),
        PartID = string.Empty,
        PartType = partType,
        PartAvailableDate = DateTime.Now.Date
    };
    ```

1. Call the **GetClient** method to retrieve an **HttpClient** object to work with.
1. Create an `HttpRequestMessage` object. This object is used to model the request that is sent to the web service. Initiate it with parameters indicating which HTTP verb to use and the URL of the web service to communicate with.

    ```csharp
    var msg = new HttpRequestMessage(HttpMethod.Post, $"{Url}parts");
    ```

1. You need to send a payload to the webservice with the **Part** information to create. This payload is serialized to JSON. The JSON payload is added to the `HttpRequestMessage.Content` property and is serialized with the `JsonContent.Create` method.

    ```csharp
    msg.Content = JsonContent.Create<Part>(part);
    ```

1. Now send the message to the web service with the `HttpClient.SendAsync` function. That function returns a `HttpResponseMessage` object that holds information about the operation on the server. Such as HTTP response codes and information passed back from the server.

    ```csharp
    var response = await client.SendAsync(msg);
    response.EnsureSuccessStatusCode();
    ```

    The preceding code uses the `response.EnsureSuccessStatusCode` method which throws an error if anything other than a 2xx HTTP status code is returned.

1. If the web service returns information, such as an object serialized in JSON, you can read it out of the `HttpResponseMessage`. Then, you can deserialize the JSON using `JsonSerializer.Deserialize`.

    ```csharp
    var returnedJson = await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();

    var insertedPart = JsonSerializer.Deserialize<Part>(returnedJson, new JsonSerializerOptions
            {
                PropertyNameCaseInsensitive = true,
            });
    ```

1. Finally, return the new inserted **Part**.

    ```csharp
    return insertedPart;
    ```

1. Build and run the app. Select the **Add New Part** button and enter a name, type, and supplier to create a new part. Select **Save**. The **Add** method in the **PartsManager** class is invoked, which creates the new part in the web service. If the operation is successful, the part list page reappears with the new part at the bottom of the list.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/5-insert-part.png" alt-text="A screenshot of the app running after a new part is added. The new part is at the bottom of the list.":::

1. When you're finished browsing the data, close the app and return to Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code.

## Perform a PUT operation to update the details for a part in the database

1. In the **PartsManager** class, find the **Update** method. This asynchronous method takes a **Part** object as the parameter. The method doesn't have an explicit return value. However, the return type is **Task** so that exceptions are properly returned back to the caller. Let's implement the **PUT** functionality.

1. Delete the existing code.
1. As before, check for an internet connection.

    ```csharp
    if (Connectivity.Current.NetworkAccess != NetworkAccess.Internet)
        return;
    ```

1. Create a new `HttpRequestMessage`. This time, specify a **PUT** operation and the URL for updating parts.

    ```csharp
    HttpRequestMessage msg = new(HttpMethod.Put, $"{Url}parts/{part.PartID}");
    ```

1. Set the `Content` property of the `HttpRequestMessage` using the `JsonContent.Create` function and the **part** parameter that was passed into the function.

    ```csharp
    msg.Content = JsonContent.Create<Part>(part);
    ```

1. Get an HTTP client from the **GetClient** method.

    ```csharp
    var client = await GetClient();
    ```

1. Send the request with the `HttpClient` and then make sure it was successful.

    ```csharp
    var response = await client.SendAsync(msg);
    response.EnsureSuccessStatusCode();
    ```

1. Build and run the app. Select one of the parts from the list. The **AddPart** page appears, this time with the properties already filled in. Update whatever you'd like.

1. Select **Save**. This calls the **Update** method in the **PartsManager** class to send the changes to the web service. If successful, the parts list page reappears with your changes reflected.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/5-update-part.png" alt-text="A screenshot of the app running with the first item in the list updated.":::

    > [!NOTE]
    > The part you added in the previous task doesn't appear on the **Part List** page. To provide consistency when testing the app, the data the app uses is reset to a list of predefined parts each time the app runs.

## Perform a DELETE operation to remove the details for a part from the database

1. In the **PartsManager** class, find the **Delete** method. This asynchronous method takes a **partId** string and returns a **Task**.

1. Delete the existing code.
1. Check for an internet connection.

    ```csharp
    if (Connectivity.Current.NetworkAccess != NetworkAccess.Internet)
        return;
    ```

1. Create a new `HttpRequestMessage` object. Only now specify the **DELETE** HTTP verb and the URL to delete a part.

    ```csharp
    HttpRequestMessage msg = new(HttpMethod.Delete, $"{Url}parts/{partID}");
    ```

1. Get an HTTP client from the **GetClient** method.

    ```csharp
    var client = await GetClient();
    ```

1. Send the request to the web service. Check for success after it returns.

    ```csharp
    var response = await client.SendAsync(msg);
    response.EnsureSuccessStatusCode();
    ```

1. Build and run the app. Select a part from the list and then select **Delete** on the **Add Part** page. If successful, the **Part List** page reappears and the part you deleted is no longer visible.
