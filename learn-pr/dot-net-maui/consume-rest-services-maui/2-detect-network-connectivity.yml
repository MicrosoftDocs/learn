  title: Knowledge check
  questions:
  - content: "Which of the following answers is the best reason to check if you're connected to the Internet before running network code?"
    choices:
    - content: "You don't want to waste resources by performing operations that aren't going to do anything."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "No. You want to provide a good user experience if network connectivity is limited or unavailable."
    - content: "You want to provide a good user experience if network connectivity is limited or unavailable."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "This answer is correct."
    - content: "You want to establish a connection if you're not currently connected."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "No. You want to provide a good user experience if network connectivity is limited or unavailable."
  - content: Suppose you're writing application that a user can run while traveling in a vehicle. If the vehicle enters a tunnel, the device might lose Internet connectivity. Which member of the `Connectivity` class should you use to detect the change in network connectivity?"
    choices:
    - content: "The `NetworkAccess` property."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "No. The `NetworkAccess` property informs you if you're connected to the Internet, but the app must check the value of this property to determine the network status. This means that you have to create a polling system to detect when the app lost the connection. It's better to use the `ConnectivityChanged` event that can run code automatically when the network status changes."
    - content: "The `ConnectionStatus` property."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "No. There's no such property. Use the `ConnectivityChanged` event that can run code automatically when the network status changes."
    - content: "The `ConnectivityChanged` event."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "This answer is correct."
