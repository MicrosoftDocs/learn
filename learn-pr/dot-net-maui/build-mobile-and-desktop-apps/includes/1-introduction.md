.NET MAUI is a multi-platform framework for creating native desktop and mobile apps with C# and XAML. .NET MAUI is an acronym for Multi-platform Application User Interface. Using .NET MAUI, you can design mobile apps that can run on Windows, Android, iOS, iPadOS, and macOS.

Suppose you work for a national/regional grocery store chain. The chain wants to expand their loyalty program with a mobile and desktop app. The new app allows one-touch dialing to the store, and also pushes notifications about special offers when the user is at the store. The app therefore needs access to some hardware features.

You've been tasked with identifying the technology and building a proof-of-concept. You identify .NET MAUI as a likely technology choice. .NET MAUI enables you to reuse the same application code and markup for creating a user interface (UI), and easily access hardware and platform-specific features, like the phone dialer and location services. Additionally, with .NET MAUI you can make use of the C# skills of the developers you already work with.
