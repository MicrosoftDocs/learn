  questions:
  - content: "The value to which a `StaticResource` refers is assigned to a variable. What happens when the value then changes?"
    choices:
    - content: "Nothing, the lookup only occurs once and any further changes in the backing dictionary won't be reflected."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The `StaticResource` is only evaluated once when the target property value is being set."
    - content: "An exception will be thrown."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This is incorrect. An exception will be thrown if you try to access a key that isn't found."
    - content: "The value the `StaticResource` has been assigned to will change immediately."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This is incorrect. It's called a `StaticResource` because it only is evaluated once."
