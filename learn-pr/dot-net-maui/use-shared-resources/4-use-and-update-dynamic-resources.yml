  title: Knowledge check
  questions:
  - content: "What feature does a `DynamicResource` provide that a `StaticResource` doesn't?"
    choices:
    - content: "It's easier to use."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The usage of a `StaticResource` and a `DynamicResource` are similar. In a practical sense, only the keywords are different."
    - content: "It listens for changes in the backing Dictionary and updates the user interface on a change."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. `DynamicResource` is an extension for looking up values in a dictionary, but it propagates any changes in those values to the user interface."
    - content: "The `DynamicResource` throws an exception if you try to access a value for a nonexistent key."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. If the `DynamicResource` can't find the key in the Dictionary, it leaves the property unset."
