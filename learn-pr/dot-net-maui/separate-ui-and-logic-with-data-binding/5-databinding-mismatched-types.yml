  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "To display and format a value as a string in data binding, which is the best approach?"
    choices:
    - isCorrect: false
      content: "Expose a secondary property that formats the value as a string."
      explanation: "While you could create a new property, you end up exposing a string for a single purpose. If you wanted to show that value elsewhere, you would have to create another property formatted for that specific scenario."
    - isCorrect: true
      content: "Use the StringFormat binding property."
      explanation: "You format the data with the binding. This option makes it easy to change the string format based on how the UI displays the data."
    - isCorrect: false
      content: "Use a binding converter."
      explanation: "Using a converter in this scenario is usually not the correct approach. Binding converters are used when you have extra logic in converting a value to a string."
  - content: "Which type is used in data binding conversion?"
    choices:
    - isCorrect: true
      content: "IValueConverter"
      explanation: "This interface is used by the data binding system and you implement it to create your own data conversion classes."
    - isCorrect: false
      content: "IConvertible"
      explanation: "This interface is provided by the base class library, and converts an object to different value type representations. The class isn't usable as a XAML binding converter."
    - isCorrect: false
      content: "TypeConverter"
      explanation: "This class is used by Windows Forms for data conversion. It isn't used by .NET MAUI."
