  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "Which is true of the source object in a .NET MAUI binding?"
    choices:
    - isCorrect: true
      content: "It can be any type."
      explanation: "The source object can be any type."
    - isCorrect: false
      content: "It must be a `BindableObject`."
      explanation: "The source doesn't need to be a `BindableObject`."
    - isCorrect: false
      content: "It must be a subclass of `View`."
      explanation: "The source doesn't need to be a `View`."
  - content: "Which is true of the target property in .NET MAUI binding?"
    choices:
    - isCorrect: false
      content: "It can be any public property."
      explanation: "The source path can be any public property, but the target has restrictions."
    - isCorrect: true
      content: "It must be a `BindableProperty`."
      explanation: "The target property must be a `BindableProperty`."
    - isCorrect: false
      content: "It must be a `DependencyProperty`."
      explanation: ".NET MAUI doesn't use the type `DependencyProperty`."
  - content: "If all the bindings on controls within a `Grid` need the same source object, what is the safest strategy to set the source object only once?"
    choices:
    - isCorrect: false
      content: "Set the `Page`'s `BindingContext` property."
      explanation: "Setting the `BindingContext` at the `Page` level might not work as intended. There might be a non-null `BindingContext` lower in the visual tree that would take precedence over the object set at the `Page` level."
    - isCorrect: false
      content: "Set the `Page`'s `Source` property."
      explanation: "`Page` doesn't have a `Source` property, only bindings do."
    - isCorrect: true
      content: "Set the `Grid`'s `BindingContext` property."
      explanation: "Setting the `BindingContext` on the `Grid` is the safest choice. There's no chance a different `BindingContext` will be used as the source for the bindings."
