  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "Which of the following statements describe how data binding improves the UI?"
    choices:
    - isCorrect: false
      content: "You never have to write code related to your UI again."
      explanation: "While you could design a code-less UI, you don't have to, and it's not the most important feature of data binding. Data binding is beneficial because it provides a system where you have real-time updates to the UI when the underlying data changes."
    - isCorrect: true
      content: "The UI is automatically kept in sync with the data."
      explanation: "One benefit of adding data binding your UI, is that it keeps the UI elements in sync with the properties of the data object. It also helps separate app logic from app presentation."
  - content: "In an app that retrieves the latest weather, a label control that represents the temperature is bound to the data object. When the user presses the \"Get Weather\" button, triggering the `Clicked` event, what would the event handler code do to update the UI?"
    choices:
    - isCorrect: true
      content: "From the event handler, invoke the weather service and update the weather data object with the latest information."
      explanation: "Since the code-behind is only \"talking\" to the data object and not the label, it isn't tightly coupled to the label. The label automatically updates its text when the bound data object is changed."
    - isCorrect: false
      content: "From the event handler, do nothing. The temperature label is data bound so it should update automatically."
      explanation: "Even though the text of the label is bound to the data object, something still needs to retrieve the latest data and put it into the data object. Otherwise, if the data object doesn't update, neither does the UI."
    - isCorrect: false
      content: "From the event handler, invoke the weather service and then set the temperature label's text."
      explanation: "In this case, the code-behind is tightly coupled to the label, and directly updating the label circumvents the data binding. If the label was changed to a different control, the code-behind could break. Decoupling controls from the code-behind avoids problems like this."
