# Did I get this block 1 question 1
  - content: "Company X is building a datacenter with ten 4U servers, two 5U storage arrays, and two 1U network switches in a standard-height rack. How many racks will the company need to mount all this hardware?"
    choices:
    - content: "Two racks"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct!"
    - content: "One rack"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The company needs two racks because it has a total of 40 + 10 + 2 = 52U of equipment. A standard-height rack is 42U. You have been given the size of a server in U and the total capacity of the rack in U. How do you compute the total number of servers?"
    - content: "Three racks"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The company needs two racks because it has a total of 40 + 10 + 2 = 52U of equipment. A standard-height rack is 42U. You have been given the size of a server in U and the total capacity of the rack in U. How do you compute the total number of servers?"
    - content: "One-half rack"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The company needs two racks because it has a total of 40 + 10 + 2 = 52U of equipment. A standard-height rack is 42U. You have been given the size of a server in U and the total capacity of the rack in U. How do you compute the total number of servers?"

# Did I get this block 1 question 2 part A
# Original course has one scenario with a two-part question. Added these as separate questions.
# Original course uses text fields for user to enter numerical answers.
# Added sample incorrect answers for next two questions.
  - content: "Company X is also considering blade servers with the following specifications: <br>
      <ul><li>Blade enclosure (chassis): 7U</li>
      <li>Number of blade servers: 20 servers per 7U chassis</li></ul>
      The company is planning to fully populate the rack with servers. Assume that network and power distribution is off rack. How many blade enclosures can fit in a 42U rack?"
    choices:
    - content: "Two blade enclosures"
      isCorrect: false

      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct!"
    - content: "Seven blade enclosures"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Blade servers go into blade enclosures, which go into a rack. The right answer is 42 / 7 = 6."  

# Did I get this block 1 question 2 part B

    - content: "120 servers"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct!"
    - content: "100 servers"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Blade servers go into blade enclosures, which go into a rack. The right answer is 6 × 20 = 120."
    - content: "42 servers"

      explanation: "Incorrect. Blade servers go into blade enclosures, which go into a rack. The right answer is 6 × 20 = 120."

# Did I get this block 2 question 1
  - content: "What's the difference between SATA and SAS drives?"
    choices:
    - content: "SATA allows drives to be daisy chained through SATA expanders."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. SAS allows a single drive to be connected to two drive controllers for failover redundancy. You might have heard of SATA already, as they're present in most desktops and laptops. SAS disks are mainly used in servers, so what additional features will they have to support?"
    - content: "SAS allows a single drive to be connected to two drive controllers for failover redundancy."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct!"    
    - content: "SAS doesn't support daisy chaining."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. SATA supports daisy chaining via an SAS expander. You might have heard of SATA already, as they're present in most desktops and laptops. SAS disks are mainly used in servers, so what additional features will they have to support?"

  - content: "Which of the following is **not** a feature of SSD drives?"
    choices:
    - content: "Higher performance than spinning drives"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The technology behind SSDs that allows non-volatile writes to flash chips comes with a price."
    - content: "No moving parts"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect.  The technology behind SSDs that allows non-volatile writes to flash chips comes with a price."
