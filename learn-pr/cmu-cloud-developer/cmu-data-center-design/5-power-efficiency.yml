  - content: "You have 200 servers in your organization, each with an average 10% CPU utilization, with P<sub>idle</sub> of 200 W and P<sub>max</sub> of 300 W. If you virtualized these servers and consolidated onto 40 larger servers, each with P<sub>idle</sub> of 250 W and P<sub>max</sub> of 800 W and an average utilization of 50%, How much power (in watts) would you save?"

    choices:
    - content: "The ability of a datacenter to deliver power to IT equipment"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. PUE is a measure of how efficiently a datacenter uses power. (PUE stands for Power Usage Efficiency.)"      
    - content: "How efficiently a datacenter uses power"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct!"
    - content: "The efficiency of the datacenter"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. PUE is a measure of how efficiently a datacenter uses power. (PUE stands for Power Usage Efficiency.)"      
    - content: "The power ratio of IT to cooling in a datacenter"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. PUE is a measure of how efficiently a datacenter uses power. (PUE stands for Power Usage Efficiency.)"

# Did I Get This block 3 question
# Converted text field into multiple choice answers
  - content: "You have 12 servers, each with 1 PSU, measured to consume 500 W max. You also have three-phase 208-V PDUs with multiple branches, each branch with a 20-A breaker. How many PDU branches will you need to power the 12 servers?"
    choices:
    - content: "4.6"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Look at the formula above. Make sure you divide by 1.73, and use the derated value of 16 A instead of 20 A."
    - content: "12"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Look at the formula above. Make sure you divide by 1.73, and use the derated value of 16 A instead of 20 A."

    - content: "25 kW"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct!"
    - content: "50 kW"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Think about how the load is distributed, given that there are multiple UPSes. The correct answer is 25 kW because the load is distributed among four UPSs."

# Converted text field into multiple choice answers
  - content: "What is the maximum load (in kilowatts) each UPS should be capable of handling?"
    choices:
    - content: "24 kW"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Think about the worst-case failure scenario. Each UPS should handle at least 33 kW."
    - content: "30 kW"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Think about the worst-case failure scenario. Each UPS should handle at least 33 kW."
    - content: "33 kW"

      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! Each PSU is only 250 W."
    - content: "No"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. How many watts is each PSU rated at? Each PSU is only 250 W."

# Did I Get This block 4 question 3
  - content: "Will this be sufficient (and conform to electrical code) if power feed A fails?"
    choices:
    - content: "Yes"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. What's the wattage limit through a single branch according to the electrical code? Although it might not trip the breaker, running a 2,000-W load through a single branch (16 A × 208 V / 1.73 = 1,923-W limit) does not conform to code."    
    - content: "No"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! Although it might not trip the breaker, running a 2,000-W load through a single branch (16 A × 208 V / 1.73 = 1,923-W limit) does not conform to code."
