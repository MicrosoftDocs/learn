# Did I Get This block question 1    
  - content: "Based on Hadoop's architectural model, how are tasks assigned to slots in TaskTrackers?"
    choices:
    - content: "Push strategy: the JobTracker directly assigns tasks to individual task slots."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. TaskTrackers always report their status to the JobTracker, which assigns the individual TaskTrackers with tasks if they are free. Review how tasks are assigned to individual TaskTrackers in Hadoop."
    - content: "Pull strategy: the TaskTrackers notify the JobTracker of vacant slots and ask for tasks to be allotted to their vacant slots."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! TaskTrackers always report their status to the JobTracker, which assigns the individual TaskTrackers with tasks if they are free. This is a pull strategy."
    - content: "Push-pull strategy: the JobTracker pushes tasks to TaskTrackers without checking for vacant slots, and TaskTrackers pull tasks from the JobTracker by always requesting them."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. TaskTrackers always report their status to the JobTracker, which assigns the individual TaskTrackers with tasks if they are free. Review how tasks are assigned to individual TaskTrackers in Hadoop."

# Did I Get This block question 2
# Question uses image that's missing in the original course. Added image placeholder.
# Original course uses text field for each distance value. For yaml, made choices of possible values for all distances.
#  - content: "Assume the following network topology:<br> 
#             <img src=./media/quiz-placeholder.png></img> <br>
#             Compute the following distances:"
#    choices:
#    - content: "D(TT<sup>1</sup>,TT<sup>1</sup>) = 0, D(TT<sup>1</sup>,TT<sup>2</sup>) = 1, D(TT<sup>1</sup>,TT<sup>4</sup>) = 4, D(TT<sup>5</sup>,TT<sup>3</sup>) = 3"
#      isCorrect: false
#      explanation: "Incorrect. Each edge traversed to get from one TaskTracker to another counts as 1."
#    - content: "D(TT<sup>1</sup>,TT<sup>1</sup>) = 0, D(TT<sup>1</sup>,TT<sup>2</sup>) = 1, D(TT<sup>1</sup>,TT<sup>4</sup>) = 4, D(TT<sup>5</sup>,TT<sup>3</sup>) = 5"
#      isCorrect: false
#      explanation: "Incorrect. Each edge traversed to get from one TaskTracker to another counts as 1."
#    - content: "D(TT<sup>1</sup>,TT<sup>1</sup>) = 0, D(TT<sup>1</sup>,TT<sup>2</sup>) = 2, D(TT<sup>1</sup>,TT<sup>4</sup>) = 4, D(TT<sup>5</sup>,TT<sup>3</sup>) = 4"
#      isCorrect: true
#      explanation: "Correct!"
#    - content: "D(TT<sup>1</sup>,TT<sup>1</sup>) = 1, D(TT<sup>1</sup>,TT<sup>2</sup>) = 2, D(TT<sup>1</sup>,TT<sup>4</sup>) = 5, D(TT<sup>5</sup>,TT<sup>3</sup>) = 4"
#      isCorrect: false
#      explanation: "Incorrect. Each edge traversed to get from one TaskTracker to another counts as 1."
