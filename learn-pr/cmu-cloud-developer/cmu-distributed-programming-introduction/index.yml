title: What is distributed programming?
summary: Learn about distributed programming and why it's useful for the cloud, including programming models, types of parallelism, and symmetrical vs. asymmetrical architecture.
abstract: | 
  In this module, you will:
    - Classify programs as sequential, concurrent, parallel, and distributed
    - Indicate why programmers usually parallelize sequential programs
    - Explain why cloud programs are important for solving complex computing problems
    - Define distributed systems, and indicate the relationship between distributed systems and clouds
    - Define distributed programming models
    - Indicate why synchronization is needed in shared-memory systems
    - Describe how tasks can communicate by using the message-passing programming model
    - Outline the difference between synchronous and asynchronous programs
    - Explain the bulk synchronous parallel (BSP) model
    - Outline the difference between data parallelism and graph parallelism
    - Distinguish between these distributed programs: single program, multiple data (SPMD); and multiple program, multiple data (MPMD)
    - Discuss the two main techniques that can be incorporated in distributed programs so as to address the communication bottleneck in the cloud
    - Define heterogeneous and homogenous clouds, and identify the main reasons for heterogeneity in the cloud
    - State when and why synchronization is required in the cloud
    - Identify the main technique that can be used to tolerate faults in clouds
    - Outline the difference between task scheduling and job scheduling

  In partnership with Dr. Majd Sakr and Carnegie Mellon University.
