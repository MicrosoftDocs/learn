  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "Consider the following scenario. You're using Azure Load Balancer with a round-robin scheduler as a front end to two web servers. One server is a medium instance with two cores and 8 GB of RAM. The other server is a large instance with four cores and 16 GB of RAM. Which of the following scenarios is likely?"
    choices:
    - content: "Both instances will receive an equal amount of load. The large instance will have half the utilization (in terms of percentage of CPU and memory) of the medium instance."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct!"
    - content: "The large instance will receive twice the load of the medium instance. The large instance will have twice the utilization (in terms of percentage of CPU and memory) of the medium instance."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Round-robin distribution effectively alternates in sending requests to each instance behind it. Consider the mechanism that Azure Load Balancer uses to distribute load across multiple machines."
