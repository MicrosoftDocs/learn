title: Build applications on the cloud
summary: Learn how developers write programs that run on the cloud, including how to deploy, be fault-tolerant, load balance, scale, and deal with latency.
abstract: | 
  In this module, you will:
  - Evaluate different considerations when programming applications that run on clouds
  - Evaluate different considerations when deploying applications on clouds
  - Compare and contrast proactive and reactive measures for fault tolerance in cloud applications
  - Describe the importance of load balancing in cloud applications and enumerate various methods to achieve it
  - Enumerate the strategies and considerations in scaling cloud applications
  - Motivate the case for minimizing tail latency and discuss the various strategies to reduce tail latency
  - Describe the strategies to optimize total operational cost of using cloud services
  
  In partnership with Dr. Majd Sakr and Carnegie Mellon University.
