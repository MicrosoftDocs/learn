summary: Learn about how computing power is virtualized to create cloud resources. Covers different types of CPU virtualization.
abstract: | 
  In this module, you will:
  - Distinguish between different modes of operations in various systems such as traditional operating systems and virtualized systems
  - Identify the three main classes of system instructions
  - Indicate the condition to enable efficient hypervisors
  - Explain how a hypervisor can handle system traps
  - Identify the difference between efficient hypervisors and hypervisors
  - Describe why and when code patching is needed
  - Recognize the dissimilarity between full virtualization and paravirtualization
  - Explain the advantages and disadvantages of full virtualization and paravirtualization
  - Identify the difference between emulation and direct native execution
  - 'Recognize the two types of emulation: interpretation and binary translation'
  - Explain some major interpretation and binary translation techniques
  - Compare and contrast decode-and-dispatch, direct-threaded, and indirect-threaded interpreters
  - Identify the difference in virtual CPU allocation between symmetric multiprocessing and uniprocessor virtual machines
  - 'Describe the two major virtual CPU schedulers in Xen: Simple Earliest Deadline First and Credit Scheduler'
    
  In partnership with Dr. Majd Sakr and Carnegie Mellon University.
