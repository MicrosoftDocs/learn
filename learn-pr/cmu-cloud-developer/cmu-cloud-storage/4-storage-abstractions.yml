  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "Applications can interact with storage devices using the following abstractions:"
    choices:
    - content: "Block devices, file systems, and databases"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! Applications can interact with storage devices using any of the given abstractions."
    - content: "File systems and databases"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's not quite right. Applications can interact with more than just a file system or a database. If you write a program that interacts with a storage device, what kinds
                    of APIs can you access? What abstractions do those APIs provide?"
    - content: "Only databases"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's not quite right. Applications can interact with more than just a database. If you write a program that interacts with a storage device, what kinds
