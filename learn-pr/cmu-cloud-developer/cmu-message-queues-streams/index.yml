  In this module, you will:
  - Define a message queue and recall a basic architecture
  - Recall the characteristics, and present the advantages and disadvantages, of a message queue
  - Explain the basic architecture of Apache Kafka
  - Discuss the roles of topics and partitions, as well as how scalability and fault tolerance are achieved
  - Discuss general requirements of stream processing systems
