  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "What is the main difference between the Lambda and Kappa architectures?"
    choices:
    - content: "Lambda architectures include a layer for batch processing, while Kappa architectures do not."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct!"
    - content: "Kappa architectures include a layer for batch processing, while Lambda does not."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. One of the architectures supports batch processing but the other does not. Review the material if you're not sure."
    - content: "Both architectures are fundamentally the same."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. One of the architectures supports batch processing but the other does not. Review the material if you're not sure."
