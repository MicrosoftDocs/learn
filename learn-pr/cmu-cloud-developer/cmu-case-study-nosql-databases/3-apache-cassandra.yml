quiz:
  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:

# Did I Get This block 1 has only intro statement and no visible graphic      
# content: "Arrange the various entities of a Cassandra table in *decreasing* order of size in the HBase hierarchy:"

# Did I Get This block 2 question 1
  - content: "Which topology does Cassandra follow?"
    choices:
    - content: "Master-subordinate topology"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. All the nodes in Cassandra have the same role."
    - content: "Peer-to-peer topology"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct!"

# Did I Get This block 2 question 2
  - content: "Which methods are used to keep data replicas in Cassandra consistent?"
    choices:
    - content: "Antientropy"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's not quite right. Antientropy is used to keep data replicas in Cassandra consistent, but it isn't the only method."
    - content: "Read repairs"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's not quite right. Read repairs are used to keep data replicas in Cassandra consistent, but it isn't the only method."
    - content: "Hinted handoff"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's not quite right. Hinted handoff is used to keep data replicas in Cassandra consistent, but it isn't the only method."
    - content: "All of the above"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! Cassandra uses all three methods as mechanisms to keep data replicas consistent."

# Did I Get This block 2 question 3
  - content: "An application is using the **ONE** consistency model for reads and the **ALL** consistency model for writes. In this mode, Cassandra will offer the application:"
    choices:
    - content: "Strong consistency"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! Using the _W_ + _R_ > _N_ formula, where _W_ = 1 and _R_ = _N_, the system is strongly consistent for this application."
    - content: "Weak consistency"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Apply the _W_ + _R_ > _N_ formula and see if the read and write models read at least all of the replicas of the data item."      

# Did I Get This block 2 question 4
  - content: "Which of the following consistency models are offered in Cassandra for **read** operations?"
    choices:
    - content: "ONE, QUORUM, ALL"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct!"
    - content: "ZERO, QUORUM, ALL"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect."
    - content: "ZERO, ANY, ONE, QUORUM, ALL"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect."
    - content: "ANY, QUORUM, ALL"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect."
