  questions:

# Did I Get This block 1
  - content: "What is an RDD?"
    choices:
    - content: "Distributed collection of objects on disk"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Think of the different ways RDDs can be persisted."
    - content: "Distributed collection of objects in memory"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Think of the different ways RDDs can be persisted."
    - content: "Distributed collection of objects in Cassandra"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Think of the different ways RDDs can be persisted."
    - content: "All of the above"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct!"

# Did I Get This block 2
  - content: "Compare the data-loss fault-tolerance mechanisms of Spark and Hadoop for a long computation:"
    choices:
    - content: "Spark fault tolerance is **more** costly to implement. Spark node failure is **more** costly to recover from."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Spark uses lineage for fault tolerance. Hadoop uses replication of blocks on HDFS."
    - content: "Spark fault tolerance is **less** costly to implement. Spark node failure is **less** costly to recover from."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Spark uses lineage for fault tolerance. Hadoop uses replication of blocks on HDFS."
    - content: "Spark fault tolerance is **more** costly to implement. Spark node failure is **less** costly to recover from."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Spark uses lineage for fault tolerance. Hadoop uses replication of blocks on HDFS."
    - content: "Spark fault tolerance is **less** costly to implement. Spark node failure is **more** costly to recover from."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct!"
