abstract: | 
  In this module, you will:
    - Recall the features of an iterative programming framework
    - Describe the architecture and job flow in Spark
    - Recall the role of resilient distributed datasets (RDDs) in Spark
    - Describe the properties of RDDs in Spark
    - Compare and contrast RDDs with distributed shared-memory systems
    - Describe fault-tolerance mechanics in Spark
    - Describe the role of lineage in RDDs for fault tolerance and recovery
    - Understand the different types of dependencies between RDDs
    - Understand the basic operations on Spark RDDs
    - Step through a simple iterative Spark program
    - Recall the various Spark libraries and their functions
  
  In partnership with Dr. Majd Sakr and Carnegie Mellon University.
