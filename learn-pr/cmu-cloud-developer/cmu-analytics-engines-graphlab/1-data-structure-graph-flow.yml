      Complete the following sentences: <br><br>
      Graph-parallel problems assume problems are modeled as ____________.<br>
      Computation in GraphLab is represented as ____________.<br>
      Data dependencies or communications are represented as ____________.
    choices:
    - content: "graphs, vertices, edges"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! GraphLab assumes problems are modeled as graphs. Computation is represented as vertices. Data dependencies or communications are represented as edges."
    - content: "threads, edges, vertices"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. GraphLab problems aren't explicitly modeled as threads. Computation isn't represented as edges. Data dependencies or communications aren't represented as vertices."
    - content: "tasks, vertices, edges"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. GraphLab problems aren't modeled as tasks."
    - content: "threads, vertices, edges"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. GraphLab problems aren't modeled as threads."

# Did I Get This block question 2      
  - content: "What does atom generation entail?"
    choices:
    - content: "A graph is partitioned into individual atoms, which are encoded by using some form of binary representation."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The atoms are not directly encoded in some binary format."
    - content: "An atom consists of the actual vertices and edges that belong to a particular partition, which are stored as an adjacency matrix."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Graphs are not represented using an adjacency matrix in GraphLab."
    - content: "A graph is partitioned into individual atoms and is self-contained with instructions on how to generate the vertices and edges that belong to that partition."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! An atom in GraphLab is written using the **journal** format, which makes atoms self-contained and easy to manipulate to reflect changes in the graph structure. Thus graphs do not require repartitioning in GraphLab if any changes are made."
    - content: "A graph is stored in its entirety as an atom and stored on a distributed file system."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The graph needs to be partitioned and distributed among several nodes in the cluster."

# Did I Get This block question 3      
  - content: "What does partition generation entail?"
    choices:
    - content: "A graph is partitioned based on the definitions in the atom index file."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The atom index is merely a map of the partitions contained in each atom. The partitions can be generated from each atom file."
    - content: "A graph adjacency matrix is equally partitioned among nodes in the cluster."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. GraphLab does not use adjacency matrices to represent graphs or partitions."
    - content: "The commands in an atom's journal are played to generate the partition associated with an atom."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! The atom is formatted as a journal, which contains the commands to generate a partition."

      Assume the following graph: <br><br>
      <img src=./media/quiz-units-2-and-4-vertices-graph.png></img> <br><br>
      Assume that the scope of a vertex $v$ in this graph is defined as the immediate neighboring vertices of $v$. <br>
      Which vertices have the largest scope?
    choices:
    - content: "$V_{5}$"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. V<sub>5</sub> has a scope of 1."
    - content: "$V_{2}$ and $V_{4}$"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. V<sub>2</sub> and V<sub>4</sub> each have a scope of 2."
    - content: "$V_{1}$ and $V_{3}$"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! V<sub>1</sub> and V<sub>3</sub> each have a scope of 3."
    - content: "$V_{6}$"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. V<sub>6</sub> has a scope of 1."

# Did I Get This block question 5     
  - content: "Assume a graph partitioning strategy simply divided up a graph vertex-wise, and sends individual vertices (along with their neighboring edges and ghost vertices) to individual machines in a cluster. In which of the following cases will this strategy be suboptimal in terms of work distributed among the machines in a cluster?"
    choices:
    - content: "Graphs with a heavily skewed distribution of edges to vertices"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! Such graphs will result in some vertices having a large number of edges, which means the machines assigned to process these vertices will be heavily loaded compared to other machines."
    - content: "Graphs with directed edges"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Which of the scenarios above results in a skewed distribution of work per machine in a cluster?"
    - content: "Graphs with a very large number (> 1 million) of edges"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Which of the scenarios above results in a skewed distribution of work per machine in a cluster?"    
    - content: "Graphs with a very large number (> 1 million) of vertices"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Which of the scenarios above results in a skewed distribution of work per machine in a cluster?"
