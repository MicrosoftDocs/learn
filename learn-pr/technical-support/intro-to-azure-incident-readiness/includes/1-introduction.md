Microsoft categorizes cloud incidents into three types: service incidents, privacy incidents, and security incidents.

A service incident is an event or a series of events that can cause an interruption or degraded experience for customers using one or more of Microsoft's services. These incidents are effectively unplanned downtime including outages impacting availability, performance degradation impacting users, and problems interfering with service administration/management.

Security incidents are a confirmed breach that leads to destruction, loss, or unauthorized disclosure of customer data, or access to customer or personal data while being processed by Microsoft. Privacy incidents pertain to potential unauthorized use or disclosure of customer data.
