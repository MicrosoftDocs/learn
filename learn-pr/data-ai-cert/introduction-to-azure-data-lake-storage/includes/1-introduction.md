Many organizations have spent the last two decades building data warehouses and business intelligence (BI) solutions based on relational database systems. Many BI solutions have lost out on opportunities to store unstructured data due to cost and complexity in these types of data in databases.

Data lakes have become a common solution to this problem. A data lake provides file-based storage, usually in a distributed file system that supports high scalability for massive volumes of data. Organizations can store structured, semi-structured, and unstructured files in the data lake and then consume them from there in big data processing technologies, such as Apache Spark.

Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 provides a cloud-based solution for data lake storage in Microsoft Azure, and underpins many large-scale analytics solutions built on Azure.
