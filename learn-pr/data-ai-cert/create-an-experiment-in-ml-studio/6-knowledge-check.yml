  title: Check your knowledge - Create an experiment  
  questions: 
  - content: "You're trying to set up a web service for your experiment, but the button isn't available. Why?"
    choices:
    - content: "You can't publish this type of experiment as a web service. Instead, publish the experiment as an Azure function."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "In Machine Learning Studio, you can publish experiments as web services, not Azure functions."
    - content: "You need to run the experiment."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "If you haven't run the experiment or if you come back to the experiment after you've signed out, you must run the experiment and get the green check marks that indicate satisfactory completion."
    - content: "You didn't create a virtual machine to host the web service."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Machine Learning Studio doesn't require you to create a virtual machine to host the web service for an experiment."
  - content: "To test the web service with a client application, what do you need to add to the sample code?"
    choices:
    - content: "The API key."
      isCorrect: true

    - content: "The experiment name. Add this name in the JSON code that's generated in the sample app."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "You don't have to add the experiment name to the generated JSON code."
