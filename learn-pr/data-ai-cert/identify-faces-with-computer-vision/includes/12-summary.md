We've covered quite a bit of information about face recognition and emotion. You can use the testing web interface to learn how the calls to the API work. Also consider using a client application to work through the concepts. Try this [C# tutorial with a sample starter application](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/computer-vision/tutorials/csharptutorial).

Face detection is just one part of the overall Vision API in Azure Cognitive Services. Use it in your applications to take advantage of the facial recognition capabilities that Microsoft provides. If the built-in functionality doesn't match your needs completely, use data science to create your own facial recognition services, or use the custom vision capabilities.

## Cleanup

To avoid any unexpected costs in your Azure account, delete the **mslearn-faceapi** resource group to remove all of the resources we created in this module. Here are the steps:

1. To quickly find the **mslearn-faceapi** resource group, on the Azure sidebar, select **Resource groups**.

1. Select the resource group, and open the context menu by either right-clicking the row or selecting the **...** button on the right side of the row.

1. Select **Delete resource group**.

1. Type the name of the resource group and select **Delete**. Azure deprovisions all of the resources for you.
