  questions:
  - content: "Which step below is not part of using AutoML?"
    choices: 
    - content: "Define the machine learning objective and constraints."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This is correct. Hyperparameters control how the model training executes and must be set before model training."
    - content: "Launch the AutoML process."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That is not correct. Hyperparameters cannot be determined from the source data."
    - content: "Deploy the model."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "This is not correct.  A Hyperparameter is set before each model training execution."
  
  - content: "Which service below is not included as part of AutoML?"
    choices: 
    - content: "Data preparation"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That is correct.  Data preparation should be done prior to using AutoML."
    - content: "Machine learning model recommendation"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That is not correct.  AutoML supports automation evaluation of models and recommendation of the best one to use."
    - content: "Hyperparameter tuning"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That is correct.  AutoML supports automatics hyperparameter tuning which is covered in detail in another module."

  - content: "One of the AutoMLConfig settings is primary_metric.  Which of the following values is not a valid value for this setting?"
    choices: 
    - content: "bayesian_correlation"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That is correct.  bayesian_correlation is not a valid value."
    - content: "normalized_root_mean_squared_error"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That is not correct.  normalized_root_mean_squared_error is a valid value."
    - content: "spearman_correlation"
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: "That is not correct.  spearman_correlation is a valid value."
