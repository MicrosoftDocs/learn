  questions:

  - content: "Which of the following is not a specialized role in the Data Science Process?"
    choices: 
    - content: "Database Administrator"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct.  This is not a specialist role in the data science process."
    - content: "Data Scientist"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This is not correct.  A Data Scientist focuses on machine learning model training and evaluation."
    - content: "Data Engineer"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This is not correct.  The Data Engineer prepares the data to be used in machine learning model training."

  - content: "Model feature engineering refers to which of the following?"
    choices: 
    - content: "Selecting the best model to use for the experiment."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This is not correct.  Selecting the best model is a different step in the Data Science Process."
    - content: "Determine which data elements will help in making a prediction and preparing these columns to be used in model training."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "This is correct.  Feature engineering involves the data scientist determining which data to use in model training and preparing the data so it can be used by the model."
    - content: "Exploring the data to understand it better."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This is not correct.  While Exploratory Data Analysis is a valuable part of the process, it is best done before feature engineering."

  - content: "The Model deployment involves."
    choices: 
    - content: "Calling a model to score new data."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This is not correct.  Scoring data is not the same as deploying the model to where it will be used."
    - content: "Training a model."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This is not correct.  Training the model is a step done before deploying it to where it will be consumed."
    - content: "Copying a trained model and its code dependencies to an environment where it will be used to score new data."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "This is correct.  Deploying a model makes it available for use."
