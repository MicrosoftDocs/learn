Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 is an enterprise data lake solution designed to run large-scale analytical workloads in the cloud. It takes core capabilities from Azure Data Lake Storage Gen1, including security, scale, and file system semantics. It combines these capabilities with the low cost and high availability of Azure Blob storage.
