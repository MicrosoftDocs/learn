  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:

  - content: "You are working on a project with a 3rd party vendor to build a website for a customer. The image assets that will be used on the website are stored in an Azure Storage account that is held in your subscription. You want to give read access to this data for a limited period of time. What security option would be the best option to use?"
    choices: 
    - content: "CORS Support"

      explanation: "CORS uses HTTP headers so that a web application at one domain can access resources from a server at a different domain."
    - content: "Storage Account"

    - content: "Shared Access Signatures"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct.  A shared access signature is a string that contains a security token that can be attached to a URI. Use a shared access signature to delegate access to storage objects and specify constraints, such as the permissions and the time range of access."

      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Azure Storage Account Security Feature does not exist. Microsoft Defender for Storage detects anomalies in account activity. It then notifies you of potentially harmful attempts to access your account."
    - content: "Encryption in transit"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Encryption in transit uses security algorithms to protect data on the network. Microsoft Defender for Storage detects anomalies in account activity. It then notifies you of potentially harmful attempts to access your account."
