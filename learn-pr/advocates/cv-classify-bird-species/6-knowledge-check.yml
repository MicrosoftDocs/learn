  title: Answer the following questions to check your understanding.
  questions:
    - content: "What is the purpose of artificial intelligence?"
      choices:
        - content: "To build Skynet."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. Skynet is a fictional artificial intelligence system that's featured in a movie."
        - content: "To mimic human intelligence by using a computer."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct!"
    - content: "Which of the following options *isn't* an indicator that Custom Vision provides to help you understand how well a machine learning model performs?"
      choices:
        - content: "A confusion matrix"
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct! A confusion matrix is a valid metric, but it isn't provided by Azure AI Custom Vision."
        - content: "Recall"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. The recall metric is provided."
        - content: "Average precision, or AP"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. The AP metric is provided."
        - content: "Precision"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. The precision metric is provided."
    - content: "What's a common beginner's mistake when using machine learning models?"
      choices:
        - content: "Using bad data."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct! Good data is key to making a good machine learning model."
        - content: "Using too much data."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. More data is better, if the data is good data."
        - content: "Using unseen (new) data to test."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. You always want to test by using data the model hasn't seen before."
    - content: "The model shouldn't be deployed until it has perfect results and is 100% accurate on all classes."
      choices:
        - content: "False"
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct! You must decide when the model performs at a satisfactory level for the problem you're trying to solve."
        - content: "True"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. There's always some error in models. Machine learning models will never be perfect."
