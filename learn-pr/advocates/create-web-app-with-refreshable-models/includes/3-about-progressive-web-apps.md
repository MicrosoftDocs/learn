## What is a Progressive Web App, or PWA?

A Progressive Web App is a web site that looks and behaves as if it's a mobile app. That means it works offline, might use push notifications, and has access to hardware such as bluetooth and cameras. For this app, you can use Progressive Web App functionality to ensure that your app can work both offline and online. You can accomplish this task by ensuring that all the files that are needed by the app are available during the build process. In addition, you can make sure that no online API calls are needed to access its machine learning model.
