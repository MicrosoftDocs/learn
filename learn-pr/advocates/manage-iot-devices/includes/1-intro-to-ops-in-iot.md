<!--Video script: It began with Personal Digital Assistants, then smartphones and now everything from smart watches to smart thermostats are connecting people with more information than ever before. Once limited to just PCs, the Internet now allows anything that has valuable information to go online. How does this trend have the potential to impact all aspects of IT professional’s role? More importantly, how can IT professionals prepare for the Internet of Things?-->

Improving your hard skills is just one of the steps necessary for success in
this changing technological landscape. Gone are the days of getting years
between new product releases as the Internet of Things (IoT) allows for sweeping
changes across industries. IT Administrators will be required to possibly prepare
quarterly, if not more frequent, updates to all company assets connected to
their network.

The amount of data that the Internet of Things can capture will create a unique
opportunity for IT Operations. Businesses will be looking to IT Ops to help them
understand what data to collect and help them unleash the full potential of that
data. As an example, IoT can be harnessed to capture and run predictive
analytics on data from heart monitors alerting users when they’re at risk of a
heart episode. These same heart monitors could possibly collect information
enabling doctors to make more informed treatment plans for their patients.

The entry IoT opportunity for IT Operations is data management. Taking the time to update your network knowledge and skills could enable your organization to understand the IT Operations role in addressing data linkages from IoT devices. Data management positions are already in high demand and the need for experienced data management professionals will increase as more companies deploy Internet of Things solutions.

Internet of Things has created virtually unlimited possibilities across all
industries, not just a select few. IoT will lead to unprecedented opportunities
for any IT professional willing to embrace the technology and become an
authority in it.

 The rest of this module will take this foundational knowledge of IoT and apply it to a real world scenario. You will be interacting with and online Raspberry Pi simulator to capture simulated weather data via the Azure IoT Hub.
