  questions:
    - content: "Which of the following features isn't a main Redis use case?"
      choices:
        - content: "Distributed cache."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. Distributed caching is one of the main use cases for Azure Cache for Redis."
        - content: "HTTP session data store."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. Storing HTTP session data is one of the main use cases for Azure Cache for Redis."
        - content: "Message broker."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. Message brokering is one of the main use cases for Azure Cache for Redis."
        - content: "Geo-replication."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct. The Premium and Enterprise SKUs of Azure Cache for Redis offer this feature, but it's not a main Redis use case."
    - content: "How does Azure Cache for Redis scale out a web application?"
      choices:
        - content: "Uses IP multicast to find other application nodes and share data among them."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. Some caching solutions use this mechanism, but it doesn't work well in a cloud environment."
        - content: "Acts as a central and scalable data store, where all application nodes can store and retrieve cached data."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct. All nodes can store and retrieve data at scale by connecting to Azure Cache for Redis."
        - content: "Sends messages to every application node to invalidate stale data, so the nodes can then retrieve that data from a persistent database."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. Some alternative caching solutions use this mechanism, but Azure Cache for Redis doesn't."
        - content: "Stores cached data in an SQL database, so that application nodes can retrieve it easily."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. Spring Session can use an SQL database to store data as an alternative, but that's a less effective solution than Azure Cache for Redis."
    - content: "What's the difference between Redis and Azure Cache for Redis?"
      choices:
        - content: "Azure Cache for Redis is a limited version of Redis that focuses only on caching."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. Azure Cache for Redis is a full-featured version of Redis."
        - content: "Azure Cache for Redis is an Azure Cosmos DB database that's compatible with the Redis API."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. Azure Cache for Redis is based on the real Redis software."
        - content: "Azure Cache for Redis is a managed, cloud-based version of Redis."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct. Azure Cache for Redis is a managed, cloud-based version of Redis that Azure maintains and operates."
