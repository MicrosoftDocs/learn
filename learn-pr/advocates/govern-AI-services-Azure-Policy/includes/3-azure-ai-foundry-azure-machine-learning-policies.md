Azure AI Foundry and Azure Machine Learning (ML) share the same resource ID type assignment and as a result they share the same policy definitions. Azure AI Foundry uses the concepts of Hubs while Azure Machine Learning uses workspaces, however they both lie under the Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces resource ID.

While cross-compatible, Microsoft provides built-in policies for both services. Below is the list of built-in policies you can apply to Azure Machine Learning directly from the Azure portal:

| **Name** | **Description** |
|---|---|
| **[Preview]: Azure Machine Learning Deployments should only use approved Registry Models** | Restrict the deployment of Registry models to control externally created models used within your organization |
| **[Preview]: Azure Machine Learning Model Registry Deployments are restricted except for the allowed Registry** | Only deploy Registry Models in the allowed Registry and that aren't restricted. |
| **Azure Machine Learning and AI Studio should use Allow Only Approved Outbound Managed Vnet mode** | Managed VNet isolation streamlines and automates your network isolation configuration with a built-in, workspace-level Azure Machine Learning managed VNet. The managed VNet secures your managed Azure Machine Learning resources, such as compute instances, compute clusters, serverless compute, and managed online endpoints. |
| **Azure Machine Learning Compute Instance should have idle shutdown.** | Having an idle shutdown schedule reduces cost by shutting down computes that are idle after a predetermined period of activity. |
| **Azure Machine Learning compute instances should be recreated to get the latest software updates** | Ensure Azure Machine Learning compute instances run on the latest available operating system. Security is improved and vulnerabilities reduced by running with the latest security patches. |
| **Azure Machine Learning Computes should be in a virtual network** | Azure Virtual Networks provide enhanced security and isolation for your Azure Machine Learning Compute Clusters and Instances, as well as subnets, access control policies, and other features to further restrict access. When a compute is configured with a virtual network, it isn't publicly addressable and can only be accessed from virtual machines and applications within the virtual network. |
| **Azure Machine Learning Computes should have local authentication methods disabled** | Disabling local authentication methods improves security by ensuring that Machine Learning Computes require Microsoft Entra identities exclusively for authentication. |
| **Azure Machine Learning workspaces should be encrypted with a customer-managed key** | Manage encryption at rest of Azure Machine Learning workspace data with customer-managed keys. By default, customer data is encrypted with service-managed keys, but customer-managed keys are commonly required to meet regulatory compliance standards. Customer-managed keys enable the data to be encrypted with an Azure Key Vault key created and owned by you. You have full control and responsibility for the key lifecycle, including rotation and management. |
| **Azure Machine Learning Workspaces should disable public network access** | Disabling public network access improves security by ensuring that the Machine Learning Workspaces aren't exposed on the public internet. You can control exposure of your workspaces by creating private endpoints instead. |
| **Azure Machine Learning workspaces should enable V1LegacyMode to support network isolation backward compatibility** | Azure Machine Learning is making a transition to a new V2 API platform on Azure Resource Manager and you can control API platform version using V1LegacyMode parameter. Enabling the V1LegacyMode parameter will enable you to keep your workspaces in the same network isolation as V1, though you won't have use of the new V2 features. We recommend turning on V1 Legacy Mode only when you want to keep the Azure Machine Learning control plane data inside your private networks. |
| **Azure Machine Learning workspaces should use private link** | Azure Private Link lets you connect your virtual network to Azure services without a public IP address at the source or destination. The Private Link platform handles the connectivity between the consumer and services over the Azure backbone network. By mapping private endpoints to Azure Machine Learning workspaces, data leakage risks are reduced. |
| **Azure Machine Learning workspaces should use user-assigned managed identity** | Manage access to Azure Machine Learning workspace and associated resources, Azure Container Registry, KeyVault, Storage, and App Insights using user-assigned managed identity. By default, system-assigned managed identity is used by Azure Machine Learning workspace to access the associated resources. User-assigned managed identity allows you to create the identity as an Azure resource and maintain the life cycle of that identity. |
| **Configure Azure Machine Learning Computes to disable local authentication methods** | Disable location authentication methods so that your Machine Learning Computes require Microsoft Entra identities exclusively for authentication. |
| **Configure Azure Machine Learning workspace to use private DNS zones** | Use private DNS zones to override the DNS resolution for a private endpoint. A private DNS zone links to your virtual network to resolve to Azure Machine Learning workspaces. |
| **Configure Azure Machine Learning Workspaces to disable public network access** | Disable public network access for Azure Machine Learning Workspaces so that your workspaces aren't accessible over the public internet. This helps protect the workspaces against data leakage risks. You can control exposure of your workspaces by creating private endpoints instead. |
| **Configure Azure Machine Learning workspaces with private endpoints** | Private endpoints connect your virtual network to Azure services without a public IP address at the source or destination. By mapping private endpoints to your Azure Machine Learning workspace, you can reduce data leakage risks. |
| **Configure diagnostic settings for Azure Machine Learning Workspaces to Log Analytics workspace** | Deploys the diagnostic settings for Azure Machine Learning Workspaces to stream resource logs to a Log Analytics Workspace when any Azure Machine Learning Workspace which is missing this diagnostic settings is created or updated. |
| **Resource logs in Azure Machine Learning Workspaces should be enabled** | Resource logs enable recreating activity trails to use for investigation purposes when a security incident occurs or when your network is compromised. |

| **Hubs should be encrypted with a customer-managed key** | Manage encryption at rest of data with customer-managed keys. By default, customer data is encrypted with service-managed keys, but customer-managed keys are commonly required to meet regulatory compliance standards. Customer-managed keys enable the data to be encrypted with an Azure Key Vault key created and owned by you. You have full control and responsibility for the key lifecycle, including rotation and management. |
| **Hubs should disable public network access** | Disabling public network access improves security by ensuring that hubs and projects aren't exposed on the public internet. You can control exposure of your workspaces by creating private endpoints instead. |
| **Hubs should use private link** | Azure Private Link lets you connect your virtual network to Azure services without a public IP address at the source or destination. The Private Link platform handles the connectivity between the consumer and services over the Azure backbone network. By mapping private endpoints to hubs, data leakage risks are reduced. |
| **Hubs should use user-assigned managed identity** | Manage access to hubs and associated resources, Azure Container Registry, KeyVault, Storage, and App Insights using user-assigned managed identity.
