Most people that work at an organization are unlikely to be generative AI specialists. This means that part of the role of a generative AI CoE is to ensure that the appropriate resources exist for nonspecialists to understand and be able to leverage generative AI applications to perform their organizational roles.

By having personnel and resources available within an organization through a generative AI CoE, organizations can ensure that they can address skill gaps and provide targeted learning pathways, hands-on training, structured resources, and ongoing support to those using generative AI tools. 

A generative AI CoE can ensure that structured roadmaps that guide learning from foundational to advanced levels, including progress tracking, certifications, and practical project applications are available and easy for staff to consume. 

By creating and commissioning resources that integrate generative AI tools into daily workflows, the generative AI CoE is able to accelerate learning and adoption, supporting organizational productivity through automation, workflow optimization, and improved efficiency. 

A successful generative AI CoE plays a key role in helping teams adopt AI technologies in a way that brings tangible benefits to the organization as a whole. By having a centralized body responsible for providing these resources, the organization enhances its readiness, ensures continuous growth, and unlocks new opportunities for innovation and measurable business impact.
