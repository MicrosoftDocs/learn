Most people that work at an organization are unlikely to be AI specialists. This means that part of the role of a AI CoE is to ensure that the appropriate resources exist for nonspecialists to understand and be able to leverage AI applications to perform their organizational roles.

By having personnel and resources available within an organization through a AI CoE, organizations can ensure that they can address skill gaps and provide targeted learning pathways, hands-on training, structured resources, and ongoing support to those using AI tools. 

A AI CoE can ensure that structured roadmaps that guide learning from foundational to advanced levels, including progress tracking, certifications, and practical project applications are available and easy for staff to consume. 

By creating and commissioning resources that integrate AI tools into daily workflows, the AI CoE is able to accelerate learning and adoption, supporting organizational productivity through automation, workflow optimization, and improved efficiency. 

A successful AI CoE plays a key role in helping teams adopt AI technologies in a way that brings tangible benefits to the organization as a whole. By having a centralized body responsible for providing these resources, the organization enhances its readiness, ensures continuous growth, and unlocks new opportunities for innovation and measurable business impact.
