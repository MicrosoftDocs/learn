A generative AI CoE is a collection of people and resources that help an organization adopt generative AI. It helps define an organization's strategy, determining and establishing an organization's best practices for generative AI, and acts as an organization's generative AI adoption knowledge and skilling hub.

## What are the functions of a generative AI CoE?

A generative AI CoE typically focuses on setting direction, defining strategies, providing support, establishing metrics, and monitoring the impact of generative AI initiatives. A generative AI CoE provides an organization with a central location and set of people that have the knowledge, skills, and capabilities to effectively leverage AI. When properly implemented, a generative AI CoE holds the authority and influence within an organization needed to drive adoption of generative AI solutions. 

A generative AI CoE assists an organization with:

- Determining business use cases for generative AI applications.
- Organizational generative AI readiness and driving adoption.
- Developing generative AI skilling resources.
- Identifying roles required for generative AI adoption and success.
- Ensuring that generative AI workloads are governed responsibly and are compliant.
- Ensuring that generative AI workloads meet operations and security best practices.

## Tailoring a generative AI CoE to your organization's needs

When designing and implementing a generative AI CoE, consider the following questions:

- Should the generative AI CoE concentrate on technical and operational aspects, on strategy and business alignment, or adopt an integrated approach?
- Should the CoE focus on execution responsibilities like developing LLM models or serve as a guiding body, setting principles and frameworks?
- Should the organization create an independent team associated with the CoE or can the necessary generative AI expertise be embedded within existing teams?
- Should the CoE operate as a centralized entity, a decentralized network, or a hybrid model?
- Which staff should be part of the CoE to ensure its effectiveness?
- Should the CoE primarily serve internal teams, support external clients, or focus on partners and ecosystem collaboration?
- If the CoE is internally focused, does it also deliver AI services to the market as part of the organization's business model, or is it strictly enabled for internal AI adoption?

Choosing the right organizational model depends on several factors. A CoE will always require some level of centralization to support governance, best practices, and alignment across all generative AI initiatives. However, execution is often decentralized, especially in larger organizations or industries where AI adoption varies across departments.

Organizations needing greater control, compliance, and standardization might prefer a centralized model. In contrast, more distributed organizations, where business units operate independently, may opt for a hybrid approach, with the CoE providing strategic oversight while allowing departmental or regional execution.

Small and medium enterprises may choose to start small and then scale. This allows those enterprises to focus on specific use cases where generative AI can immediately add business value. Small and medium enterprises may even partner with consultants to implement a virtual generative AI CoE if expertise isn't available within the organization itself.
