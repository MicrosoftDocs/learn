  questions:

  - content: What does the Spherical Mercator projection coordinate system do to a map?
    choices:  
    - content: Makes it round.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. The Spherical Mercator projection coordinate system changes the shape of a map, but it doesn't make it round.
    - content: Colors it in green and blue.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. The Spherical Mercator projection coordinate system doesn't affect the color of a map.
    - content: Stretches the map at the poles.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct! The Spherical Mercator projection coordinate system stretches the map at both the North Pole and the South Pole. This stretching makes a square map that can be rendered on a flat screen.
    
  - content: What do heat map layers show?
    choices:
    - content: The density of data, by using a range of colors.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct! Heat map layers represent data density. Heat map layers use a range of colors to show 'hot spot' areas on a map.
    - content: The current temperature of the planet.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. Heat map layers don't literally represent heat or temperature.
    - content: How high above sea level a location is.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. Heat map layers don't represent the altitude of locations or features on a map.

  - content: What GeoJSON object is used to render a layer on a map?
    choices:  
    - content: Geometry
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. A geometry isn't used to render layers on a map.
    - content: Feature
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. A feature isn't used to render layers on a map.
    - content: Feature collection
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct! Azure Maps uses data sources that contain GeoJSON feature collections to render layers on the map.

  - content: How can you get the coordinates of the part of a map that's visible in a web browser?
    choices:
    - content: Get the bounds property from the Maps camera.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct! A virtual camera controls the viewable area of a map. The camera has a bounds property that defines the north-west and south-east corners of the visible map.
    - content: Get the top, bottom, left, and right coordinates from the map control.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. The map control doesn't contain the information you need to get the coordinates of a map that's shown in a web browser.
    - content: Calculate based on the last known location.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. Azure Maps offers a direct way to get the coordinates of a map that's shown in a web browser.
