Many enterprises, such as purchase management, manufacturing, and customer relationship management use Java EE applications.

Take the example of a freight-delivery system:

- Your service receives a package, captures the shipping address information, and registers the delivery address.
- Your service queries and updates data from a relational database.

In a similar way, in this module, you'll create a database on Azure Database for MySQL. You'll then create and deploy a Java EE (Jakarta EE) application to JBoss EAP on Azure App Service. Finally, you'll learn how to manage your application's life cycle.

## Learning objectives

By the end of this module, you'll be able to:

- Create and manage Azure Database for MySQL.
- Deploy a Java EE app to JBoss EAP on Azure App Service.
- Create a data source and bind your Java EE app to MySQL.
- Access and manage the Java EE app on JBoss.
