In this exercise, you access the JBoss administration tools and stream the application logs.

## Set up environment variables

For this exercise, you need some environment variables from prior exercises. If you're using the same Bash window, these variables should still exist. If the variables are no longer available, use the following commands to recreate them. Be sure to replace the <...> placeholders with your own values, and use the same values that you used previously.

```bash
export RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME=<resource-group>
export WEB_APP_NAME=<app-name>
```

## Create a TCP tunnel

To access the remote server, create a TCP tunnel between your remote server and your local machine by using the following command:

```azurecli
az webapp create-remote-connection \
    --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME} \
    --name ${WEB_APP_NAME}
```
The output contains the TCP tunnel port number, username, and password. Be sure to save aside this information for later use.

## Sign in by using SSH and the TCP tunnel

To sign in to the server using SSH and a TCP tunnel, use the following steps:

1. Open a new command terminal.

1. Sign in to the server by using the following commands. Be sure to replace the `<port-number>` placeholder with the port number you retrieved in the previous section.

    ```bash
    export PORT_NUMBER=<port-number>
    ssh root@127.0.0.1 -L 9990:localhost:9990 -p $PORT_NUMBER
    ```

    > [!TIP]
    > If you want to access to the JBoss EAP admin web console, specify the `-L 9990:localhost:9990` option. Then, access the JBoss web console at `http://localhost:9990/console`. If you don't need to sign in to the JBoss web console, you can remove the `-L` option.

    The following output is typical:

    ```output
    ssh root@127.0.0.1 -L 9990:localhost:9990 -p 65171
    root@127.0.0.1's password:
    Last login: Tue Feb 25 07:44:49 2025 from 169.254.129.2

    **NOTE**: No files or system changes outside of /home will persist beyond your application's current session. /home is your application's persistent storage and is shared across all the server instances.
    ```

## Run the JBoss CLI tool

After you sign in to the remote server, you can run the JBoss EAP admin CLI tool, **/opt/eap/bin/jboss-cli.sh**, by using the following steps:

1. Connect to JBoss EAP by using the following command:

    ```bash
    /opt/eap/bin/jboss-cli.sh --connect
    ```

    The following output is typical:

    ```output
    OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM warning: Options -Xverify:none and -noverify were deprecated in JDK 13 and will likely be removed in a future release.
    ```

1. After you connect to the JBoss EAP Server, use the following command at the JBoss prompt to get the JBoss server information:

    ```JBoss
    product-info
    ```

    The following output is typical:

    ```output
    {
        "outcome" => "success",
        "result" => [{"summary" => {
            "host-name" => "jakartaee-aaaabbbb",
            "instance-identifier" => "aaaaaaaa-1111-bbbb-2222-cccccccccccc",
            "product-name" => "JBoss EAP",
            "product-version" => "8.0 Update 4.1",
            "product-community-identifier" => "Product",
            "product-home" => "/opt/eap",
            "standalone-or-domain-identifier" => "STANDALONE_SERVER",
            "host-operating-system" => "Ubuntu 22.04.5 LTS",
            "host-cpu" => {
                "host-cpu-arch" => "amd64",
                "host-core-count" => 2
            },
            "jvm" => {
                "name" => "OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM",
                "java-version" => "17",
                "jvm-version" => "17.0.13",
                "jvm-vendor" => "Microsoft",
                "java-home" => "/usr/lib/jvm/msopenjdk-17-amd64"
            }
        }}]
    }
    ```

1. Use the following command to list all of the deployed applications:

    ```JBoss
    ls deployment
    ```

    The following output is typical:

    ```output
    ROOT.war
    ```

1. Test the database connection by using the following command:

    ```JBoss
    /subsystem=datasources/data-source="JPAWorldDataSourceDS":test-connection-in-pool
    ```

    The following output is typical:

    ```output
    {
        "outcome" => "success",
        "result" => [true]
    }
    ```

1. Exit from the JBoss EAP CLI by using the following command:

    ```JBoss
    exit
    ```

## Access the JBoss EAP admin web console

Next, access the JBoss admin web console by using the following steps:

1. Create an admin user and password for authentication by using the following command:

    ```bash
    /opt/eap/bin/add-user.sh -u admin -p admin -r ManagementRealm
    ```

    The following output is typical:

    ```output
    Picked up JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS: -Xmx5480M -Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true
    Updated user 'admin' to file '/opt/eap/standalone/configuration/mgmt-users.properties'
    Updated user 'admin' to file '/opt/eap/domain/configuration/mgmt-users.properties'
    ```

1. Access the web console from a web browser in your local environment by using `http://127.0.0.1:9990/console`.

1. In the authentication dialog box, sign in with the previously created username and password.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/jboss-admin-console-authentication.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the authentication dialog box for the admin console." lightbox="../media/jboss-admin-console-authentication.png":::

    After you sign in to the web console, the following screen appears:

    :::image type="content" source="../media/jboss-admin-console-home-page.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the main page of the admin console." lightbox="../media/jboss-admin-console-home-page.png":::

1. Confirm that you created the datasource by selecting **Configuration** > **Subsystems** > **Datasources & Drivers** > **Datasources**.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/jboss-admin-console-configuration.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the list of data sources on the admin console." lightbox="../media/jboss-admin-console-configuration.png":::

1. You can also confirm the RESTful endpoints of your application by selecting **Runtime** > **\<your-system\>** > **JAX-RS** > **\<your-application\>**.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/jboss-admin-console-runtime.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the RESTful endpoints on the admin console." lightbox="../media/jboss-admin-console-runtime.png":::

    > [!WARNING]
    > If you directly access the remote server via the JBoss CLI command or web console and add or update a configuration, the configuration is cleared and deleted after the Azure App Service instance is restarted. To persist the configuration, use a startup script such as the **createMySQLDataSource.sh** script used in a previous unit.

## Open a log stream

Access the logs by using the following command:

```azurecli
az webapp log tail \
    --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME} \
    --name ${WEB_APP_NAME}
```

The following output is typical:

```output

## Exercise summary

In this unit, you learned how to configure and deploy a Jakarta EE 10 application to JBoss EAP on Azure App Service. Then, you used a `DataSource` object for connecting MySQL to JBoss EAP in a startup script.

You also learned how to access the remote server from both the CLI and the graphical user interface (GUI) by using a TCP tunnel. Finally, you accessed the log file from a local machine.
