      choices:
        - content: "Enhanced Security"
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Managed identities eliminate the need to store credentials within application code, reducing the risk of credential leaks. They use Entra for authentication, providing a more secure and automated method for accessing Azure services."
        - content: "Increased Performance"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "While managed identities improve security, they don't inherently increase application performance."
        - content: "Cost Reduction"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Managed identities don't directly impact the cost of Azure services; their primary benefit is enhanced security."
