    - content: Instructions that guide the user's input.
      isCorrect: true

    - content: Data about the current conversation context.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect: The system message can include some contextual data to help the AI understand how to respond in line with past interactions."
    - content: Restrictions or limitations for the AI's response.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect: The system message often contains restrictions that limit the types of responses the AI can provide, ensuring it follows specific rules or avoids certain topics."
    - content: Information that sets the behavior of the AI.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect: The system message typically includes information that sets the AI's behavior, such as its personality or specific guidelines for how it should respond."
  - content: For Azure OpenAI model deployments, what is the threshold level for the default content filter?
    choices:
    - content: High.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'Incorrect: A content filter can only be set to "high" by creating a custom content filter.'

      explanation: "Incorrect: A content filter can only be set to low by creating a custom content filter."
    - content: No detection.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect: Although content filters can be turned off with approval, the threshold 'no detection' isn't an actual level."
  - content: What is the view for comparing automated evaluation results, enabling you to visualize the delta and/or only showing differences?
    choices:
    - content: Compare view.
      isCorrect: false

    - content: List view.
      isCorrect: false

    - content: Dashboard view.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct: You can select the desired runs and initiate the evaluation comparison process within a List or Dashboard view."
    - content: Contrast view.
