  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:

  - content: "Which property of a service, system or product does SRE primarily focus on?"
    choices:
    - content: "Security"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Security is definitely important in SRE, but reliability is the primary focus of this engineering discipline."
    - content: "Cost to run"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Expenses and resource usage are definitely important in SRE, but reliability is the primary focus of this engineering discipline."
    - content: "Reliability"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "SRE's primary focus is indeed on reliability."
    - content: "Maintainability"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The creation of maintainable services, systems or products is definitely important in SRE, but reliability is the primary focus of this engineering discipline."

  - content: "For almost all services, systems and products, what level of reliability does an SRE strive for?"
    choices:
    - content: "100% is the goal."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "For most contexts, it isn't possible to hit 100% reliable. Even if it was, it would be cost and resource prohibitive (an as waste of both)."
    - content: "It should be as reliable as possible."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "It's important to find the appropriate level of reliability for a goal since efforts and resources beyond that are a waste. Plus *as possible* is too vague to be useful."
    - content: "A specific level identified as appropriate by the key stakeholders."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Setting a goal for a service is a collaborative effort between SRE, development resources and the business decision makers."
