  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:

  - content: "Which of these things is *not* a characteristic of toil (in the SRE context)?"
    choices:
    - content: "The work is repetitive."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Toil is repetitive in nature."
    - content: "The work is tracked in a ticket system."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "How the work is tracked isn't a characteristic of toil. While toil is often tracked this way, ticket systems could be used to track other, more productive kinds of work."
    - content: "The work provides no lasting value."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Work that is toil has no enduring value."
    - content: "The work is largely manual in nature and not automated."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Toil is almost always manual work that could be automated."

  - content: "What's an SRE's relationship to toil?"
    choices:
    - content: "SRE's work to eliminate toil as their first priority."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "SRE's work to eliminate toil whenever it's possible, but sometimes other work has greater priority."
    - content: "SRE's attempt to manage toil as best they can."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "SREs prefer to eliminate toil if possible. Well-managed toil is still toil."
    - content: "SRE's work to eliminate toil wherever and whenever it's appropriate."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. SRE's work to eliminate toil wherever and whenever it's appropriate."

  - content: "What is a suggested breakdown of work for an SRE?"
    choices:
    - content: "80% reactive ops work/20% project work."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "An SRE needs uninterrupted time to work on improving the reliability of a system, not just tending to its current needs."
    - content: "10% reactive ops work/90% project work."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Sometimes we don't get a choice how much operational load a system requires. While it may be the case that some systems have a 10% operational load, it's probably not a good expectation to have."
    - content: "50% reactive ops work/50% project work."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "This balance is what SREs usually strive for (50% is seen as an upper bound on operational load--smaller would be better)."
