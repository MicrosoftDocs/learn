  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:

  - content: "What does SLI stand for (in an SRE context)?"
    choices:
    - content: "Standard Level Indicator"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "SLI stands for Service Level Indicator."
    - content: "Service Level Indicator"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. SLI stands for Service Level Indicator."
    - content: "Safe Load Indicator"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "SLO stands for Service Level Indicator."
    - content: "System Level Interface"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "SLO stands for Service Level Indicator."

  - content: "What does SLO stand for (in an SRE context)?"
    choices:
    - content: "Service Level Outcome"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "SLO stands for Service Level Objective."
    - content: "Standard Line Operations"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "SLO stands for Service Level Objective."
    - content: "Service Load Objective"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "SLO stands for Service Level Objective."
    - content: "Service Level Objective"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. SLO stands for Service Level Objective."

  - content: "If you exhaust your error budget for a service, what should you do?"
    choices:
    - content: "Immediately restart the service involved so it can be brought back into compliance."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "An error budget is a way of tracking the aggregate reliability of a service over time as it relates to your objectives. It's important to accompany this budget with a shared understanding of how the organization should react if the amount of acceptable unreliability is exceeded. There are many possible responses, you need to choose and stick to the ones that work best in your particular context. There's no one right reaction for everyone and every situation."
    - content: "Put a hold on further releases of that software until the service has returned to the agreed upon level of reliability."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "An error budget is a way of tracking the aggregate reliability of a service over time as it relates to your objectives. It's important to accompany this budget with a shared understanding of how the organization should react if the amount of acceptable unreliability is exceeded. There are many possible responses, you need to choose and stick to the ones that work best in your particular context. There's no one right reaction for everyone and every situation."
    - content: "Immediately redirect engineering resources associated with this service from feature development to fixing the reliability problem."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "An error budget is a way of tracking the aggregate reliability of a service over time as it relates to your objectives. It's important to accompany this budget with a shared understanding of how the organization should react if the amount of acceptable unreliability is exceeded. There are many possible responses, you need to choose and stick to the ones that work best in your particular context. There's no one right reaction for everyone and every situation."
    - content: "React in a way specific to the service or organization that was previously agreed upon when creating that error budget."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "When setting up an error budget for a service, it's important to decide (and document) how the organization plans to respond if the budget is exhausted. There are many possible responses, you need to choose and stick to the ones that work best in your particular context. An error budget is a way of tracking the aggregate reliability of a service over time. It's important to accompany this budget with a shared understanding of how the organization should react if the amount of acceptable unreliability is exceeded. There are many possible responses, you need to choose and stick to the ones that work best in your particular context. There's no one right reaction for every one and every situation."

  - content: "If you exceed your error budget for a service, what should you do?"
    choices:
    - content: "Speed up the release cadence for that service."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This answer is close to being right, but it leaves out a crucial component. If the reliability of the service would still be at the desired level, even if you were to do something that could potentially decrease it. It would be reasonable to *use up* that headroom by increasing the release cadence. But that is just one possible response. The right thing to do depends on your specific circumstances."
    - content: "Focus more on feature development for that service and deploy those features faster."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This answer is close to being right, but it leaves out a crucial component. If the reliability of the service would still be at the desired level, even if you were to do something that could potentially decrease it. It would be reasonable to *use up* that headroom by increasing the feature velocity. But that is just one possible response. The right thing to do depends on your specific circumstances."
    - content: "It depends."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "There are many ways to *spend* an excess error budget. Increasing the release cadency or feature velocity, deploying more beta features, conducting more disruptive testing, and so on. It's also fine (though it brings its own set of problems) to do nothing and just operate at a greater level of reliability. All of these responses are situation specific and should be decided in your specific context."

  - content: "When a downtime or other incident occurs, should you immediately terminate the people involved?"
    choices:
    - content: "Yes, the person or people who made the mistake should always take responsibility for their actions and pay the consequences."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "It isn't possible to fire your way to reliable. If the culture focuses on blame in these situations, the organization loses the ability to learn from incident and improve upon the processes and technology that allowed it to happen in the first place. Without this feedback loop, the organization is always reacting to incidents instead of eliminating them."
    - content: "No, except under certain rare and extraordinary circumstances."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Feedback loops like blameless postmortems are crucial to continuous improvement. An organization can learn from an incident instead of firing the people involved who may understand best what happened. Instead, the organization can use this opportunity to work directly on the reliability of its services, systems and products."
