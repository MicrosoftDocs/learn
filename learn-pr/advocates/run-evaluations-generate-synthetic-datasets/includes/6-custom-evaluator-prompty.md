Custom evaluators are essential for assessing generative AI applications as they allow for a more detailed evaluation tailored to specific, context-based requirements that conventional metrics might miss. You can create a custom evaluator with Prompty, a prompt template experience within promptflow. Prompty standardizes prompts and their execution into a single asset and is composed of the specification, tooling, and runtime.
