In this workshop, you learned how to use the Azure AI Evaluation SDK to run evaluations for different scenarios and how to generate a synthetic dataset. You’re now ready to configure and run your own evaluations for your generative AI apps!

As you continue in your journey in developing AI responsibly, remember to keep responsible AI principles at the forefront of your approach to integrating AI. The generative AI development lifecycle is an iterative process where the measurement phase is critical to iterative development and getting apps into production. You’re encouraged to explore other evaluation scenarios and evolve your own approach to measuring the performance and safety of your AI systems.
