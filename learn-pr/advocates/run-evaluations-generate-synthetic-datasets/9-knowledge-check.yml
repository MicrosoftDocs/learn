  questions:
  - content: Which function enables you to send queries to an application to collect answers then run your evaluators on the resulting query and response?
    choices:
    - content: ContentSafetyEvaluator.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect: The ContentSafetyEvaluator contains a subset of the risk and safety evaluators."
    - content: model_config.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect: The model_config contains the configuration for your model and is often used to create an instance of an evaluator."
    - content: evaluate.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct: The evaluate function evaluates target or data with built-in or custom evaluators. If both target and data are provided, data is run-through target function and then results are evaluated."
    - content: Simulator.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect: Simulator is a class for generating synthetic conversations."
  - content: Which composite evaluator in the Azure AI Evaluation SDK combines the ViolenceEvaluator, SelfHarmEvaluator, HateUnfairnessEvaluator, and SexualEvaluator?
    choices:
    - content: ContentSafetyEvaluator.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: 'Correct: The Content Safety Evaluator combines a subset of the safety evaluators for a single output of combined metrics for a query and response pair.'
    - content: QAEvaluator.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect: The QAEvaluator combines a subset of the quality evaluators for a single output of combined metrics for a query and response pair."

      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect: The RiskEvaluator isn't an evaluator supported within the Azure AI Evaluation SDK."
    - content: ContentHarmEvaluator.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect: The ContentHarmEvaluator isn't an evaluator supported within the Azure AI Evaluation SDK."
  - content: To track evaluation results in your Azure AI project,  which parameter must be included in the evaluate function?
    choices:
    - content: result.studio_url.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect: The result.studio_url property can be used for a link to view your logged evaluation results in Azure AI Foundry."
    - content: evaluator_config.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect: evaluator_config contains the evaluator names as keys and values that are dictionaries containing the column mappings."
    - content: target.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect: The target is the target to be evaluated."
    - content: azure_ai_project.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct: The azure_ai_project must be passed into the evaluate function to track the evaluation results in an Azure AI Project. The Azure AI Project configuration consists of the Azure project name, resource group, subscription ID, Azure OpenAI API key, and API version."
