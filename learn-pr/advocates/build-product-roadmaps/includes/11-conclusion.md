At the start of the module, you (as Fabrikam's Product Manager) were trying to understand what features we needed to build next to make our AI-based fashion app a success. We needed to know what to build, how to communicate that to the product engineering team building the app, and how to manage the product process.

To help achieve this goal, we implemented a product roadmap. Our roadmap provides a focal point for the product engineering team to ensure they know not only what we're building but why. It centers on the problem we're trying to solve as a company, and how we intend to solve it. Without it, we don't have a mechanism to manage our product process, nor do we have any means of ensuring we build the product we need and our customers want.

With our product roadmap in place, we can manage both the day-to-day product process and have the data we need to keep our executive team, investors, and customers informed about our progress. Using prioritization, we know what the most important features are that we should build next. Using our estimates, we can understand how long that might take.

Fabrikam is now set up for product success, and hopefully their fashion app is a market success!
