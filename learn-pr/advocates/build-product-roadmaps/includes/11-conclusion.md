At the start of the module, you as Fabrikam's Product Manager, were trying to understand what features we needed to build next to make our AI-based fashion app a success. We needed to know what to build and how to communicate that to the product engineering team building the app and manage the product process.

To help achieve this goal, we implemented a product road map. The road map allows us to see the path forward for the app. Our road map provides a focal point for the product engineering team to ensure they know not only what we're building but why, the problem we're trying to solve as a company, and how we intend to solve it. Without it, we don't have a mechanism to manage our product process and no means of ensuring we build the product we need and our customers want.

With our product road map in place, we can manage both the day-to-day product process and have the data we need to keep our executive team, investors, and customers informed about our progress. Using prioritization we know what the most important features that we should build next are and using our estimates we can understand how long that might take.

Fabrikam is now set up for product success and hopefully their fashion app will be a market success!
