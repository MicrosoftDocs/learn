As you build your product roadmap, you also need to know who you're building your roadmap for. Every audience of a roadmap has different expectations. Because your roadmap canâ€™t be all things to all people, you need to consider different formats or documents for these different audiences.

At Fabrikam, the audiences for our product roadmap are:

## Your product engineering team

The engineers, designers, and product managers that are working on the product. They're looking for lower-level tactical information at the sprint and story level that tells them what to work on right now:

* What do we plan to do this sprint?
* The status of the work they're doing right now.

This audience is the primary and default audience for your product roadmap, and this module is designed to produce an artifact that is most suited to help that audience.

## Your executive team and investors

Your executive team is interested in your high-level goals, like the total time and cost of development work and how it achieves the company's strategic objectives. Most likely, the executive audience is interested in the reporting outputs from your product management process.

* What you plan to do in the short term; for example, the next quarter? What are you going to do next?
* What you have and are achieving currently; for example, this quarter? Are you on schedule?
* The ongoing and planned time and cost of your development.

Most product managers take the outputs of past and current work done by the product engineering team and develop a presentation for their executive team.

The same or a similar presentation is also useful for investors. They're interested in how the product is growing and improving and what you're planning next, so they can understand how you're spending their money.

## Customers

Your customers (and your Sales and Marketing team) want to see what features you're adding that gives the product more capabilities or makes it easier to use. This presentation is usually a distillation of the presentation a product manager provides to an executive team, minus the effort required to develop it and stated in marketing terms.
