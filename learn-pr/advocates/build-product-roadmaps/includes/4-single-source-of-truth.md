As we discovered so far, you share your product roadmap with a wide diversity of potential audiences. You also need to keep track of many details on what you're building and how it's progressing. These requirements mean you should really have a single source of truth for your roadmap. If suddenly you have data in multiple places, then you need to update all the audience-centric plans when something changes.

This problem is where an off-the-shelf roadmap tool starts to come in handy. These tools allow you to create the various roadmap components as artifacts. They allow you to track to what you're building, what you plan to build, and the state of your roadmap.

There's a wide selection of potential tools available to you. These tools range from add-ons or extensions to common ticketing frameworks like [Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira), Getting Things Done (GTD) planning tools like [Trello](https://trello.com/) and [Asana](https://asana.com/), or product-centric roadmap tools like [Shortcut](https://www.shortcut.com/). These tools allow you to have a single source of truth and output the data in different forms suitable for varying audiences.

You can do similar tracking with documents or a spreadsheet. However, neither of these tools is designed for this purpose and both lack tracking and reporting capabilities. They're not the optimal tools for managing a roadmap. These tools are, however, cheap or free.

If you donâ€™t already have a tool, we recommend you try a few to find one that suits your team. Here are some useful selection factors to consider:

- Does the tool let you plan at all the levels of granularity: milestones, epic, story?
- Does the tool have a means of prioritizing work?
- Does the tool integrate with other products in your tool chain; for example, with version control, CI/CD, and your collaboration and support tools?
- Does the tool have reporting and analytics capabilities?
- Do you expect the tool to still work for your team in 6, 12, or 18 months?

You can use these criteria to evaluate the available solutions to find one that works for your organization.
