Now that we have some background about product roadmaps, let's look at the components that make up a roadmap. The product roadmap is the strategic guide to building your product. The mission of your product, the answer to the "Why are you building the product?" question should drive every roadmap.

If you can’t answer this question, you need to rethink building a roadmap or developing the product in the first place!

This mission is often articulated as your "elevator pitch"; a pitch given in the two or three minutes it takes you to ride an elevator. The Fabrikam team's mission is:

> Hi, I'm Jane Smith, the CEO of Fabrikam. Last year, I went to a friend's wedding, and I was really taken with one of my fellow guests' outfit. I forgot to ask her where she got the outfit at the wedding, but when I got home, I realized I had a photo of the outfit. I tried to use the picture to find the outfit, but found the experience frustrating and ultimately unsuccessful. That inspired me to build Fabrikam, an app which uses machine learning and AI to identify fashion brands from photographs and makes it easier for you to find and buy the clothes you love.

The product's mission is usually an extension of your elevator pitch with a clearer articulation of the problem you're trying to solve and how you're going to solve it.

## What's the problem

State the high-level problem you're trying to solve. Addressing this problem should be at the heart of your product. At Fabrikam, we know the identifying a clothing item and its brand from an image is hard and time-consuming. Even if you can, it's often difficult to track the item down to a store to buy it.

## What's the solution

Once you articulate the problem, you need to understand the high-level solution you're building to solve the problem. In our case, we're building an app that uses machine learning and AI to identify the clothes you want easier, and then allows you to buy those clothes without leaving the app.

## Everyone owns the mission

Everyone in your Product, Design, and Engineering teams should be able to give the product’s "elevator pitch." They should understand and absorb the "why" of the product; the problem you're tying to solve and how you propose to solve it.

This "elevator pitch" mission provides those teams with a reference point to validate that the work they're doing is the right work and that it's adding value to the product. Both are key drivers for engineer happiness. If you can’t connect your work to the mission, or to engineering tooling that accelerates your development in some way. It’s probably a good indication that you shouldn't be doing the work.
