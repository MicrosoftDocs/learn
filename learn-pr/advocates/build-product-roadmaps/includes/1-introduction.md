You have an amazing idea. You’ve taken the core concepts of your idea and turned them into a prototype, a Minimum Viable Product (MVP). The prototype is the first pass. It’s not pretty or complete, and often not tested. Frank Robinson said when he coined the MVP term:

> ... think big for the long term but small for the short term. Think big enough that the first product is a sound launching pad for it and its next generation and the roadmap that follows, but not so small that you leave room for a competitor to get the jump on you.

Once you have your prototype, how then do you turn it into a fully fledged product? Enter the product roadmap.

This module is an introduction, for Product Managers and Product Engineers, to developing product roadmaps. We present a high-level structure for roadmaps and a process for how to build them. We'll introduce you to a startup, Fabrikam, who is building a new AI-powered fashion app. We'll take you through their process for building their first product roadmap. This module assumes you're using and understand Agile methodology, but we're not opinionated about what kind of Agile you embrace. This module isn't a definitive guide to product roadmaps, but a starting point from which to experiment and learn what works for you.

You’ll learn how to:

* Describe the basic components and importance of product roadmaps.
* Identify your product mission and the appropriate audience(s) for your roadmap
* Structure a roadmap and choose a prioritization methodology appropriate for your product.

By the end of this module, you'll be able to construct a product roadmap that your team can use to build and manage your product.
