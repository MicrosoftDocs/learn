A milestone is the time period you use to complete some work. It might be a month, three months, or another period. We generally represent milestones as time, either explicitly by adding a target date or using a time-based interval like months or weeks. Sometimes, though, a milestone might be an objective instead, like version 1 of a product.

Each milestone has themes associated with it. A milestone also allows you to report what you’re going to achieve to address that milestone and helps you measure progress towards that goal. Your reports on this component are likely to be what your leadership team or customer is most interested in. So, you need to be realistic about what you can achieve in a milestone.

At Fabrikam, we use a quarterly (every three months) milestone, so our current milestone is Quarter 1 of this year:

> During Q1, we plan to focus on three themes: "Acquire more customers," "Reduce customer churn," and "Increase checkouts."

When estimating what you can complete in a milestone, you need to work out how long it should take to complete the work you planned. We talk more about estimates in the unit on user stories later in this module. You should also know the resources available to you, and hence be able to solve for what’s possible in a milestone using this data. Again, having a tool that handles milestones and estimates automatically is useful.

Startups tend to be fast-moving. Priorities, resourcing, and requirements change quickly, so most people don’t plan milestones beyond short and medium periods; for example, one to six months. Anything beyond that starts to become more like guesswork than planning. We suggest planning three milestones—say, month one, month two, and month three—so you know what you’re doing now and broadly what you plan to do in the following months.
