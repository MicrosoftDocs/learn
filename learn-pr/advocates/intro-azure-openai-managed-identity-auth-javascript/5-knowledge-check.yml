  questions:
    - content: "What is the primary benefit of using managed identities over API keys in Azure OpenAI?"
      choices:
      - content: "Enhanced security"
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "Managed identities eliminate the need to store credentials within application code, reducing the risk of credential leaks. They leverage Entra ID for authentication, providing a more secure and automated method for accessing Azure services."
      - content: "Increased performance"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "While managed identities improve security, they don't inherently increase application performance."
      - content: "Cost reduction"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Managed identities don't directly impact the cost of Azure services; their primary benefit is enhanced security."
    - content: "Which role in Azure OpenAI allows you to create custom fine-tuned models and manage model deployments?"
      choices:
      - content: "Cognitive Services OpenAI Contributor"
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "This role includes permissions to create custom fine-tuned models, upload datasets, and manage model deployments."
      - content: "Cognitive Services OpenAI User"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "The OpenAI User role has limited permissions and can't create or manage models. It only allows viewing resources and making inference API calls."
      - content: "Cognitive Services Usages Reader"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "The Usages Reader role is focused on monitoring usage and doesn't have permissions for model management. It only allows viewing quota usage."
    - content: "In the provided JavaScript code example, what is the purpose of the openai.ChatCompletion.create method?"
      choices:
      - content: "Generate a response from the OpenAI model"
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "This method sends a request to the OpenAI service with the specified parameters, such as the model, prompt, and other settings, and returns the generated response."
      - content: "Authenticate the user"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Authentication is handled separately, typically using credentials or tokens, and isn't the purpose of this method."
      - content: "Store the API response"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "This method generates a response from the OpenAI model but doesn't handle storing the response; storing data would require additional code."
