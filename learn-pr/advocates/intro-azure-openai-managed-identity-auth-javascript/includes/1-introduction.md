Good security practices require that you control access to applications that you develop. Developing an application in Azure OpenAI Service is no different. In this module, you learn about configuring authentication to Azure OpenAI by using JavaScript, the available roles in Azure OpenAI, and the benefits of using managed identities over API keys.

By the end of this module, you are able to:

- Describe the role-based access control (RBAC) roles for use in Azure OpenAI and configure role assignments.
- Describe the differences between using API keys and managed identities within Azure OpenAI.
- Configure keyless authentication to Azure OpenAI for local development for JavaScript.
- Configure keyless authentication to Azure OpenAI for Azure-hosted environments for JavaScript.
