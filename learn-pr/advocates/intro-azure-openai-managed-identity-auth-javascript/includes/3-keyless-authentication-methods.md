In keyless authentication to Azure OpenAI for JavaScript, you use Azure's managed identities or service principals to authenticate instead of hardcoding API keys or other credentials. This is done through the `DefaultAzureCredential` or `ManagedIdentityCredential` class, which provides a secure and streamlined way to obtain tokens needed for authenticating Azure services. Here's how it works in practice:

1. Set Up Azure Environment: Ensure your Azure environment is configured correctly with managed identities.
2. Initialize Credentials: Use the `DefaultAzureCredential` class or `ManagedIdentityCredential` class from the Azure Identity SDK for JavaScript to handle the authentication process seamlessly.

Here's an example code snippet:

```javascript
import { AzureOpenAI } from 'openai';
import { getBearerTokenProvider, DefaultAzureCredential } from '@azure/identity';

// Make sure to set AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT with the endpoint of your Azure resource.

const credential = new DefaultAzureCredential();
const scope = 'https://cognitiveservices.azure.com/.default';
const azureADTokenProvider = getBearerTokenProvider(credential, scope);

// Create client instance
// 3) Create an Azure OpenAI client
const openai = new AzureOpenAI({ azureADTokenProvider });

// 4) Make API call and print response
const result = await openai.chat.completions.create({
  model: 'gpt-4-1106-preview',
  messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'Say hello!' }],
});

console.log(result.choices[0]!.message?.content);
```

3. Create Client Instance: Instantiate your `AzureOpenAI` with the endpoint and the credentials obtained from the `DefaultAzureCredential`.
4. Make API Calls: Use the client to interact with Azure OpenAI services securely, without explicitly handling sensitive credentials.
