Working on an application means you will write code to implement business requirements. For the sake of speed and reliability, you and your team might not write all of that code yourselves. You might rely on external code, libraries that someone else wrote.

One way to approach building your app with external libraries, is to use an existing ecosystem of libraries that you can both download from and possibly in the future even add to. By using these libraries, you will be able to finish building your app faster and be able to take it to market faster than the competition. Another benefit to using libraries could be that your app is following best practices on authentication and authorization. After all, protecting your and your customers' data is a significant concern.

In this module, you will use the NPM command-line tool and the NPM global registry to add libraries to your application code. You will also be introduced to how to manage updates and mitigate issues.
