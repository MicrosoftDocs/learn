You've learnt some practical steps for estimating, tracking, and allocating AI costs, including how to estimate token usage, apply tools like the Azure Pricing Calculator, and apply billing filters to gain visibility into your AI spend. For ongoing cost management, we've covered how to configure alerts for budget thresholds or usage anomalies, and how to use Azure API Management Gateway for granular token tracking. 

By applying these practices, you can ensure that your AI investments remain transparent, well-managed, and aligned with your organization's broader financial objectives.
