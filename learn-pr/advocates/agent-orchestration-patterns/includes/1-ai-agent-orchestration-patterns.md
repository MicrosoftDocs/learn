Multi-agent architectures allow complex problems to be broken down into specialized units of work or knowledge. Each task can then be allocated to dedicated AI agents with optimized capabilities. Multi-agent architectures bring the following benefits:

- Specialization: Individual agents can focus on a specific domain or capability, which reduces code and prompt complexity.
- Scalability: Agents can be added or modified without redesigning the entire system.
- Maintainability: Testing and debugging can be focused on individual agents, which reduces the complexity of these tasks.
- Optimization: Each agent can use distinct models, task-solving approaches, knowledge, tools, and compute to achieve its outcomes.

The challenge with this approach is ensuring that the disparate agents are able to work with each other and that the complexity of this approach doesn't lead to inefficiencies or unpredictable outcomes. In this module, we explore the following orchestration patterns:

- Sequential orchestration
- Concurrent orchestration
- Group chat orchestration
- Handoff orchestration
- Magentic orchestration
