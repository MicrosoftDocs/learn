  questions:
    - content: "What is the primary role of a generative AI Center of Excellence (CoE)?"
      choices:
        - content: "To manage the financial aspects of AI projects."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "While the CoE does promote financial efficiency through FinOps principles, its primary role isn't to manage the financial aspects of AI projects."
        - content: "To provide strategic guidance, frameworks, and best practices for GenAIOps."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "The CoE's primary role is to provide strategic guidance, frameworks, and best practices for GenAIOps processes."
        - content: "To develop AI models from scratch."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "The CoE doesn't focus on developing AI models from scratch; it provides support and guidance for managing AI workloads."
    - content: "Which of the following is a key element of GenAIOps processes?"
      choices:
        - content: "Manual deployment of AI workloads."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "GenAIOps processes emphasize automated deployment mechanisms, not manual deployment."
        - content: "Integration of security and compliance technologies."
          isCorrect: true
