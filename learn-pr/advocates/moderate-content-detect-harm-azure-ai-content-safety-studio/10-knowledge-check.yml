  title: Knowledge check
  questions:
  - content: What is the purpose of the Precision metric?
    choices:
    - content: To measure the total volume of harmful content that the model identifies.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: The Precision metric doesn't measure the total volume of harmful content.
    - content: To measure how much of the content that the model identifies as harmful is actually harmful.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: The Precision metric in Content Safety evaluates the accuracy of the model by measuring how much of the content that the model identifies as harmful is indeed harmful.
    - content: To measure the model's ability to identify actual harmful content.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: The Precision metric doesn't directly measure the model's ability to identify actual harmful content.
    - content: To measure the speed at which the model detects harmful content.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: The Precision metric doesn't measure the speed of detection.
  - content: Which feature of Azure AI Content Safety is responsible for detecting and blocking incorrect information in model outputs?
    choices:
    - content: Text moderation
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Text moderation detects harmful content in text.
    - content: Prompt shields
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: To detect user prompt attacks and document attacks, prompt shields analyze large language model (LLM) inputs.
    - content: Image moderation
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Image moderation analyzes images to identify and block offensive content.
    - content: Groundedness detection
      isCorrect: true
      explanation:  The groundedness detection feature detects and blocks incorrect information in model outputs, to help ensure that the text responses are factual and accurate based on the provided source materials.
  - content: What is the purpose of the F1 score metric?
    choices:
    - content: To measure the total volume of harmful content that the model identifies.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: The F1 score metric doesn't measure the total volume of harmful content.
    - content: To measure the balance between **Precision** and **Recall**.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: The F1 score metric in Content Safety is used when there's a need to balance Precision (the accuracy of identified harmful content) and Recall (the model's ability to identify actual harmful content).
    - content: To measure the speed at which the model detects harmful content.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: The F1 score metric doesn't measure the speed of detection.
    - content: To measure the model's ability to identify actual harmful content.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation:  The F1 score metric doesn't directly measure the model's ability to identify actual harmful content.
