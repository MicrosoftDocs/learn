quiz:
  questions:
    - content: "What steps can you take to improve the data security of an AI enabled application?"
      choices:
        - content: "AI systems should only be able to enact existing data security controls and use the access permissions of the user they are acting on behalf of."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Access control decisions should never be devolved to an AI system."
        - content: "Keep your AI enabled application isolated from the rest of your IT environment."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Isolating an AI enabled application will limit usability rather than improve data security."
        - content: "Run your AI enabled application on premises rather than in the cloud."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Running an AI enabled application on premises requires you to create your own AI platform which is expensive and requires a large amount of compute, which is not feasible for most organisations. It will also not improve data security."
    - content: "What kind AI harms and attacks does a metaprompt help to mitigate?"
      choices:
        - content: "Model poisoning"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Metaprompts cannot help mitigate model poisoning attacks."
        - content: "AI overreliance"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Metaprompts cannot help mitigate overreliance on AI."
        - content: "Jailbreaks"
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "A metaprompt is a set of natural language instructions that tell an AI system how to behave or not behave."
    - content: "You want to restrict your AI application from returning content of a sexual or hateful nature, what would you implement to accomplish this goal?"
      choices:
        - content: "Metaprompts"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Metaprompts cannot be configured to filter unwanted content."
        - content: "Content safety filters"
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Content safety filters can be configured to prevent an application from returning content of a sexual or hateful nature."
        - content: "Application security best practices"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Application security best practices cannot prevent an AI application from returning content of a sexual or hateful nature."
