          explanation: "Isolating an AI enabled application limits usability rather than improve data security."
        - content: "Run your AI enabled application on premises rather than in the cloud."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Running an AI enabled application on premises requires you to create your own AI platform. This is not feasible for most organizations. It will also not improve data security."

      choices:
        - content: "Model poisoning"

          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Content safety filters can be configured to prevent an application from returning content of a sexual or hateful nature."
        - content: "Application security best practices"
