  questions:
    - content: "How can GitHub Copilot assist in optimizing SQL queries within a GitHub Codespace environment?"
      choices:
        - content: "By providing general coding tips and tricks."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "General coding tips don't address SQL query optimization."
        - content: "By suggesting specific optimizations for slow or inefficient queries."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "GitHub Copilot can analyze SQL queries and suggest optimizations such as removing unnecessary JOINs, optimizing SELECT DISTINCT, or refactoring subqueries."
        - content: "By automatically rewriting all SQL queries without user input."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "GitHub Copilot requires user input to provide specific suggestions and doesn't automatically rewrite all queries."
    - content: "What is the role of GitHub Copilot in generating SQL-based tests or assertions?"
      choices:
        - content: "It can suggest appropriate testing frameworks based on the project type."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "GitHub Copilot can help generate SQL-based tests or assertions to verify query results or database state and suggest appropriate testing frameworks based on the project type."
        - content: "It can execute SQL tests automatically without user intervention."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "GitHub Copilot assists in generating tests but doesn't execute them automatically."
        - content: "It can only generate unit tests for non-SQL code."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "GitHub Copilot can generate tests for SQL code as well as other types of code."
    - content: "How can GitHub Copilot enhance the understanding of complex SQL queries?"
      choices:
        - content: "By providing detailed documentation for the entire codebase."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "While GitHub Copilot can generate documentation, the specific enhancement for understanding SQL queries comes from its ability to explain to them."
        - content: "By explaining the logic and structure of complex SQL queries."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "GitHub Copilot can explain complex SQL queries to help users understand their logic and structure."
        - content: "By rewriting SQL queries to make them simpler."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Rewriting queries is related to optimization and refactoring, but doesn't increase understanding of query functionality."
