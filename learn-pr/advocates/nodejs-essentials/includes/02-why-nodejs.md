Node.js has become one of the most used technologies by many giant companies and startups ( [Netflix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p74282nDMX8&feature=emb_title), [Trello](https://tech.trello.com/the-trello-tech-stack/), [Walmart](https://medium.com/walmartlabs/migrating-large-enterprise-to-nodejs-6c38523d2b33), [Uber](https://eng.uber.com/uber-tech-stack-part-two/), [Ebay](https://tech.ebayinc.com/engineering/how-we-built-ebays-first-node-js-application/), and [NASA](https://openjsf.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/84/2020/02/Case_Study-Node.js-NASA.pdf)).

Node.js is a single-threaded non-blocking runtime; it's based on the event-driven I/O paradigm and is capable of executing JavaScript outside the browser. The Non-blocking aspect means that, for instance, when a remote client makes a request, a server written in JavaScript and running on Node.js would handle that request and would construct and send back a response; then move on the next request, without blocking and waiting for other tasks to finish.

Some of the advantages of using Node.js are:

### JavaScript

_"Any application that can be written in JavaScript, will eventually be written in JavaScript."_ – Jeff Atwood, Author, Entrepreneur, Cofounder of StackOverflow.

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime, it can run and execute your JavaScript applications and code on the server in particular, and outside the browser in general.

Nowadays, many applications, outside the browser, are written in JavaScript or support JavaScript as a first class-citizen language:

- Code editors such as [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and [Atom](https://atom.io/) are written in JavaScript or TypeScrpit (a superset of JavaScript with static typings). They run an embedded version of the Node.js runtime.
- Many IoT (Internet Of Things) and real-time applications are written in JavaScript and rely Node.js to run, either on the server or on microcontrollers and SoC (System on a Chip) platforms such as the [Puck-js](https://www.puck-js.com/) or the [Tessel](https://tessel.io/).
- Technologies such as [NativeScript](https://www.nativescript.org/) allow us to use JavaScript (or TypeScript) to build performant native mobile applications.
- Many applications use JavaScript for their plugin-system, for example [Sketch](https://developer.sketch.com/plugins/), [Adobe XD](https://adobexdplatform.com/plugin-docs/tutorials/quick-start/), and [Google App Script](https://developers.google.com/apps-script).

### Community

The community has already built over a million modules and libraries for Node.js, and published on [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/), a Node.js Package Manager. Developers can easily download and integrate those modules into their existing projects. The number of applications that can run on Node.js are endless: from command-line tools (that is, the [Hexa CLI](https://hexa.run)), to frameworks (that is, [Nest.js](https://nestjs.com/)), web servers (that is, [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/)), and more.

### Open Source

Node.js is open source and supported by the [The OpenJS Foundation](https://openjsf.org/). It has a massive active open-source community and contributors working hard to improve and optimize the technology. There is even a Community top-level committee who has authority over outward-facing community outreach efforts ([learn mode](https://nodejs.org/en/about/community/)).
