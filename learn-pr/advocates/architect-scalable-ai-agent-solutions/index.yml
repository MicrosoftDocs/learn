abstract: |
  In this module, you learn how to design AI agent architectures that scale with business demand, provide deep visibility into cost drivers, and support long-term governance. You explore reference architectures, best practices, multi-agent design options, and financial design principles that ensure operational efficiency, cost control, and strategic alignment.
  By the end of this module, you're able to:
    - Leverage reference architectures and orchestration patterns for scalable AI agent solutions.
    - Describe cost-effectiveness strategies for multi-agent systems.
    - Apply design principles and strategies for cost-efficient AI agent deployments.
    - Align AI agent architecture with business strategy and financial goals.
prerequisites: |
  - Basic understanding of AI and large language models (LLMs)
  - Familiarity with cloud platforms and software lifecycle concepts
