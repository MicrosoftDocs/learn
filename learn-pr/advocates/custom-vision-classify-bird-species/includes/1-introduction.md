As an ornithologist, you study the behavior, physiology, and conservation of birds and bird habitat. Your work often involves surveying, recording, and reporting on bird activity. To help gather data, you want to build a machine learning model that identifies photos of birds by species. You also want to better document endangered birds species, to help populations increase. In addition, learning more about birds is a great way to educate yourself and others about the natural phenomena in your local area.

In this Microsoft Learn module, you'll use Azure Cognitive Services Custom Vision to create a machine learning model that can identify species of birds. We'll use the NABirds dataset from the Cornell Lab of Ornithology (CLO) to train a model to recognize photos of bird species. You can use the model to help you document trends and patterns of bird habits.

The data is provided by the CLO, with a special thanks to photographers, contributors, and visitors to [All About Birds](https://www.allaboutbirds.org/news/?azure-portal=true). This material is based on work that is supported by the National Science Foundation under grant #1010818. This module includes a subset of the full dataset. You can [download the full dataset](https://dl.allaboutbirds.org/nabirds?azure-portal=true). For specific details about the dataset, you can [download a PDF file](https://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2015/papers/Horn_Building_a_Bird_2015_CVPR_paper.pdf?azure-portal=true) from the Computer Vision Foundation.
