Now that you've completed this module, you have a comprehensive understanding of how to help secure applications developed in Azure OpenAI Service by using Python. You learned how to configure authentication, explored the RBAC roles available in Azure OpenAI, and learned about the benefits of using managed identities over API keys.

You can now configure role assignments and set up keyless authentication for both local development and Azure-hosted environments by using Python. This knowledge equips you to implement robust security practices in your Azure OpenAI applications.
