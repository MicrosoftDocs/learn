The Cloud Adoption Framework (CAF) provides a structured process for adopting AI solutions in Azure. This framework outlines clear steps, many of which apply to Microsoft Copilot adoption.

The Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework (CAF) provides a structured approach to cloud transformation, and it plays a critical role in guiding successful Microsoft Copilot deployments. By aligning Copilot adoption with CAF's phases of Strategy, Plan, Ready, Govern, Secure, and Manage, organizations can ensure that AI integration supports business
goals, maintains compliance, and delivers measurable value.

The CAF AI adoption process supports organizations ranging from large enterprises to startups. You learn how to identify AI use cases, select appropriate AI solutions, and build effective AI workloads. The guidance
also covers operational processes required for governance, management, and security of AI implementations.
