abstract: |
  In this module, you explore essential best practices that empower
  your organization to drive cost-efficiency, strengthen governance, scale
  AI capabilities, and foster consistency and knowledge sharing. These
  practices are key to delivering high-quality AI agents across the
  enterprise.

  You gain insights into key frameworks such as the AI Center of
  Excellence (CoE), FinOps, GenAI Ops, the Cloud Adoption Framework (CAF),
  and the Well-Architected Framework (WAF). Each of these frameworks
  offers unique approaches to accelerate adoption, optimize resources, and
  align AI initiatives with strategic business outcomes.

  While each framework brings distinct value, organizations aren't
  expected to adopt them all. Instead, you can selectively apply the
  frameworks, or specific best practices within them, that best support
  your goals, operational context, and maturity level. This module
  provides a high-level overview of each framework to help guide informed
  decisions on which approaches are most relevant to your organization's
  needs.
  
  By the end of this module, you are able to:
    - "Understand the role of an AI Center of Excellence (CoE) in managing AI agents."
    - "Describe the FinOps Framework and its relevance to AI agents."
    - "Explain the principles of GenAI Ops and their application in managing AI agents."
    - "Understand the Cloud Adoption Framework and its role in AI agent deployment."
    - "Apply the Well-Architected Framework to ensure AI agent efficiency and reliability."
prerequisites: |
  - "Basic understanding of AI and large language models (LLMs)"
  - "Familiarity with cloud platforms and software lifecycle concepts"
