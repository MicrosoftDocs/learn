      explanation: "AI deployment should follow the establishment of a well-supported CoE team."
    - content: "Assign data scientists to manage compliance and governance independently."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Compliance and governance should be addressed by a multidisciplinary CoE team, not delegated to a single role."
  - content: "How does a FinOps framework enhance the cost-effectiveness of AI agents?"
    choices:
    - content: "By embedding financial accountability and operational transparency across the AI lifecycle."
      isCorrect: true

    choices:
    - content: "It proactively monitors and manages advanced LLM workflows with structured deployment strategies."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Level 3 organizations have moved beyond experimentation and are implementing structured, monitored workflows to approach operational excellence."
    - content: "It's just beginning to explore LLM capabilities and lacks systematic practices."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This describes Level 1 ('Initial'), not Level 3."
    - content: "It has fully optimized LLM operations and maintains a cutting-edge position by tracking the latest advancements."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This describes Level 4 ('Optimized'), which is the highest maturity level."
  - content: "What is the purpose of the AI checklists in the Cloud Adoption Framework (CAF) for AI?"
    choices:

      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Performance Efficiency emphasizes horizontal scaling, early testing, and health monitoring to ensure AI workloads meet performance goals."
    - content: "Operational Excellence"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Operational Excellence focuses on streamlining operations, monitoring, and safe deploymentâ€”not specifically on scaling and performance."
    - content: "Security"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Security addresses confidentiality, integrity, and availability, but not performance-related concerns."
