content: Choose the best response for each question. 
quiz:
  questions:
    - content: "What is one of the main challenges of securing AI systems?"
      choices:
        - content: "Nondeterministic nature of generative AI systems"
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "As AI systems are nondeterministic, this means that you don't always get the same output with the same input. Security controls often assume that the same input equals the same output every time, so this creates challenges when looking to apply security controls to AI systems."
        - content: "AI is fundamentally insecure"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "AI isn't fundamentally insecure, although securing AI systems is a rapidly developing field and new methods to secure it are being developed all the time."
        - content: "AI is too new to secure"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "While AI is a new technology and methods for securing it are developing rapidly, it isn't impossible to apply security controls to AI."
    - content: "Which kind of jailbreak attack involves sending an AI model multiple prompts to incrementally break guardrails to enact a jailbreak attack?"
      choices:
        - content: "Spoofing"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Spoofing is a type of cybersecurity attack, but not relevant to sending an AI model multiple prompts to break guardrails."
        - content: "Injection"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Injection is a type of cybersecurity attack, but not relevant to sending an AI model multiple prompts to break guardrails."
        - content: "Crescendo"
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Crescendo acts over several turns, gradually shifting the conversation to a particular end to enact a jailbreak."
    - content: "Which is the middle layer of the three AI architecture layers?"
      choices:
        - content: "AI Usage Security"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "AI Usage Security layer is the AI architecture layer that deals with how AI capabilities are ultimately used and consumed. This layer is the top of the stack and closest to human users."
        - content: "AI Platform Security"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "AI platform security layer is the AI architecture layer that deals with providing AI capabilities to applications. This is the bottom layer of the stack."
        - content: "AI Application Security"
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "AI application security is the AI architecture layer that deals with how an application accesses the AI capabilities and provides the service or interface that will be consumed by the user. This is the “middle” layer in AI architecture."
