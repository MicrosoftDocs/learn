  questions:
    - content: "Which of the following strategies is recommended for handling heavy load in an Azure application?"
      choices:
        - content: "Increasing the size of virtual machines or scaling up by adding more instances"
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Increasing the size of the virtual machines or scaling up by adding more instances helps address heavy load on an application"
        - content: "Implementing synchronous data replication across multiple regions"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Synchronous replication across regions doesn't help address application load issues"
        - content: "Deploying virtual machines in a single fault domain"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Deploying virtual machines in a single fault domain doesn't help address application load issues"
    - content: "What is the purpose of using Availability Zones in Azure?"
      choices:
        - content: "To distribute VMs across multiple regions for global load balancing"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Availability zones aren't related to load balancing"
        - content: "To protect applications and data from datacenter failures within a region"

          explanation: "Availability zones are used to protect applications and data from datacenter failures within a region"
        - content: "To replicate data synchronously across different continents"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Availability zones do not assist in replicating data across different continents"
    - content: "Which Azure service provides the ability to replicate virtual machines to another Azure region for business continuity and disaster recovery?"
      choices:
        - content: "Azure Site Recovery"
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Azure Site Recovery allows you to replicate virtual machines to another Azure region for business continuity and disaster recovery"
        - content: "Azure Traffic Manager"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Azure Traffic Manager allows you to load balance traffic, but does not assist in replicating virtual machines for business continuity and disaster recovery"
        - content: "Azure Backup"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Azure Backup allows you to back up virtual machines, but does not assist in replicating virtual machines for business continuity and disaster recovery"
