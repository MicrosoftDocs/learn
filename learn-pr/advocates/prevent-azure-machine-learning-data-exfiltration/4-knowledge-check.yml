  questions:
    - content: "You're tasked with enabling data exfiltration prevention for an Azure OpenAI service in your organization. You want to restrict outbound traffic to avoid data being sent to unauthorized locations. What do you need to configure?"
      choices:
        - content: "Disable outbound traffic and allow for in-Azure communication only."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Disabling outbound traffic will completely shut off the Azure AI service affected."
        - content: "Enable the restriction for outbound traffic and configure the list of approved FQDNs."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Disabling outbound traffic and configuring the allowed FQDNs allow the service to function properly while limiting the ability of a malicious individual to extract data."
        - content: "Configure the list of approved FQDNs so data can only be sent to those."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "The list of allowed FQDNs has no effect if the outbound traffic hasn't been disabled previously."
    - content: "How can you restrict Inbound traffic for compute instances or clusters using a public IP address in Azure Machine Learning?"
      choices:
        - content: "Restrict traffic using a network security group (NSG) and service tags."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "NSGs can block unauthorized traffic while allowing for legitimate requests to go through."
        - content: "Block port 44224 for the compute or cluster instance."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Blocking port 44224 prevents Azure Machine Learning from responding to requests and shut off the service."
        - content: "Allow only HTTPS traffic (port 443) for the compute or cluster instance."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Azure Machine Learning doesn't, by default, respond to traffic on port 443 for HTTPS requests."
    - content: "You want to add another security layer to prevent data exfiltration on an Azure Machine Learning environment. How can you control the outbound traffic to allowed storage accounts only?"
      choices:
        - content: "Use 3rd party storage accounts only."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "The usage of 3rd party storage accounts by itself doesn't prevent data exfiltration."
        - content: "Use Storage accounts on different Azure subscriptions."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Storage accounts on different Azure subscriptions still allow unchecked outbound traffic."
        - content: "Use Service endpoint policies."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Service endpoint policies let you filter outbound network traffic to specific Azure Storage accounts, limiting data exfiltration."
