  questions:

  - content: "Which of the following data sources need to be validated?"
    choices:
    - content: "Data from a third-party API"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This is just one of many sources that needs to be validated."
    - content: "Data from the URL parameter"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This is just one of many sources that needs to be validated."
    - content: "Data collected from the user via an input field"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This is just one of many sources that needs to be validated."
    - content: "All of the above"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "All these sources of data need to be validated. Never trust any data that could have been modified."

  - content: "Parameterized queries (stored procedures in SQL) are a secure way to talk to the database because:"
    choices:
    - content: "They're more organized than inline database commands, and therefore less confusing for users."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Organization of the code isn't the reason that parameterized queries are more secure than inline SQL."
    - content: "There's a clear outline of the script in the stored procedure, ensuring better visibility."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Clear outline of the script isn't the reason that parameterized queries are more secure than inline SQL."
    - content: "Parameterized queries substitute variables before running queries, meaning it avoids the opportunity for code to be submitted in place of a variable."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Parameter fields used in parameterized queries are treated as data, not code, protecting against injection vulnerabilities. For more information on how to implement parameterized queries please see the [OWASP Query Parameterization Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Query_Parameterization_Cheat_Sheet.html)."

  - content: "Which of the following data needs to be output encoded?"
    choices:
    - content: "Data saved to the database"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Although data saved to the database needs to be validated to ensure the data is good, we don't need to encode it for output."
    - content: "Data to be output to the screen"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Data sent to the screen needs to be output encoded to ensure it's never interpreted as code."
    - content: "Data sent to a third-party API"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Although data sent to a third-party API needs to be validated to ensure the data is good, we don't need to encode it for output."
    - content: "Data in the URL parameters"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Although data from URL Parameters needs to be validated before it's used in our application, we don't need to encode it for output."
