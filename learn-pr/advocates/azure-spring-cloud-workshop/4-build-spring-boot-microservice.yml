      explanation: "You don't need to add or change any code in your application."
    - content: 'Add a specific Maven dependency.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Azure Spring Apps requires no Azure-specific dependency in your application."
    - content: "Set up some specific environment variables."

    - content: 'None of the above.'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Migrate your Spring Cloud apps to Azure Spring Apps is seamless without vendor lock-in."
  - content: "By default, how can you access your microservice once it's deployed?"
    choices:
    - content: "There's a specific, secured endpoint, where the application is published."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "By default, a secured endpoint is set up. You can configure your cluster not to expose it, for increased security."
    - content: "There's a publicly available endpoint."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "It's possible to assign a public address to the microservice endpoint, but it's not enabled by default for security reasons."
    - content: "The endpoint isn't available at all on the internet, so you must use a private network to access it."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "By default, it's available on the internet, using a secure token."
