In this module, you learned that Node.js is a runtime that can run JavaScript applications and code outside of a browser. You also learned how Node.js works and why Node.js is a good choice for building and running JavaScript applications. This can range from building application servers to running real-time applications on Internet of Things (IoT) embedded devices.

## Additional resources

The following applications are built with Node.js:

- CLI tools such as [hexa.run](https://www.hexa.run/) and [Azure Functions CLI](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-core-tools)
- Back-end servers and API services such as [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) and [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/)
- Desktop apps such as [Slack](https://slack.com/) (using [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/))
- IoT libraries such as [Johnny-Five](http://johnny-five.io/), [Puck-js](https://www.puck-js.com/), and [Tessel](https://tessel.io/)
- Plug-ins for [SketchApp](https://www.sketch.com/) and [Adobe XD](https://www.adobe.com/products/xd.html)
- Code editors such as [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and [Atom](https://atom.io/)
- Native mobile development with [NativeScript](https://www.nativescript.org/)
