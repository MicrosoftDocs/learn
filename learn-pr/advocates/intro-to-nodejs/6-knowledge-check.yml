  questions:
    - content: "What is Node.js?"
      choices:
        - content: "Node.js is a Java framework."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Node.js is neither a framework not a Java runtime."
        - content: "A JavaScript framework."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Node.js is wrongly presented as a framework but it's not."
        - content: "A JavaScript runtime."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Node.js is a runtime that can execute JavaScript applications."
        - content: "A JavaScript server."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Although Node.js can be used to implement a server, it's not a server."
    - content: "How does Node.js handle concurrent tasks?"
      choices:
        - content: "Node.js cannot handle concurrent tasks."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Node.js was designed from the ground up to handle concurrent operations."
        - content: "Node.js use multiple threads for concurrent tasks."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Node.js does not use multiple threads. It"
        - content: "Node.js use a single event-loop for concurrent tasks."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Node.js use a single thread and an event loop to handle concurrent non-blocking I/O tasks."
        - content: "Node.js use multiple event-loops for concurrent tasks."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Node.js use only one single event loop."
    - content: "For which of these scenarios would a Node.js app be a good fit?"
      choices:
        - content: "If my app requires a non-blocking, event-driven server."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Node.js is perfect for implementing back-end API services and real-time applications."
        - content: "If my app needs a Java runtime."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Node.js applications are usually written in JavaScript, not Java."
        - content: "If I need to build a mobile application."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Mobile applications can be built with many languages including JavaScript. Node.js is a runtime not a language."
        - content: "If my app requires CPU intensive computations."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Node.js is great for I/O. However, it is not well optimized for CPU intensive computations."
