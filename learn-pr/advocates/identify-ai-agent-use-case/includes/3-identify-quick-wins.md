When aiming to prioritize high impact AI agent use cases, it's a good
idea to identify effective solutions that can be delivered quickly to
ensure the project success.

Use the following categories to help spot cost-effective AI agents that
help you achieve quick wins.

## Low implementation complexity

Choose use cases with fewer integration requirements and clear data
inputs. Look for tasks that don't require deep hooks into legacy systems
or cross-departmental coordination and instead choose use cases that can
be built on top of existing SaaS platforms or internal tools with
exposed APIs. Favor use cases with structured, accessible data over
unstructured or siloed data.

## High financial impact

Estimate ROI based on cost savings, efficiency gains, or revenue uplift.
Define what metrics are important to you to meet these goals and then
consider use cases based upon the results. An example might be similar
to this:

|Value lever  |Example metrics  |Example AI use cases  |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Cost Savings     | Reduced labor hours, lower error rates        | Invoice processing, contract review, helpdesk deflection        |
| Efficiency     | Faster cycle times, fewer manual steps        | Workflow automation, summarization, routing        |
| Revenue Uplift    | Increased conversion, upsell, retention        | Lead scoring, personalized outreach, dynamic pricing        |

## Short time-to-value

Focus on solutions that can be deployed and deliver results within a few
months. Look for use cases that have low implementation complexity, use
prebuilt models, and require minimal customization.

## Internal champions available

Prioritize solutions that can leverage teams or leaders who are ready to
pilot and actively support the initiative. Engaged champions accelerate
adoption, provide valuable feedback, and help drive momentum. Without
committed pilot teams, achieving short time-to-value becomes
more difficult.

## Estimate delivery timelines

Realistic timeline estimation enables effective resource planning and
stakeholder management while ensuring project success. Timeline accuracy
depends on project complexity, organizational maturity, and resource
availability. You must base timeline estimates on empirical data from
your proof of concepts and organizational capabilities.

To create realistic timeline estimates:

- Use proof of concept results to estimate implementation timelines for
  each use case.
- Account for organizational maturity and complexity factors in timeline
  planning.
- Build in buffer time for learning, iteration, and unexpected
  challenges.
