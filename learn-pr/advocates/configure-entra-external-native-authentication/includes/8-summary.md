In this module, you went through a guided project focused on integrating sign-up and sign-in functionality into Android and iOS/macOS applications using Microsoft Entra's native authentication. Microsoft Entra's native authentication allows developers to have full control over the design and user experience of authentication within mobile and desktop applications. This customization includes design elements, logo placements, and layout, which ensures a consistent branding experience while maintaining security and seamless sign-in processes for users.
