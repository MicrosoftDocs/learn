Debugging is a multistage process that usually follows these steps:

1. Identify a bug in your program.
1. Find where the bug is located in your code.
1. Analyze why the bug occurs.
1. Fix the bug.
1. Validate that your fix works.

After you identify an error in your Node.js program, the first challenge you'll face is to find where the error is located in your code. To achieve that, one of the most efficient ways is to run your code step by step to get an idea of where things start to go wrong.

## Breakpoints

Running through *all* your code step by step might be extremely inefficient if your program has thousands of lines of code. In that case, you can use a *breakpoint*. It allows you to *break* from your program's normal execution and pause at a given *point* in your code.

Using breakpoints, you can make your program run normally up until you reach the critical portion of code where you suspect the error is located. Then you can switch to running step by step.

There are multiple ways of defining breakpoints in your code based on your debugger and code editor. There's one universal way to force any JavaScript debugger to pause at a given point. You use the `debugger` statement.

You can add this statement at any point in your code, like this:

:::code language="javascript" source="../code/add-debugger-statement.js" highlight="3":::


## Node.js inspect mode

Because a debugger has full access to the execution environment, a malicious actor could also use it to inject arbitrary code in your Node.js process. That's why, by default, Node.js doesn't allow you to debug a running program. You have to enable a special mode called *inspector* mode to allow debugging.

You need the `--inspect` option to allow a Node.js process to listen for a debugger client that attaches itself to the process and takes control of your program execution.

By default, when Node.js is started with the `--inspect` option, it listens on host 127.0.0.1 on port 9229. You can also specify a custom host and port by using the syntax `--inspect=<HOST>:<PORT>`.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Avoid binding the Node.js debugger port to a public IP address or to 0.0.0.0. Otherwise, any clients that can connect to your IP address could potentially connect and control your Node.js process. By doing so, an attacker can remotely run arbitrary code on your execution environment. This action could lead to a potentially severe security breach.

As an alternative, you can use the `--inspect-brk` option. It works the same as `--inspect`, but it breaks code execution just before the start of your code.

After Node.js is started with inspect mode enabled, you can use any compatible debugger clients to connect to your Node.js process.

### Timeout error from node inspect 

If the `node inspect` or `node --inspect` command returns a timeout error, you can try to install the inspect mode globally for your system to resolve the issue. For installation options, see [How to install Node.js](https://nodejs.dev/en/learn/how-to-install-nodejs).


## Built-in debugger

For example, you can use [node-inspect](https://github.com/nodejs/node-inspect). This command-line debugger comes bundled with Node.js. You can use it by running your program like this:

```bash
node inspect <YOUR_SCRIPT>.js
```

The node-inspect debugger runs Node.js with inspect mode enabled and launches at the same time as the integrated interactive debugger. It pauses execution just before your code starts. You should see the debugger prompt that indicates it has successfully launched.

```bash
node inspect myscript.js
< Debugger listening on ws://127.0.0.1:9229/ce3689fa-4433-41ee-9d5d-98b5bc5dfa27
< For help, see: https://nodejs.org/en/docs/inspector
< Debugger attached.
Break on start in myscript.js:1
> 1 const express = require('express');
  2
  3 const app = express();
debug>
```

You can now use one of the multiple commands to control the execution of your program:

- `cont` or `c`: Continue. Continues the execution until the next breakpoint or the end of your program.
- `next` or `n`: Step next. Executes the next line of code in the current context.
- `step` or `s`: Step in. Same as `next`, except that if the next line of code is a function call, go to the first line of this function's code.
- `out` or `o`: Step out. If the current execution context is inside the code of a function, execute the remaining code of this function and jump back to the line of code where this function was initially called.
- `restart` or `r`: Restart. Restarts the program and pauses the execution before the start of your code.

To set or clear breakpoints in your code, use the following commands:

- `setBreakpoint()` or `sb()`: Add a breakpoint on the current line.
- `setBreakpoint(<N>)` or `sb(<N>)`: Add a breakpoint on line number *N*.
- `clearBreakpoint('myscript.js', <N>)` or `cb('myscript.js', <N>)`: Clear the breakpoint in the file `myscript.js` on line number *N*.

To get information about the current execution point, run these commands:

- `list(<N>)`: List your source code with *N* lines before and after the current execution point.
- `exec <EXPR>`: Evaluate an expression within the current execution context. This command is useful to help you get information about the current state. For example, you can get the value of a variable named `i` by using `exec i`.

Those are quite a few commands to remember. Thankfully, you can also use the `help` command to show the complete list of available commands. To exit the debugger at any time, press <kbd>Ctrl+D</kbd>, or select the command `.exit`.
