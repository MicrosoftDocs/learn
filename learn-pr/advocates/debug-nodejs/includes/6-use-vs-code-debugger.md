It's time to put into practice your newly acquired debugging knowledge. It turns out we have the perfect opportunity. In our Tailwind Traders app, we're developing a new feature to allow a product's price to display in multiple currencies. A coworker wrote some code for it, but they're having a hard time trying to figure out what's going wrong. Let's help.


## Create a JavaScript file in a Visual Studio workspace

For this exercise, you need a JavaScript file to practice debugging. To use the debugger launch controls, the JavaScript file must be in a Visual Studio workspace.

The goal of the application is to set the exchange rate between three currencies, USD, EUR, and JPY. Then, we want to display how much value `10 EUR` is in the other currencies by using two digits after the decimal point. For every currency added, the exchange rate for all other currencies should be calculated.

1. In Visual Studio Code, create a file named  `mycurrency.js` at the `./nodejs-debug/` subfolder.

1. Paste the following code into the new file editor:

    ```javascript
    const rates = {};

    function setExchangeRate(rate, sourceCurrency, targetCurrency) {
      if (rates[sourceCurrency] === undefined) {
        rates[sourceCurrency] = {};
      }

      if (rates[targetCurrency] === undefined) {
        rates[targetCurrency] = {};
      }

      rates[sourceCurrency][targetCurrency] = rate;
      rates[targetCurrency][sourceCurrency] = 1 / rate;
    }

    function convertToCurrency(value, sourceCurrency, targetCurrency) {
      const exchangeRate = rates[sourceCurrency][targetCurrency];
      return exchangeRate && value * exchangeRate;
    }

    function formatValueForDisplay(value) {
      return value.toFixed(2);
    }

    function printForeignValues(value, sourceCurrency) {
      console.info(`The value of ${value} ${sourceCurrency} is:`);

      for (const targetCurrency in rates) {
        if (targetCurrency !== sourceCurrency) {
          const convertedValue = convertToCurrency(value, sourceCurrency, targetCurrency);
          const displayValue = formatValueForDisplay(convertedValue);
          console.info(`- ${convertedValue} ${targetCurrency}`);
        }
      }
    }

    setExchangeRate(0.88, 'USD', 'EUR');
    setExchangeRate(107.4, 'USD', 'JPY');
    printForeignValues(10, 'EUR');
   ```

1. To save the file, press <kbd>Ctrl+S</kbd> (Windows, Linux) or <kbd>Cmd+S</kbd> (Mac).

## Create a launch configuration

We're going to use the debugger a lot, so let's create a launch configuration for your app.

1. On the **Run** tab in Visual Studio Code, select **Create a launch.json file** and select the Node.js debugger. 

   Visual Studio Code creates the `.vscode/launch.json` configuration file at the root of the workspace and opens the launch file for editing.

   :::image source="../media/launch-configuration.png" alt-text="Screenshot of generated launch configuration.":::

   By default, a launch configuration is created to execute the currently opened file. In this example, the open file is `mycurrency.js`. You can modify the launch configuration to customize how your program should start when you're debugging.

1. In the launch configuration, view the value of the `program` property. 

    ```json
    {
        // Use IntelliSense to learn about possible attributes.
        // Hover to view descriptions of existing attributes.
        // For more information, visit: https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=830387
        "version": "0.2.0",
        "configurations": [
            {
                "type": "node",
                "request": "launch",
                "name": "Launch Program",
                "skipFiles": [
                    "<node_internals>/**"
                ],
                "program": "${workspaceFolder}/nodejs-debug/mycurrency.js"
            }
        ]
    }
    ```

    * `${workspaceFolder}` indicates the root of the workspace. 


1. Close the `.vscode/launch.json` file.

> [!Note]
> You can create different launch configurations for your project by selecting **Add Configuration** at the bottom right.


## Analyze the issues

Make sure your Visual Studio Code environment is ready to monitor the debugging process:

- The debugger panel should be open on the left. Use the **Run** tab icon on the left to toggle visibility of the panel.
- The debug console should be open at the bottom. You can open the console by selecting **View** > **Debug Console**, or by pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Y</kbd> (Windows, Linux) or <kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Y</kbd> (Mac).

Now, you're ready to start debugging.

In the debugger launch controls, start the program with debugging enabled (the green arrow).

   :::image source="../media/start-debugging.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Start debugging button in Visual Studio Code.":::

You should see the program finish quickly. That's normal because you haven't added any breakpoints yet.

You should see this text in the debug console, followed by an exception.

```text
The value of 10 EUR is:
11.363636363636365
- 11.363636363636365 USD
/app/node-101/currency.js:23
  return value.toFixed(2);
               ^
TypeError: Cannot read property 'toFixed' of undefined
    at formatValueForDisplay (/app/node-101/currency.js:23:16)
    at printForeignValues (/app/node-101/currency.js:32:28)
    at Object.<anonymous> (/app/node-101/currency.js:40:1)
    at Module._compile (internal/modules/cjs/loader.js:959:30)

    at Function.Module.runMain (internal/modules/cjs/loader.js:1047:10)
    at internal/main/run_main_module.js:17:11
```

What this program aims to do is set the exchange rate between three currencies (USD, EUR, JPY), and display the value for `10 EUR` in all the other currencies, with two digits after the decimal point.

We can see two bugs here:

- There are more than two digits after the decimal point.
- The program crashed with an exception and failed to display the `JPY` value.

> [!TIP]
> - Set `"outputCapture": "std",` to your launch configuration file to increase logging output.
> - Set a **logpoint** instead of a breakpoint to avoid stopping the program execution. A logpoint does not "break" into the debugger but instead logs a message to the console. Logpoints are especially useful for injecting logging while debugging production servers that cannot be paused or stopped.


## Fix the digits display

We'll start by fixing the first bug. Because you didn't write this code and there are different functions called, let's first understand the execution flow by using step-by-step execution.

### Use breakpoints and step-by-step execution

To add a breakpoint, select in the left margin at line **39**, on `printForeignValues(10, 'EUR');`.

:::image source="../media/add-breakpoint.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the breakpoint location in the code.":::

Start debugging again, and step into the `printForeignValues()` function with the **Step into** debug control:

:::image source="../media/step-into.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Step into button.":::


### Check the variables state

Now, take some time to inspect the different variable values in the **Variables** pane.

:::image source="../media/variables-panel.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Variables pane.":::

- What are the values for the `value` and `sourceCurrency` variables?
- For the `rates` variable, do you see the three expected keys, `USD`, `EUR`, and `JPY`?

To advance step by step until the `convertedValue` variable is set, use the **Step over** debug control:

:::image source="../media/step-over.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Step over button.":::

After you use the **Step over** control five times, you should see the value of the `convertedValue` variable be set as expected `11.363636363636365`.

If we step over one more time, we'll see the value of the `displayValue` variable. The value should be the formatted string for display with two digits `11.36`.

We can then conclude that up to this point in the program, the functions `convertToCurrency()` and `formatValueForDisplay()` seem correct, and they return the expected result.


### Correct the mistake

Use the **Step into** control once to reach the call to the `console.info()` function. Examine this line of code carefully. Do you see the mistake here?

We need to fix this program bug by using the `displayValue` variable instead of the `convertedValue` variable to print the value.

1. Update your `currency.js` file to use the correct the variable name. Change the call to the `console.info()` function on line 32 to use the `displayValue` variable instead of the `convertedValue` variable:

   ```javascript
   console.info(`- ${displayValue} ${targetCurrency}`);
   ```

1. Save the changes to your file.

1. Restart the program.

Check that the program correctly displays the `USD` value as `11.36`. First bug - solved.


## Find the cause of the crash

Let's now find out why the program is crashing.

1. In your `currency.js` file, remove the breakpoint that you set on line 39.

1. To force the program to pause after the exception is raised, in the **Breakpoints** pane, check the **Uncaught Exceptions** box.

1. Run the program in the debugger again.

The program should pause on the exception and show a large error report in the middle of the editor window.

:::image source="../media/exception.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the exception message shown in Visual Studio Code.":::

Look at the line where the execution stopped, and notice the exception message `TypeError: Cannot read property 'toFixed' of undefined`. From that message, you can deduce that the `value` parameter function has the value `undefined` instead of being a number. This error is what caused the exception.


### Rewind the call stack

The *stack trace* you see under the error message can be a bit difficult to decipher. The good news is that Visual Studio Code processes the function call stack for you. By default, it shows only the meaningful information in the **Call stack** pane. Let's use call stack information to find the code that led to this exception.

We know that the exception was thrown in the call to the `formatValueForDisplay()` function.

1. In the debugger panel, go to the **Call stack** pane.

1. To see where the `formatValueForDisplay()` function was called, double-click the function under it - the `printForeignValues` function.

   Visual Studio Code goes to the line in the `printForeignValues` function in your `currency.js` file, where the `formatValueForDisplay()` function was called:

   ```javascript
   const displayValue = formatValueForDisplay(convertedValue);
   ```

Look closely at this line of code. The parameter that causes the exception comes from the `convertedValue` variable. You need to find out at what point this parameter value becomes `undefined`.

One option is to add a breakpoint at this line, and then inspect the variable every time the breakpoint stops at this line. But, we don't know when the wrong value might occur, and in complex programs, this debugging approach can be cumbersome. Let's look at an alternate method.


### Add a conditional breakpoint

What would be helpful in our case is to be able to make the debugger stop at this breakpoint only when the value of the `convertedValue` variable is `undefined`. Fortunately, Visual Studio Code can do this action with right mouse click options. 

1. In your `currency.js` file, in the left margin on line 31, right click and select **Add Conditional Breakpoint**.

   :::image source="../media/conditional-breakpoint.png" alt-text="Screenshot of setting a conditional breakpoint in Visual Studio Code.":::

1. After you right-click, enter the following condition to trigger the breakpoint, and then press <kbd>Enter</kbd>:

   ```javascript
   `convertedValue === undefined`
   ```
   
1. Restart the program.

The program should now stop on line 31, and we can examine the call stack values.


### Observe the current state

Let's take some time to analyze the current program state.

- The value of the `convertedValue` variable comes from the call to the `convertToCurrency(value, sourceCurrency, targetCurrency)` function. We need to check the parameter values in this function call and confirm they're correct.

- In particular, we need to examine the `value` variable and confirm it has the expected value `10`.

Take a look at the code of the `convertToCurrency()` function.

```javascript
function convertToCurrency(value, sourceCurrency, targetCurrency) {
  const exchangeRate = rates[sourceCurrency][targetCurrency];
  return exchangeRate && value * exchangeRate;
}
```

You know that the result of this code is `undefined`. You also know that the `value` variable is set to `10`. This information helps us see that the issue must be with the value of the `exchangeRate` variable. 

In your `currency.js` file, hover over the `rates` variable to take a peek:

:::image source="../media/peek-at-variable.png" alt-text="Screenshot of peeking at the rates variable value.":::

You try to get the exchange rate from `EUR` to `JPY`, but if you unfold the `EUR` value, you can see that there's only a conversion rate for `USD`. The conversion rate for `JPY` is missing.


## Fix missing conversion rates

Now that you know some conversion rates are missing, let's understand why. To remove all existing breakpoints, in the **Breakpoints** pane, select the **Remove all breakpoints** icon.

:::image source="../media/remove-all-breakpoints.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the button to remove all breakpoints.":::


### Watch the rates variable

Let's set a breakpoint to watch the `rates` variable.

1. In your `currency.js` file, add a breakpoint on line `37` in the `setExchangeRate(0.88, 'USD', 'EUR');` function.
 
1. In the **Watch** pane, select **Plus**, and enter `rates`.

   Every time the value of the `rates` variable is changed, the updated value is shown in the **Watch** pane.

1. Restart the program.

1. When the breakpoint stops at the first call to `setExchangeRate()` function, use the **Step over** control.

1. In the **Watch** pane, look at the value of the `rates` variable.

   At this point, `USD` and `EUR` have matching opposite conversion rates, as we expected.

1. Step over again at the second call to the `setExchangeRate()` function.

   You see that `USD` and `JPY` have matching opposite conversion rates, but there's nothing between `EUR` and `JPY`.

It's time to look at the code for the `setExchangeRate()` function.

```javascript
function setExchangeRate(rate, sourceCurrency, targetCurrency) {
  if (rates[sourceCurrency] === undefined) {
    rates[sourceCurrency] = {};
  }

  if (rates[targetCurrency] === undefined) {
    rates[targetCurrency] = {};
  }

  rates[sourceCurrency][targetCurrency] = rate;
  rates[targetCurrency][sourceCurrency] = 1 / rate;
}
```

The most important lines in this function are the last two. It seems you've found the second bug! The conversion rates are only set between the `sourceCurrency` and `targetCurrency` variables. The program also needs to calculate the conversion rate for the other currencies that were added.


### Fix the code

Let's fix the code for the conversion rate issue.

1. Update your `currency.js` file to calculate the conversion rate for the other currencies.

   Replace the code on lines 12 and 13:

   ```javascript
   rates[sourceCurrency][targetCurrency] = rate;
   rates[targetCurrency][sourceCurrency] = 1 / rate;
   ```

   with this updated code:

   ```javascript
   for (const currency in rates) {
     if (currency !== targetCurrency) {
       // Use a pivot rate for currencies that don't have the direct conversion rate
       const pivotRate = currency === sourceCurrency ? 1 : rates[currency][sourceCurrency];
       rates[currency][targetCurrency] = rate * pivotRate;
       rates[targetCurrency][currency] = 1 / (rate * pivotRate);
     }
   }
   ```

1. Save the changes to your file.

The updated code sets the conversion rate for any currencies other the `sourceCurrency` and `targetCurrency`. The program uses the conversion rate of the `sourceCurrency` to deduce the rate between the other currency and `targetCurrency`. The code then sets the conversion rate for the other currency accordingly.

> [!NOTE]
> This fix only works if the rates between `sourceCurrency` and other currencies already exist, which is an acceptable limitation in this case.


### Test the correction

Let's test our change.

1. Remove all breakpoints and watch variables.

1. Restart the program.

You should now see the expected result in the console without any crash.

```console
The value of 10 EUR is:
- 11.36 USD
- 1220.45 JPY
```

That's it. You fixed the code. You can now efficiently debug code you didn't even know beforehand by using Visual Studio Code. Well done!

## Cleanup development container

After completing the project, you may wish to clean up your development environment or return it to its typical state.
