Edsger Dijkstra once said:

As a developer at the enormous online retailer called Tailwind Traders, you're going to be writing a lot of Node.js bugs. That's okay because that's just part of coding.

In this module, you'll learn how to effectively debug Node.js programs. The faster you can find and identify bugs, the faster you can get your code to a working state. You'll spend less time scratching your head wondering why your code worked five seconds ago but doesn't work now.

## Learning objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

* Use the Visual Studio Code debugger with a Node.js program.
* Create breakpoints and run your code step by step to find issues.
* Inspect your program state at any execution step.
* Rewind the call stack to find the source of an exception.

Ultimately, you'll be able to find bugs effectively in your Node.js programs, and you won't need to rely only on `console.log` anymore.

## Prerequisites

Local installations of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) and [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)
