As a developer, you probably want to spend most of your time coding new features. Finding and fixing bugs is what will often prevent you from doing that. You experienced how using debuggers can be an effective strategy to debug issues in your Node.js programs. With either the built-in debugger for quick sessions or the Visual Studio Code debugger for more complex projects, you saw how to locate and fix those bugs. You learned how to do it even without knowing the code you're debugging beforehand.

In this module, you learned how to:

- Use built-in and Visual Studio Code debuggers with a Node.js program.
- Create breakpoints and run your code step by step to find issues.
- Inspect your program state at any execution step.
- Analyze the call stack to find the source of an exception.
