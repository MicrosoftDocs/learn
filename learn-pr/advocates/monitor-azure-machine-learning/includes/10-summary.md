This module gave you an overview of monitoring in Azure Machine Learning. You learned that Azure Machine Learning consists of resources in Azure, such as compute and workspace, and how to check metrics for these resources. You also learned how to enable diagnostic settings for an Azure Machine Learning workspace, so that you can query logs from the Azure Machine Learning resources. Finally, you learned why it's important to monitor the machine learning models to prevent them from becoming obsolete and stale.
