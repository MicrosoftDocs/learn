In this module, you learned about building, deploying, and maintaining your Spring Boot application on Azure Container Apps. We discussed the key steps involved in launching the PetClinic project on Container Apps, highlighting how to effectively utilize the Java stack to streamline your development process. We also explored best practices for managing application resources and implementing monitoring solutions to maintain the health of your application in the cloud.

## Clean up resources

When you no longer need the resources, you can remove them to avoid Azure charges by using the following command:

```azurecli
az group delete --name $RESOURCE_GROUP
```
