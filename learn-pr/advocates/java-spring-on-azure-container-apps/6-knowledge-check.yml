  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
    - content: "What is the purpose of setting the environment variable spring.profiles.active to postgres in the Azure Container Apps configuration?"
      choices:
        - content: "It enables Azure Container Apps to automatically connect to any available PostgreSQL database instance."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Setting spring.profiles.active does not automatically connect to any PostgreSQL database; the database connection still needs to be configured manually."
        - content: "It activates a specific Spring profile that configures the application to use PostgreSQL instead of the default H2 database."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "This is correct; the spring.profiles.active variable activates the PostgreSQL configuration within the Spring application."
        - content: "It creates a new PostgreSQL database automatically if one is not already specified."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "This is incorrect; setting the profile does not create a new PostgreSQL database"
        - content: "It sets a default admin password for the PostgreSQL database."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "This answer is incorrect as the profile setting does not impact the PostgreSQL database password."
    - content: "What benefits does enabling the Java Stack in Azure Container Apps provide for your Java applications?"
      choices:
        - content: "Automatic memory fit tailored for Java applications, optimizing resource usage."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Correct. Java Stack includes automatic memory fitting, optimizing memory usage for Java applications."
        - content: "Access to built-in JVM metrics for tracking memory usage, garbage collection, and thread count."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Correct. Java Stack provides JVM-level metrics that help monitor application health and performance."
        - content: "Built-in Java diagnostics tools to monitor application health and performance."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Correct. Built-in diagnostics tools are part of Java Stack, enabling deeper monitoring and troubleshooting."
        - content: "All of the above."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct. All of the listed features are benefits provided by the Java Stack in Azure Container Apps."
    - content: "When deploying the Spring Petclinic application on Azure Container Apps, which resource is automatically set up to enable centralized logging and monitoring for the application?"
      choices:
        - content: "Azure Cosmos DB"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. Azure Cosmos DB is a database service and is not automatically set up for logging or monitoring in Azure Container Apps."
        - content: "Log Analytics workspace"
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct. A Log Analytics workspace is automatically created during deployment to collect logs and monitor the application's performance."
        - content: "Azure Front Door"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. Azure Front Door is a global load balancer and is not automatically created when deploying applications in Azure Container Apps."
