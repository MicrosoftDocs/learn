You’ve already gotten a story going in the Fabrikam pitch deck. Now you need to think about a demo. A demo should be compelling and reflect the story you’re telling, with an emphasis on the solution your product provides. It should hit points of innovation, disruption, and differentiation in your product.

## Have a plan

Firstly, don't run through the prototype without a plan. You want to carefully map out each aspect of the prototype you want to demonstrate and ensure you've documented the perfect flow through it. For Fabrikam, we might:

1. Launch the app.
2. Select an image to use as a search source.
3. Search the image and return the items of clothing in it.
4. Select an item and purchase it.

This path shows the typical journey of a user through the product.

## What to show

Ensure the demo shows the key user flows in your product. Coordinate what you demonstrate with the solution you've articulated to the problem. It should call out the unique features of your product or its differentiation from other products.

It's also important to think about a live demo versus a "canned demo." A "canned demo" is prerecorded or staged. If you're worried about the product crashing or failing, then a "canned demo" is an option, but remember it's not likely to inspire confidence in your audience. It's always best to show a normal user's experience.

## What's next

Conclude your demonstration with a quick walkthrough of your product road map. The product road map is the list of future features you'd like to develop for your app. For Fabrikam, this road map might include:

* Social sharing of matched fashions
* Integration with more payments platforms
* And so on

The road map is especially important if your prototype lacks a key feature that represents product differentiation; for example, if you haven't built it yet.
