We created the Fabrikam pitch deck using the following process:

1. Expanded on our "elevator pitch" to include the story, the problem, our solution, and why we're the right people to solve it.
1. Identified our audience and tailored our message to their interests.
1. Explained how Fabrikam's business will work and how we'll make money.
1. Demonstrated our prototype, showing our audience the key features.
1. Made the "ask" of our audience for what we need to grow our business.

We now have a compelling pitch for our product prototype. We'll have convinced the audience of our potential, the value of our app, and gotten the investment we need to grow our business.
