## For beginners

Visual Studio is the preferred IDE for beginner C# or C++ developers. The tooling for these languages is first class, and many hints are built in just to keep new users on track. It helps you find the right templates with good descriptions when you're creating a different app type (mobile, gaming, and IOT apps for example). It provides versioning help and UI for managing your project properties. You can easily create and navigate git repos. These are all small, helpful things Visual Studio can do for you.

## For professional developers

Visual Studio is used by millions of professional, full-time developers every day. They use it to build everything from major games to mobile apps, business software to airline operations.

## For anyone

Use Visual Studio if you want a fully integrated development experience on your local machine. The Community edition is free for students, open-source contributors, and individuals. There's a Professional license for developers working in teams and an Enterprise license that has even more features packed into the IDE.
