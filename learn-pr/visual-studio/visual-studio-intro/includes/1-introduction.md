In this introduction, we'll cover the most frequently used tools in the Visual Studio IDE (integrated development environment). This powerful IDE brings intuitive and cutting-edge programming tools to your finger tips. This tutorial is for Visual Studio and not Visual Studio Code, but it will cover the differences and advantages of each. We'll also cover the many ways IDEs empower your developer flow beyond writing code with quality analysis, extensions, and built-in publishing tools.

## Example scenario

Suppose you're just starting to learn programming, or you're new to Visual Studio developer tools. You know a good way to start is by building your first website. It can be a place you can post blogs, keep your resume, or help people get in contact with you. Generally, it can be a space that friends, recruiters, or coworkers can find to get to know you better.

You might've watched some videos online, or maybe even coded some of your first Python, JavaScript, or C# code. There's a ton of great learning tools for coding these languages. Some tools like [interactive docs](/dotnet/csharp/tour-of-csharp/tutorials/hello-world?tutorial-step=1) execute entirely in the browser. You want to take the next step and run code on your computer locally. You've learned you'll need a code editor or an integrated development environment (IDE) to code and compile on your own computer, and you're ready to dig in! The first step is understanding what tools you'd like to use for programming and how they can help you code a great app.

## What will we be doing?

Visual Studio brings the best of development environments to your programming flow. This quick introduction will familiarize you with the tools included in this advanced coding editor, including:

* What's Visual Studio? (and how's it different from Visual Studio Code?)
* What's in Visual Studio?
  * Editor
  * Debugger
  * Customization
  * Extensions
  * Live Share
  * Publishing tools
  * And more!
* When should I use Visual Studio?

## What's the main goal?

By the end of this module, you'll be more familiar with Visual Studio as an integrated development environment. You'll know when to use the powerful tool to help you code, debug, and publish your apps.
