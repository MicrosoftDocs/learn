### Summary
###
### Length:
###   - Write 2 sentences.
###   - Total length should be 20-25 words; up to 35 is acceptable.
###   - To keep it brief, avoid teaching, omit motivation, and remove "learn", "in this module", and title words.
###
### Sentence 1:
###   Goal: List key features of the product covered here. Omit less-important parts or group low-level parts into one higher-level element.
###   Pattern: "Describe the (list of covered features) that (perform the key product use-case)."
###   Example 1: "Describe the function of (connectors, triggers, and actions) and show how you (combine them to create an app)."
###   Example 2: "Survey GitHub (notifications, branches, commits, and pull requests) that help you (collaborate, build, and deploy software)."
###
### Sentence 2:
###   Goal: Describe how the module will achieve the 'evaluate' task.
###   Pattern: "Characterize the types of (problem) that (product) can (solve)".
###   Example 1: "Characterize the types of (business processes) that (Logic Apps) can (automate)."
###   Example 2: "Determine the types of (software projects) for which (GitHub) is a (good development platform)."
###
### Detailed guidance: https://review.docs.microsoft.com/help/learn/id-guidance-introductory-summaries?branch=master
###
summary: "Describe the common best practices, theory, and anti-patterns of writing tests. Characterize the types of problems that testing can solve for your repository."

###
### Learning Objectives
###
### Write 2 Learning Objectives, one that fits each pattern shown below.
###
### Learning Objective 1:
###   Goal: Express that 'evaluate' is the terminal learning objective of an "Introduction to (product)" module.
###   Pattern: "Evaluate whether (product) is right for (general-type-of-problem-solved-by-product)."
###   Example: "Evaluate whether (Logic Apps) is appropriate to (automate your business processes)."
###
### Learning Objective 2:
###   Goal: Express that the learner will be able to describe how the product works to perform a task.
###   Pattern: "Describe how (feature(s)) of (product) (solve problem)."
###   Example: "Describe how (the components) of a (Logic App) work together to (launch your app and implement your business logic)."
###
### Notes:
###   - The YAML element name here is 'abstract' but it must contain your Learning Objectives.
###   - Do not edit the lead-in sentence ("By the end of this module, you'll be able to:").
###   - Start each objective with an upper-case letter.
###   - End each objective with a period.
###
### Detailed guidance: https://review.docs.microsoft.com/help/learn/id-guidance-learning-objectives?branch=master
###
abstract: |
  By the end of this module, you'll be able to: 
  - Evaluate if testing is right for your scenarios.
  - Describe how different types of testing, the testing pyramid, and different testing schools of though answer the demands of modern development.

### Prerequisites
###   - List the skills learners need to have before starting this module.
###
### Guidance summary:
###   - Do not require any knowledge of the product being covered.

###   - Avoid ambiguity, e.g. say "Ability to write HTML at a novice level" rather than "Familiarity with HTML".
###   - Be concrete: e.g. say "Familiarity with programming concepts such as loops, conditionals and variables" rather than "Familiarity with programming concepts".
###   - Do not mention or link to other content that teaches the required prerequisite skills.
###   - If needed, include software setup requirements with setup links.
###
