  questions:
  - content: Say you have one method that you'd like to test with multiple different inputs. What testing tool could help you?
    choices:
    - content: "Data driven tests"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "You're correct! Data driven tests can reduce repetition in your code by letting you run a test with multiple different inputs."
    - content: "Mocking"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Not quite! Try again."
    - content: "No framework is needed, you should copy and paste the test multiple times and only change the parameters."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Not quite! Try again."
  - content: Stubs and shims are found in what testing tool?
    choices:
    - content: "Fluent Assertions"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Not quite! Try again."
    - content: "Data driven tests"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Not quite! Try again."
    - content: "Mocking"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! Mocking uses stubs and shims to isolate code so you're only testing one specific piece of your project at a time."
