title: Secure Unity Catalog objects
summary: Unity Catalog provides centralized governance and security for data assets in Azure Databricks. This module explores how to secure Unity Catalog objects through access control strategies, fine-grained permissions, credential management, and authentication mechanisms. You'll learn how to implement table and schema-level security, enforce row and column filtering, securely access secrets from Azure Key Vault, and authenticate data access using service principals and managed identities.
abstract: |
  By the end of this module, you'll be able to:
  - Understand the query lifecycle in Unity Catalog and how security is enforced
  - Implement access control strategies using inherited and explicit permissions
  - Apply fine-grained access control through row filtering and column masking
  - Securely access Azure Key Vault secrets in Azure Databricks workflows
  - Authenticate data access using service principals
  - Configure managed identities for secure resource access without managing credentials
prerequisites: |
  The following prerequisites should be completed:
  * Basic understanding of Azure Databricks and Unity Catalog concepts
  * Familiarity with SQL and data access patterns
  * Knowledge of Microsoft Entra ID and Azure security fundamentals
