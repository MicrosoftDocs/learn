  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "What is the primary purpose of Unity Catalog during the query lifecycle?"
    choices:
    - content: "To store all table data in a centralized location"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Unity Catalog manages metadata and security, not the actual table data storage."
    - content: "To validate permissions and generate scoped temporary access tokens"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Unity Catalog acts as the control plane for security, validating permissions and issuing scoped tokens for authorized data access."
    - content: "To execute all queries on behalf of users"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Queries are executed by compute resources like clusters or SQL warehouses, not Unity Catalog."
  - content: "Which permission is required to create a new table in a Unity Catalog schema?"
    choices:
    - content: "CREATE TABLE on the catalog only"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Creating a table requires permissions at multiple levels."
    - content: "SELECT on the schema and CREATE TABLE on the catalog"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. SELECT is not sufficient; the correct combination includes USE CATALOG, USE SCHEMA, and CREATE TABLE."
    - content: "USE CATALOG on the catalog, USE SCHEMA on the schema, and CREATE TABLE on the schema"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Creating a table requires USE CATALOG on the catalog, USE SCHEMA on the schema, and CREATE TABLE on the schema."
  - content: "What is the primary advantage of Row and Column Security over Dynamic Views?"
    choices:
    - content: "Row and Column Security can combine data from multiple tables"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Dynamic Views are better suited for combining data from multiple tables."
    - content: "Row and Column Security minimizes object sprawl by enforcing security at the table level"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Row and Column Security reduces the number of objects to manage by applying masking and filtering functions directly to tables, avoiding the need for multiple views."
    - content: "Row and Column Security provides read-only access to data"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Row and Column Security supports both read and write operations with security enforcement."
  - content: "What happens when a secret stored in Azure Key Vault is updated?"
    choices:
    - content: "All Databricks clusters automatically pick up the new value immediately"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Clusters cache secret values and must be restarted to fetch updated values."
    - content: "The secret scope in Databricks must be recreated to access the new value"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The secret scope itself doesn't need to be recreated."
    - content: "Clusters must be restarted to fetch the updated secret value"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Clusters cache secret values when they start, so you must restart the cluster for it to retrieve the updated value from Azure Key Vault."
  - content: "Why does Microsoft recommend managed identities over service principals for Unity Catalog storage credentials?"
    choices:
    - content: "Managed identities are less expensive than service principals"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Cost is not the primary reason for this recommendation."
    - content: "Managed identities eliminate the need to manage and rotate secrets and can access network-protected storage"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Managed identities remove credential management overhead and can access storage accounts protected by network rules, which service principals cannot."
    - content: "Managed identities provide faster data access than service principals"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Performance is not the primary difference between these authentication methods."
  - content: "Which Azure role should be assigned to a managed identity to enable Unity Catalog to read and write data in Azure Data Lake Storage?"
    choices:
    - content: "Reader"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The Reader role provides read-only access to Azure resources metadata, not blob data access."
    - content: "Storage Blob Data Contributor"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The Storage Blob Data Contributor role provides read and write access to blob data, which is required for Unity Catalog operations."
    - content: "Contributor"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While the Contributor role is powerful, the more specific Storage Blob Data Contributor role is the appropriate choice for blob data access."
