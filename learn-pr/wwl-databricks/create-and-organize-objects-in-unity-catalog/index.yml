title: Create and organize objects in Unity Catalog
summary: Unity Catalog's three-layer namespace—catalogs, schemas, and objects—provides a flexible foundation for organizing data assets while maintaining centralized governance. This module explores how to create catalogs for environment isolation, organize schemas within those catalogs, and create tables, views, and volumes for structured and unstructured data. You'll learn to implement foreign catalogs for external database access, apply effective naming conventions, and configure AI/BI Genie instructions to enhance data discoverability.

  - Create managed and external tables, views, and volumes in Unity Catalog
  - Implement DDL operations including functions and stored procedures
  - Implement foreign catalogs to access external database systems
  - Configure AI/BI Genie instructions for natural language data discovery
prerequisites: |
