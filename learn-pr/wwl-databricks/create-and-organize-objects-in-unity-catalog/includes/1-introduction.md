Your organization needs to manage data across development, testing, and production environments while enforcing clear security boundaries. Different teams require access to different datasets, and business users need a way to discover and query data without writing complex SQL. **Unity Catalog** provides a **three-layer namespace**—catalogs, schemas, and tables—that lets you organize data assets with precision while maintaining centralized governance.

Creating and organizing Unity Catalog objects establishes the foundation for your data platform. You start by designing **catalogs** that separate environments or business domains, then organize **schemas** within those catalogs to group related datasets. Within schemas, you create **tables** for structured data and **volumes** for files, applying consistent naming conventions that make your data discoverable. Advanced features like **foreign catalogs** connect external databases, while **AI/BI Genie instructions** help business users interact with your data using natural language.

By the end of this module, you'll be able to design and implement a comprehensive Unity Catalog structure that scales with your organization's needs while maintaining clear governance boundaries.
