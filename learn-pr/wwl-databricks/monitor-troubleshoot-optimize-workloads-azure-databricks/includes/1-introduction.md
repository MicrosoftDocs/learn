Running data workloads in Azure Databricks at scale requires more than setting up clusters and writing pipelines—it demands continuous attention to resource consumption, job health, and performance optimization. When compute costs climb unexpectedly, jobs fail without clear explanations, or queries that once ran quickly now take hours, you need systematic approaches to identify problems and apply targeted fixes.

Azure Databricks provides comprehensive tools for monitoring and troubleshooting across all compute types. **Cluster metrics** reveal CPU, memory, and network utilization patterns that help you right-size resources. **The Spark UI** exposes job execution details, stage-level metrics, and task distributions that pinpoint bottlenecks. **System tables** enable you to query billing data and usage patterns directly, supporting cost attribution and chargeback processes.

Performance issues often trace back to common patterns: **data skew** that overloads a few tasks while others sit idle, **memory spill** that forces expensive disk operations, **excessive shuffle** that moves data unnecessarily across the network, or **caching problems** that cause repeated reads from remote storage. Understanding how to investigate these issues using the DAG visualization, Spark UI metrics, and query profiles helps you restore performance efficiently.

For enterprise-scale environments, **log streaming to Azure Log Analytics** centralizes diagnostic and audit data from across your Azure Databricks workspaces. This integration enables powerful KQL queries for troubleshooting, proactive alerting for critical events, and comprehensive visibility into platform operations.

Throughout this module, you explore cluster consumption monitoring, Lakeflow Jobs troubleshooting, Spark job diagnostics, performance optimization techniques, and log streaming configuration to build the skills needed to keep your Azure Databricks workloads running reliably and cost-effectively.
