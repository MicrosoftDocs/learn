Azure Databricks architecture provides a flexible foundation for data engineering workloads through its hierarchical organization and separation of **control and compute planes**. Throughout this module, you explored how accounts organize resources across workspaces and metastores, how **Unity Catalog** governs data centrally, and how different compute models serve specific needs. The **control plane** handles orchestration while **compute planes**—whether **serverless** or **classic**—process your data in isolated, secure environments.

Storage patterns in Azure Databricks have evolved to address different scenarios. **Default storage** simplifies development by providing fully managed storage in serverless workspaces without configuration overhead, though it requires serverless compute for access. **External locations** bridge Unity Catalog with your existing cloud storage, enabling governance over data managed outside Azure Databricks while maintaining security through storage credentials. **Unity Catalog managed storage** gives you control over data placement at catalog and schema levels while Unity Catalog handles the complete lifecycle, including automatic cleanup of managed tables and volumes.

Understanding these architectural components helps you design Azure Databricks environments that align with organizational requirements. The **account hierarchy** provides clear governance boundaries, the separation of planes enables secure scaling, and the storage options let you balance convenience with control. As you implement Azure Databricks solutions, consider how each component serves your specific use cases, evaluate security implications of different storage patterns, and leverage Unity Catalog's governance capabilities to maintain data quality and access control across your organization.
