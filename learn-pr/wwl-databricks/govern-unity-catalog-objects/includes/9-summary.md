Governing Unity Catalog objects requires a comprehensive approach that spans metadata management, access control, compliance, and collaboration. Throughout this module, you explored the tools and techniques that enable effective data governance in Azure Databricks—from documenting your data assets with **comments and tags** to enforcing access policies through **attribute-based access control (ABAC)**. You learned how **governed tags** enable policies that scale automatically as new tables are added to your catalog.

Data lifecycle management emerged as a critical governance capability. You configured **Delta Lake retention settings** and used **VACUUM** to remove obsolete data files. You handled **compliance deletion requests**, propagating deletions through bronze, silver, and gold data layers. **Predictive optimization** automates these maintenance tasks, reducing operational overhead while ensuring storage efficiency.

Understanding your data's journey proved essential for both troubleshooting and compliance. **Data lineage tracking** in Catalog Explorer reveals how data flows through your pipelines, enabling impact analysis before making changes. **Audit logging** through the system table provides visibility into who accessed what data and when, supporting security investigations and regulatory audits. For external collaboration, **Delta Sharing** offers secure data exchange with partners and customers, with options for both Databricks-to-Databricks sharing and open protocol sharing.

Apply these governance practices incrementally as you build your data platform. Start by documenting tables and columns with meaningful comments and tags. Implement ABAC policies for sensitive data classifications. Configure retention policies that balance compliance requirements with storage costs. Review lineage and audit logs regularly to maintain visibility into your data operations. These foundational practices create a governance framework that scales with your organization's data needs.
