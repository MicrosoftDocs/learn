Throughout this module, you explored the complete data engineering workflow for cleansing, transforming, and loading data into **Unity Catalog** tables in Azure Databricks. From initial data profiling to final loading operations, each technique builds on the previous to deliver high-quality, well-structured data ready for analysis.

You learned how **data profiling** using `ANALYZE TABLE` and Unity Catalog's monitoring features reveals data quality issues like null percentages, duplicate records, and distribution anomalies. You explored how selecting **appropriate data types** affects storage efficiency, query performance, and data integrity—particularly the importance of using `DECIMAL` for financial calculations. You practiced identifying and resolving **duplicates and null values** using techniques like `QUALIFY` with window functions, `dropDuplicates()`, and `fillna()` methods.

For data transformation, you applied **filtering, grouping, and aggregation** operations to shape data for analytical requirements. You combined datasets using **joins** for horizontal merging and **set operators** like `UNION`, `INTERSECT`, and `EXCEPT` for vertical combinations. You reshaped data structures through **denormalization** for query performance, **pivoting** for cross-tabular analysis, and **unpivoting** to normalize wide datasets.

Finally, you implemented **loading strategies** that match your data scenarios: `INSERT INTO` for appending new records, `INSERT OVERWRITE` for replacing data, and `MERGE INTO` for upsert operations that synchronize changes. As you build data pipelines, apply these techniques systematically—profile first to understand your data, cleanse to resolve quality issues, transform to meet analytical requirements, and load with the appropriate strategy to maintain data integrity in your lakehouse.
