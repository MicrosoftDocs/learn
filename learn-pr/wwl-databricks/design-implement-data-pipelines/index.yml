title: Design and implement data pipelines
summary: Learn to design and implement robust data pipelines in Azure Databricks using notebooks and Lakeflow Declarative Pipelines, covering orchestration, error handling, and task logic.
abstract: |
  By the end of this module, you'll be able to:
  * Design the order of operations for data pipelines from ingestion to serving.
  * Choose between notebooks and Lakeflow Declarative Pipelines based on use cases.
  * Design task logic, dependencies, and execution patterns for Lakeflow Jobs.
  * Implement error handling strategies, including retry policies and expectations.
  * Create data pipelines using both notebooks and Lakeflow Declarative Pipelines.
prerequisites: |
  The following prerequisites should be completed:
  * Basic understanding of Azure Databricks workspaces
  * Familiarity with Unity Catalog fundamentals and governance concepts
  * Knowledge of SQL and data organization principles
