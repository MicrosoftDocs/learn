Designing and implementing data pipelines in Azure Databricks requires understanding both the conceptual framework and the practical tools available. Throughout this module, you explored the **order of operations** that guide reliable pipeline design—from data ingestion through cleaning, transformation, loading, and serving. You learned how the **medallion architecture** provides a structured approach where each stage builds on validated data from the previous stage, ensuring data quality and maintainability.

Choosing between **notebooks** and **Lakeflow Spark Declarative Pipelines** depends on your specific requirements. Notebooks offer flexibility for complex business logic, rapid prototyping, and custom integrations. Lakeflow Spark Declarative Pipelines reduce operational complexity by automatically managing orchestration, incremental processing, and dependency analysis. Many production environments benefit from combining both approaches—using notebooks for specialized processing while declarative pipelines handle core ETL workflows.

Task logic design in **Lakeflow Jobs** enables sophisticated workflow patterns. You configured **task dependencies** to control execution order, implemented **conditional branching** with If/else tasks, and used **For each** tasks for iterative processing. **Error handling** proved essential for production reliability—you applied data quality expectations in declarative pipelines, configured retry policies and notifications at the job level, and implemented exception handling in notebook code.

Apply these concepts by starting with clear pipeline architecture that matches the medallion model. Choose the pipeline approach that fits your team's skills and the complexity of your transformations. Design task dependencies that maximize parallelism while respecting data relationships. Implement error handling strategies that protect data quality and enable rapid recovery when failures occur. These practices form the foundation for building data platforms that scale with your organization's needs.
