title: Select and Configure Compute in Azure Databricks
summary: Azure Databricks provides multiple compute options optimized for different workloads. This module explores how to choose the right compute type, configure performance settings, manage access permissions, and install libraries. You'll learn when to use serverless versus classic compute, how to optimize clusters for cost and performance, and best practices for securing compute resources.
