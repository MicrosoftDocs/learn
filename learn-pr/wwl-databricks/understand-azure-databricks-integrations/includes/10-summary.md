Azure Databricks becomes more powerful when integrated with the Microsoft ecosystem. Throughout this module, you explored seven integrations that extend your data lakehouse capabilities across analytics, development, applications, and AI services. Each integration serves specific use cases while maintaining Unity Catalog as the central governance layer.

You learned how Microsoft Fabric and Power BI enable business intelligence, letting analysts create reports from Databricks data. The Visual Studio Code integration transforms development by enabling local coding with remote execution and debugging. Power Platform and Copilot Studio bring governed data into applications and AI agents, making lakehouse data accessible through familiar interfaces. Microsoft Purview provides unified governance, while Microsoft Foundry connects AI agents with analytical insights.

Understanding the security models, authentication methods, and limitations of each integration helps you design solutions that balance accessibility with governance. As you implement these patterns, match integration choices to specific business scenarios, evaluate security implications carefully, and test configurations thoroughly. The combination of Azure Databricks with Microsoft services creates comprehensive data and AI solutions that serve diverse needs while maintaining centralized governance and quality standards.
