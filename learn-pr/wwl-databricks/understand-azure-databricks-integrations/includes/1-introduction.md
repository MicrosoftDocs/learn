Azure Databricks excels at large-scale data processing and machine learning, but modern data solutions require integration with business intelligence tools, application frameworks, and AI services. Understanding how Azure Databricks connects with the **Microsoft ecosystem** helps you design comprehensive solutions that leverage the strengths of each platform.

Microsoft provides multiple integration points with Azure Databricks. You can connect **Microsoft Fabric** for unified analytics, publish data to **Power BI** for interactive reporting, develop locally with **Visual Studio Code** while executing on remote clusters, build applications with **Power Platform**, create AI agents in **Copilot Studio**, implement governance with **Microsoft Purview**, and orchestrate AI workflows with **Microsoft Foundry**. These integrations maintain your governance policies while extending data access across your organization.

The key to successful integration lies in choosing the right pattern for each scenario. **Security models** vary—some pass through individual user credentials to enforce fine-grained permissions, while others use **service principals** for consistent access. Each integration preserves **Unity Catalog** as the central governance layer, but enforcement mechanisms differ based on the consuming service's architecture.

In this module, you explore seven integrations between Azure Databricks and Microsoft services. You learn how each works, when to apply it, and what security considerations matter while maintaining the governance and quality standards your organization requires.
