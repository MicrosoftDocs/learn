- uid: learn.language.typescript-implement-interfaces.badge
  type: badge
  title: Implement interfaces in TypeScript
  summary: JavaScript doesn't support interfaces so, as a JavaScript developer, you may or may not have experience with them. In TypeScript, you can use interfaces as you would in traditional object-oriented programming. You can also use interfaces to define object types and this is the primary focus of this module.

- uid: learn.language.typescript-generics.badge
  type: badge
  title: Define generics in TypeScript

- uid: learn.language.build-javascript-applications-typescript.trophy
  type: trophy
  title: Build JavaScript applications using TypeScript
  summary: TypeScript offers all the features of JavaScript, plus an additional layer on top of these - the TypeScript type system. In this learning path, you’ll learn how using TypeScript for JavaScript development can help you build more robust code, reduce runtime type errors, take advantage of modern features before they are available in JavaScript, and work better with development teams.

- uid: learn.language.typescript-declare-variable-types.badge
  type: badge
  title: Declare variable types in TypeScript
  summary: JavaScript is a dynamically typed language. While this makes declaring variables easy, it can in some cases lead to unexpected results. The static type system in TypeScript enables you to describe the shape of an object, providing better documentation, and allowing TypeScript to validate that your code is working correctly. In TypeScript, declarations of namespaces, classes, properties, functions, variables, and other language entities associate types with those entities. The way that a type is formed and associated with a language entity depends on the kind of entity. This module introduces some of the available types and shows how to associate them with variables. Later modules examine how interfaces, functions, and classes use static typing.

- uid: learn.language.typescript-declare-instantiate-classes.badge
  type: badge
  title: Declare and instantiate classes in TypeScript
  summary: Classes in TypeScript extend the ES6 functionality by adding TypeScript-specific features like type annotations for class members, access modifiers, and the ability to specify required or optional parameters. Another benefit of using TypeScript is that you can use it to develop with classes and then compile them down to JavaScript that works across all major browsers and platforms, as needed.
