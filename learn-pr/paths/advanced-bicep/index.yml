summary: |
  Bicep enables you to deploy Azure resources. Bicep uses a declarative syntax that you treat like application code.
  Treating your infrastructure as code enables you to track changes to your infrastructure requirements and makes your
  deployments more consistent and repeatable.

  Take this learning path to understand how you can use Bicep with complex deployment scenarios. In it, you'll:

  * Deploy advanced Azure resource types, and understand the Azure resource model.
  * Deploy resources at the subscription, management group, and tenant level.
  * Build deployment scripts that define custom steps in your Bicep templates.
  * Ensure reusability, consistency, and compliance by creating libraries of modules and templates.
