title: Intermediate Bicep
summary: |
  Bicep enables you to deploy Azure resources. Bicep uses a declarative syntax that you treat like application code.
  Treating your infrastructure as code enables you to track changes to your infrastructure requirements and makes your
  deployments more consistent and repeatable.

  Take this learning path to deepen your understanding of Bicep. In it, you'll:

  * Deploy child and extension resources.
  * Add your Bicep code to the Git version control system to track its history and collaborate with team members.
  * Follow proven best practices to create high-quality Bicep code.
  * Use pull requests to review your team's Bicep code.
  * Use the what-if command to check the effects of your Bicep files before you deploy them.
  * Migrate JSON ARM templates to Bicep to make your existing Azure deployment templates easier to read and maintain.
  * Use Bicep to work with resources you've previously deployed using the Azure portal or other tooling to make your deployments repeatable and consistent.
