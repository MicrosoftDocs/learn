  In this learning path, you will:
  - Create a basic release pipeline that deploys a web application to Azure App Service.
  - Build a more complete pipeline that deploys to multiple development and testing stages.
  - Run functional and non-functional tests that verify your application's behavior and performance.
  - Choose and implement an appropriate deployment pattern to smoothly roll out new features to your users.
  - Extend pipelines to add support for different deployment targets, such as Azure Functions.
  - Automate Docker and multi-container Kubernetes deployments with Azure Pipelines.
