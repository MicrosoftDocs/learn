title: Discover the role of Python in space exploration
summary: | 
  This learning path introduces you to the world of Python. But the goal is not to learn Python, the goal is to understand how Python plays a role in the innovative solutions that NASA creates. Through the lens of space discovery, this learning path could ignite a passion to persistently learn, discover, and create so that you too can one day help us all understand a little more about the world beyond our Earth.
  
  Through these modules, you will:
  
  - Understand and install the tools needed to learn programming
  - Learn core programming concepts and apply them to real-life NASA problems
  - Gain knowledge about cutting-edge technologies like machine learning and artificial intelligence
  - See actual NASA employees talk about their job and give advice

  > [!TIP]
  > This learning path is part of a multimodal learning experience. Start the first module to see how you can follow along!
