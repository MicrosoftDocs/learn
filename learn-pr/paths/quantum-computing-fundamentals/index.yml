summary: |
  Welcome to the world of quantum computing!

  Whether you're a developer or simply someone who wants to get a feel for what quantum computing is all about, this learning path is a great place to start exploring quantum computing.

  Imagine you're the new member of a space crew. The spaceship is equipped with a computer that has access to the Azure Quantum servers on Earth and you can use the power of quantum to complete different tasks. During your training as a new crew member, you'll learn about quantum computing and how to use the Microsoft Azure Quantum service.

  Welcome aboard!

  After completing this learning path, you'll be able to:
  - Explain the fundamental concepts of quantum computing.
  - Identify the kinds of problems quantum algorithms can solve more efficiently than classical algorithms.
  - Build basic quantum programs by using the Quantum Development Kit and Q#.
  - Interact with the Azure Quantum cloud service.
  - Adapt and create Q# applications to run them on actual hardware.
  - Estimate physical resources for quantum algorithms using Azure Quantum
