title: Get started with Azure Quantum
summary: |
  Welcome to the world of quantum computing!

  Whether you're a developer or simply someone who wants to get a feel for what quantum computing is all about, this learning path and Azure Quantum are the best combo to start exploring quantum computing.
  
  After completing this learning path, you'll be able to:
  - Explain the fundamental concepts of quantum computing.
  - Identify the kinds of problems quantum algorithms can solve more efficiently than classical algorithms.
  - Build basic quantum programs by using the Quantum Development Kit and Q#.
  - Interact with the Azure Quantum cloud service.
  - Adapt and create Q# applications to run them on actual hardware.
  - Estimate physical resources for quantum algorithms using Azure Quantum.

prerequisites: |
  - Basic knowledge of Azure ecosystem
  - Basic knowledge of linear algebra
  - Familiarity with Visual Studio Code
