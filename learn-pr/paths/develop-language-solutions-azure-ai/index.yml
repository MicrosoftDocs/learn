title: Develop natural language solutions in Azure
prerequisites: |
  Before starting this learning path, you should already have:
  *   Familiarity with Azure and the Azure portal.
  *   Experience programming with C# or Python.
  If you have no previous programming experience, we recommend you complete the [Take your first steps with C#](/training/paths/csharp-first-steps/) or [Take your first steps with Python](/training/paths/python-first-steps/) learning path before starting this one.
summary: |
  Natural language solutions use language models to interpret the semantic meaning of written or spoken language, and in some cases respond based on that meaning. You can use the Language service to build language models for your applications, and explore Azure AI Foundry to use generative models for speech.
