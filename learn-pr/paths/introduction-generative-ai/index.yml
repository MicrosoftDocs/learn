summary: |
  Generative AI is a form of artificial intelligence in which models are trained to generate new original content based on natural language input. In other words, you can describe a desired output in normal everyday language, and the model can respond by creating appropriate text, image, code, and more.

  - Understand core concepts of generative AI
  - Prepare for an AI development project
  - Describe considerations and practices for responsible generative AI
  - Build an AI agent using Azure AI Foundry
