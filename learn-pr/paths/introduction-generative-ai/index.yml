title: "Microsoft Azure AI Fundamentals: Generative AI"
summary: |
  Generative AI is a form of artificial intelligence in which models are trained to generate new original content based on natural language input. In other words, you can describe a desired output in normal everyday language, and the model can respond by creating appropriate text, image, code, and more. 

  Take this learning path to get started with generative AI. In it, you'll:
  - Understand how language models form the foundation of generative AI
  - Describe how Azure AI Studio provides access to the latest generative AI technology
  - Understand how generative AI applications, such as copilots, support efficiencies
  - Describe copilot prompts and responses 
  - Describe how Microsoft's responsible AI principles drive ethical AI advancements
prerequisites: Familiarity with Azure and the Azure portal.
