summary: |
  In this path, you'll learn to build the Machine Teaching for Autonomous AI brains that you learned to design in the “Autonomous AI Design Architect” learning path. Starting from the AI specification document of a use case, you'll learn to build, train, and test brains using the Microsoft Project Bonsai platform. You'll see firsthand the differentiated benefits of the Bonsai platform:
  - a low-code platform with a graphical interface
  - automatic selection and training of Deep Reinforcement Learning solutions that prevent unlearning
  - automatic integration with simulations
  - self-embedded scaling of up to 1000 parallel simulations
  - flexible integrated deployment into production, through local or cloud integration.
  
  In future expansions of this path, well also present Machine Teaching Experimentation, the iterative process of implementing, validating results, and modifying brain design, until the brain reaches expected performance. designs to diverse stakeholders.

  At the end of this learning path, you'll be able to:
  - Build Autonomous AI brains in the Project Bonsai platform.
  - Train Autonomous AI brains with monolithic and modular brain structures.
  - Validate brain training and performance using the training graph and custom assessments, respectively.
  - Visually understanding brain performance using embedded graph interfaces.
