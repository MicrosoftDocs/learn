title: 'Protect Azure AI Foundry solutions by using Microsoft Defender for Cloud'
prerequisites: |
  - Experience managing Azure subscriptions, workloads, and Defender for Cloud plans
  - Familiarity with Azure AI Foundry and how AI workloads are deployed in Azure
  - Understanding of basic cloud security principles, including posture management, access control, and incident investigation
summary: |
  As AI workloads become central to business operations, they introduce new security challenges that traditional cloud tools do not fully address. 
  
  In this learning path, you learn how to:
  - Understand AI workload risks and how Microsoft Defender for Cloud identifies and protects AI assets
  - Enable the AI Workloads plan and use Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) to discover and remediate misconfigurations
  - Use Cloud Workload Protection (CWP) to detect runtime threats targeting AI components
  - Investigate AI security alerts in Microsoft Defender XDR
  - Configure and manage guardrails in Azure AI Foundry to prevent unsafe or policy-violating model behavior

  Together, these capabilities help cloud and security engineers safeguard AI workloads from data leakage, model abuse, and evolving threats.
