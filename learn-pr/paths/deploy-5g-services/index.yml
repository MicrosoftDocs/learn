title: Deploy 5G services with Azure
summary: |
  Over the last 40 years, mobile networks have evolved in parallel to the internet. The next evolution of the mobile network (5G) is more than 100 times faster than the existing networks (4G / LTE). However, 5G is more than faster networks. It represents a fundamental change in architecture. 

  Through the deployment of 5g technologies, the capabilities of mobile networks and the internet are converging. Azure developers can now create innovative applications by leveraging the new capabilities of 5G networks. 5G networks represent a fundamental change in architecture. They empower Enterprise Azure developers to create low latency, high-bandwidth applications.

  The combination of 5G and Azure provides value to the enterprises in a variety of ways. You can create end-to-end 5G services for high bandwidth, low latency applications such as IoT Edge applications for high sensor density. You could also deploy live video analytics, which depends on low latency. All these services can be developed using familiar Azure tools.

  Typically, you deploy new 5G based services as a partnership between an enterprise, a network operator, and a systems integrator.  Participants in the collaborative 5G ecosystem will avail of various benefits.

  For example:
    - **Enterprise customers** benefit from having access to a portfolio of Azure services and its vibrant developer ecosystem. In addition, enterprises can access 5G through a fully integrated technology stack and use tools they are already familiar with.
    - **Telco and System Integrator partners** access the Azure developer ecosystem and an integrated way to deploy 5G edge services to the enterprise. They can also access supporting products and services through the marketplace.
    - Finally, **Application ISVs (systems integrators)** can get a fully-featured platform to develop ultra-low latency applications and distribute their applications at scale through the marketplace.
  
  For Enterprise deployments of 5G, **Azure private Multi-access Edge Compute (Azure Private MEC)** is the primary interface to 5G. Azure private MEC enables you to create new services and business models for 5G by creating new enterprise services such as low latency IoT services, live video analytics, so on. 

  Written from the perspective of Azure developers, in this learning path, we explore the capabilities of 5G technologies for enterprises and the new services that can be enabled through 5G.

  Here, you will explore questions such as:
    - How can Azure developers take advantage of the new features of 5G to create compelling enterprise applications leveraging their existing knowledge?
    - How can Azure developers create network-aware applications that provide more than simple connectivity? 
    - How can they simplify their application development process by using low-code tools? 
    - How can they use a single dashboard view for on-premises and cloud-based deployments?
    - What technology choices and trade-offs do Azure developers for 5G need to make?
    - How can enterprises and mobile network operators leverage the unique capabilities of fusion core and APNS (Affirmed private network service) – which are based on the Metaswitch and Affirmed networks acquisitions?

  The learning path includes the following modules:
    - Introduction to 5G for Azure in the Enterprise	
    - Enterprise 5G technologies for Azure Cloud Services	
    - Enterprise 5G technologies for Azure Cloud Services
    - Introduction to Azure Sphere for industrial IoT connectivity

  Since 5G is a rapidly evolving space, we expect this learning path to evolve to include other Azure technologies that complement enterprise 5g.
