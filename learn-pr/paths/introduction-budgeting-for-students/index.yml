title: Introduction to budgeting for students
prerequisites: None
summary: |
  Ariel Atkins, WNBA player and founder of the Ariel Atkins Foundation, was inspired by a conversation with kids in DC about how to make money and improve their circumstances. She realized that while we teach the value of hard work, we often overlook the essential skill of managing and growing the money earned.
 
  This self-led, online curriculum, created in partnership with Microsoft, expands on the Foundation’s mission by making vital financial education accessible to everyone—free of charge. Through interactive lessons on budgeting, saving, and making smart financial choices, students can take control of their finances and build a better future at their own pace. At the Ariel Atkins Foundation, we believe that understanding money is the key to unlocking limitless possibilities and creating a path to success.
