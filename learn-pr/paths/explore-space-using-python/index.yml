title: Explore space with Python and Visual Studio Code; inspired by Netflix's Over the Moon
summary: | 
  Learning to code sometimes feels out of reach. But if we've learned anything from 
  the people who have burst through our atmosphere, orbited our Earth, or walked on
  the Moon, it's that goals that seem out of reach require determination and passion. 
  In this learning path, we'll draw on these themes from the story line of *Over the Moon*. 
 
  *Over the Moon* is a film about Fei Fei, a young girl who builds a rocket to the Moon 
  on a mission to prove the existence of a legendary Moon Goddess. The girl is fueled 
  by the memories and love of her mother to use determination and imagination to 
  accomplish something beyond this world: reach the Moon. Although the story takes place 
  in a beautifully drawn universe, it's directly related to the types of problems 
  real-life engineers face as they prepare and execute missions to the Moon and beyond.

  These modules were inspired by *Over the Moon* and the story of real NASA
  engineers and astronauts. Tying together principles of data science, machine learning, and
  artificial intelligence with tools like Python, Visual Studio Code, and Azure, these modules
  guide you through upskilling in tech while imagining how to solve space travelâ€“related 
  challenges. And don't forget
  to watch *[Over the Moon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26DIABx44Tw?azure-portal=true)* on Netflix today!
  
  Through these modules, you will learn how to:
    - Aggregate data from multiple sources into pandas DataFrames
    - Use Python to explore, cleanse, and manipulate your data
    - Ensure ethical practices throughout AI development
    - Train a Custom Vision AI model on a particular animal

  > [!TIP]
  > This learning path is part of a multimodal learning experience. Start the first module to see how you can follow along!
