summary: |
  New to the cloud? Azure Fundamentals teaches you basic cloud concepts, provides a streamlined overview of many Azure services, and guides you with hands-on exercises to deploy your very first services for free.

  We recently released a refreshed set of Azure Fundamentals learning paths that enable you to choose the topic areas you're interested in most. Begin your journey to the cloud with the [Azure Fundamentals part 1: Describe core Azure concepts](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/paths/az-900-describe-cloud-concepts/) learning path.

  This older version is available for those who are trying to complete it but will be removed at some point in the future.

  In this learning path, you will:
    - Learn cloud concepts such as High Availability, Scalability, Elasticity, Agility, Fault Tolerance, and Disaster Recovery
    - Understand the benefits of cloud computing in Azure and how it can save you time and money
    - Compare and contrast basic strategies for transitioning to the Azure cloud
    - Explore the breadth of services available in Azure including compute, network, storage, and security
  
  For specific training for the AZ-900 certification and information on how to register for the exam, see [AZ900 Microsoft Azure Fundamentals Exam](https://www.microsoft.com/learning/exam-AZ-900.aspx).
