title: Introduction to Python for data science
summary: |
  Welcome to the introduction to Python for data science. The modules in this learning path pair with in-person workshops that run in Microsoft Reactors, and they're also standalone learning resources. That is, you don't have to come to a workshop to benefit from them.

  Throughout this learning path, you'll be encouraged to try out Python code in Visual Studio Code by using the Python extension and Jupyter Notebook.

  In this learning path, you will:
    - Learn about Python for data science
    - Understand the basics of using the NumPy and pandas libraries
    - Clean and manipulate data to prepare for analysis
    - Work with your data in Visual Studio Code by using Jupyter Notebook

  This learning path is complementary content for Microsoft Reactor Workshops.
