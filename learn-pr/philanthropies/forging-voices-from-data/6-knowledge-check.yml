      choices:
      - content: "To build, customize, and deploy AI-powered language models and dialogue systems"
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "Azure OpenAI Studio provides tools for designing, testing, and refining AI-driven applications using models like GPT."
      - content: "To design 3D characters for video games"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Azure OpenAI Studio is focused on text-based AI, not 3D asset creation."
      - content: "To manage web hosting and domain registration"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Web hosting is unrelated to Azure OpenAI Studio's dialogue system capabilities."

    - content: "What is one key benefit of using Azure for deploying AI-powered chatbots?"
      choices:
      - content: "It allows scalable deployments and seamless integration with other Microsoft services"
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "Azure's infrastructure supports enterprise-scale deployments and offers integration with services like Power Automate and Cognitive Services."
      - content: "It automatically animates characters during dialogue"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Azure OpenAI Studio focuses on language models, not animation or motion graphics."
      - content: "It writes legal contracts from PDF templates"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "While AI can generate text, legal contract automation is not the platform's core use case."

    - content: "How can users tailor a dialogue model to a specific domain?"
      choices:
      - content: "By uploading custom training data such as FAQs, chat logs, or policy documents"
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "Custom data helps fine-tune models so responses are aligned with specific topics, tone, or terminology."
      - content: "By assigning the chatbot a random name and using default prompts"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Personalization and performance come from tailored prompts and training—not randomization."
      - content: "By selecting a visual theme in the Azure dashboard"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Azure OpenAI Studio does not use visual themes—it focuses on natural language input and output."

    - content: "Why is it important to customize system prompts when building a chatbot?"
      choices:
      - content: "To shape the assistant's tone, behavior, and response style"
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "System prompts provide instruction to guide the model's personality and communication style."
      - content: "To allow the model to design its own data sets"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "The model doesn't create training data on its own—it learns from what you provide."
      - content: "To automatically translate dialogue into different languages"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Prompt customization controls behavior—not translation, which would require additional services."

    - content: "What does real-time testing in Azure OpenAI Studio allow you to do?"
      choices:
      - content: "Evaluate and refine chatbot responses before deployment"
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "Real-time testing lets developers simulate interactions, identify gaps, and improve performance."
      - content: "Create animated facial expressions for each message"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Facial animation is not part of Azure OpenAI Studio's functionality."
      - content: "Publish chatbots directly to the Apple App Store"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Azure enables backend deployment—you'll need other platforms for app distribution."
