## Summary

In this module, learners explored how to build, train, and refine custom AI-powered dialogue systems using Azure OpenAI Studio.

The session began with an overview of the platform’s capabilities, highlighting its integration with the Microsoft ecosystem and support for advanced models like GPT-3, GPT-4, and Codex. Learners then walked through the end-to-end process of creating a dialogue system—from account setup and model selection to dataset training and prompt customization.

Key focus areas included:
- **Fine-tuning AI behavior** to match specific use cases by using domain-specific data and targeted examples.
- **Handling context and memory** to ensure multi-turn conversations feel natural and coherent.
- **Personalization techniques** like tone control, adaptive suggestions, and dynamic variables to make interactions more engaging.
- **Enhancing realism** by incorporating sentiment awareness, empathy, and continuous feedback loops for iterative improvement.

By the end of the module, learners gained hands-on experience designing dialogue systems that are not only functional, but also coherent, empathetic, and tailored to user needs. This foundation prepares them to deploy scalable, user-friendly assistants that can operate across platforms and evolve through real-world interaction.
