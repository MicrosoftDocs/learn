In this session, learners will explore the full lifecycle of designing, customizing, and deploying AI-powered dialogue systems using **Azure OpenAI Studio**. Building on their foundational understanding of conversational AI, participants will learn how to select models, train them with custom data, and refine their outputs through real-time testing.  

The session covers not only the technical steps involved in setting up a dialogue system but also the creative techniques that bring conversations to life—like personalization, tone control, and contextual memory. By the end, learners will have hands-on knowledge of how to create intelligent, human-like assistants that can scale across digital platforms.

## Scenario

Imagine you’ve been asked to develop a virtual assistant for a university’s advising department. The assistant needs to help students find answers about academic policies, course schedules, and campus resources.

Using **Azure OpenAI Studio**, you:
- Set up a custom instance and select a language model suited to the assistant’s scope.
- Upload FAQs and policy documents, training the model to reflect the university’s tone and terminology.
- Customize system prompts to match the university’s professional yet welcoming voice.
- Monitor interactions as students use the assistant, refining its responses based on feedback to improve clarity and engagement.

With each iteration, you improve the assistant’s ability to serve students effectively.

## What will we be doing?

We’ll walk through the end-to-end process of designing and training a dialogue model in **Azure OpenAI Studio**:

- **Explore**: What is Azure OpenAI Studio, and how can it be used to create powerful dialogue systems?
- **Select**: How do you choose between GPT-3, GPT-4, and Codex for your use case?
- **Train**: How can you fine-tune a model using custom datasets and feedback loops?
- **Customize**: What techniques can make dialogue feel more personal, human, and engaging?
- **Deploy**: How do you test, evaluate, and improve your assistant across real-world scenarios?


## What is the main goal?

By the end of this session, learners will be able to:
- Build and train custom dialogue systems using **Azure OpenAI Studio**
- Personalize responses and maintain context across conversations
- Continuously refine and improve their systems for real-world deployment
