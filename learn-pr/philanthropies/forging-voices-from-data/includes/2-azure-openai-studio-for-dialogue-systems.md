### What Is Azure OpenAI Studio?

Azure OpenAI Studio gives you an interactive space to work with models like GPT-3, GPT-4, and Codex. You can quickly design, test, and launch AI-powered applications that understand and generate human-like language.

**Key Features:**
- **Prompt Playground** — Test prompts live and see how the model responds.
- **Custom Deployments** — Create and manage model endpoints for real apps.
- **Secure Infrastructure** — Built on Azure, offering top-level security and compliance.

**Why Use Azure?**
- **Scalable** — Easily handle thousands of users at once.
- **Integrated** — Connect smoothly with other Azure services (like Logic Apps or Power Automate).
- **Real-Time Testing** — Check and improve model behavior right inside the Studio.

Azure OpenAI Studio helps you move smoothly from idea to production, all in one place.
