Transparency and accountability are key to driving sustainability in datacenters. Many operators are now adopting comprehensive monitoring and reporting frameworks to track their environmental impact. Metrics such as Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE), Water Usage Effectiveness (WUE), and Carbon Usage Effectiveness (CUE) are used to measure and report on energy and resource efficiency. These metrics help datacenters identify areas for improvement and demonstrate their commitment to sustainability to stakeholders.

## Using KPIs to track progress toward environmental goals

- **Power usage effectiveness (PUE):** Measures how efficiently a datacenter uses energy, with lower values indicating better efficiency.

- **Water usage effectiveness (WUE):** Tracks the amount of water used for cooling per unit of IT output.

- **Carbon usage effectiveness (CUE):** Measures carbon emissions relative to IT workload.

- **Real-time energy monitoring**: Tools like Schneider Electric's EcoStruxure and AWS CloudWatch help monitor energy consumption and identify inefficiencies.

- **Reporting frameworks:** Alignment with global standards such as the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP), or Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi).
