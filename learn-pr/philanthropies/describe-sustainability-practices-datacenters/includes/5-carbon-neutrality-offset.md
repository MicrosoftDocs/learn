## Achieving carbon neutrality

Carbon neutrality means balancing the amount of carbon dioxide (CO2 ) emitted with equivalent reductions or removals elsewhere, achieving net-zero emissions.

- Direct emission reduction: Measures like switching to renewable energy, optimizing energy use, and improving cooling systems to cut emissions at the source. 

- Residual emissions offsetting: For emissions that cannot be eliminated, companies invest in offset projects such as reforestation, renewable energy developments, or carbon capture technologies.

## Renewable energy credits (RECs)

Datacenters purchase RECs to offset energy consumed from non-renewable sources.

## Carbon capture and storage (CCS)

Emerging technologies to directly capture and store carbon emissions from operations.

## Offset strategies

- **Renewable energy credits (RECs):** Certificates that represent one megawatt-hour (MWh) of electricity generated from renewable sources. Datacenters purchase RECs to offset their energy usage.

- **Carbon offsets:** Investments in projects that reduce greenhouse gases, such as wind farms, solar installations, or methane capture systems.

- **Net-zero datacenters:** Examples include Microsoft's goal to become carbon negative by 2030 and Google's commitment to operating 24/7 carbon-free by 2030.

## Innovative technologies for carbon capture

- **Direct air capture (DAC):** Technologies that extract CO2 directly from the atmosphere, storing it underground or repurposing it for industrial uses.

- **Carbon storage:** Collaborations like Equinor's Northern Lights project capture and store carbon emissions from industrial facilities.
