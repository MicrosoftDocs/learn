Focus on minimizing waste and making the most of resources. By adopting these principles, datacenters can significantly reduce their environmental impact and promote sustainability.

## E-waste Management

- **Hardware recycling:** Partnering with certified recycling programs to safely dismantle and reuse components from retired hardware. Amazon Web Services (AWS) has implemented an innovative approach to hardware recycling through its re:Cycle Reverse Logistics hubs. These hubs are designed to disassemble, refurbish, and resell old datacenter technology. AWS has successfully diverted more than 99% of its retired equipment from landfills, ensuring that valuable materials are recovered and reused

- **Refurbished equipment**: Using refurbished servers and components to extend hardware life and reduce manufacturing demand. BrightStar Systems specializes in buying, selling, and refurbishing used datacenter equipment. By refurbishing servers, routers, switches, and other components, they extend the hardware's life and reduce the demand for new manufacturing. This approach not only provides cost savings but also promotes sustainability by reducing e-waste.

## Lifecycle Optimization

- **Predictive maintenance**: Using AI and IoT sensors to predict hardware failures and maximize lifespan. An excellent example of predictive maintenance in datacenters is the approach taken by NTT Data. They use AI and IoT sensors to monitor equipment conditions in real-time, predicting potential hardware failures before they occur. This proactive strategy helps maximize the lifespan of the equipment, reduces downtime, and enhances overall efficiency.

- **Resource recovery:** Extracting valuable materials, like gold and rare earth metals, from discarded hardware for reuse. An example of resource recovery in datacenters is the approach taken by Dell Technologies. Dell has implemented a comprehensive recycling program that focuses on extracting valuable materials, such as gold, silver, and rare earth metals, from discarded hardware. This program not only reduces e-waste but also recovers precious materials for reuse in new products, promoting a circular economy and sustainability.

## Reducing Manufacturing Impact

- **Eco-friendly manufacturing**: Using sustainable materials and green manufacturing practices for new hardware. An example of eco-friendly manufacturing in datacenters is the approach taken by Ark Data Centres. They have implemented several sustainable practices, including using steel over concrete to decrease carbon output and incorporating living walls to enhance insulation and biodiversity. Additionally, Ark Data Centres runs its facilities on 100% renewable energy and upholds extensive recycling practices, aiming for zero waste to landfill.

- **Vendor sustainability**: Partnering with suppliers that adhere to environmental standards like ISO 14001 or the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA). An example of vendor sustainability in datacenters is EcoDataCenter. They partner with suppliers that adhere to environmental standards such as ISO 14001 and the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA). This commitment ensures that their entire supply chain operates sustainably, reducing environmental impact and promoting responsible business practices.
