In this module, we focused on the importance of sustainability in datacenter operations. We explored the use of renewable energy sources like solar and wind, and strategies for optimizing energy usage and emergency power systems. 

The module also covered advanced cooling techniques, including waste heat reuse and water conservation practices. Additionally, we learned about monitoring and reporting tools for tracking sustainability progress through KPIs and examined real-world case studies showcasing successful innovations in green datacenter design and operations.
