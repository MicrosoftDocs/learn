AI-powered tools can personalize learning by creating individualized plans, providing real-time feedback, and enhancing the engagement and understanding of your learners.

Here are some examples of how you can use AI-powered tools to personalize learning:

- You can ask your learners to record themselves while reading aloud. Reading Progress can make notes of all the words that are challenging to the learner, and then provide visual aids and extra reading exercises to help them improve. You can save time by not having to evaluate your learners one at a time.

- AI tutors can provide real-time answers to queries at any time of day. A personalized AI tutor can adapt to each learner's level of knowledge and learning speed. AI tutors can alleviate workloads and ensure learners receive timely support, fostering a more supportive learning environment.

- You can expand your teaching with mixed reality, allowing learners to immerse themselves in experiential learning and dive deeper into each subject. HoloLens VR dissection enables learners to practice complex surgeries in a risk-free virtual environment. Virtual field trips take learners to museums, archaeological sites, and various geographical locations. These are only two examples of how learning can incorporate mixed reality.

- Interactive smart boards provide a place for you and your learners to collaboratively develop ideas in impromptu or formal way, whether you're teaching remotely, in person, or in a hybrid format. You can keep your learners focused on the right things by annotating for special emphasis. You can also lock your learners' view so that they only see what you see.

- You can use data analytics to keep yourself informed of your learners' engagement rate, learning progress, and well-being. You can monitor group and individual performance, identify learning gaps, and provide timely interventions and support.

Applying AI-powered tools to teaching can increase the quality and accessibility of education. Trainers can use insights and AI-powered tools to help save time on what matters most.
