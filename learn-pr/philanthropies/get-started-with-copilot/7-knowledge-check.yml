          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect: While Copilot assists with various tasks, it is not intended to replace human workers but to enhance productivity and creativity"
        - content: "Microsoft Copilot is a tool exclusively for managing daily schedules and organizing tabs."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect: Although Copilot can help with managing schedules and organizing tabs, its capabilities extend far beyond these functions"
        - content: "Microsoft Copilot is a specialized tool for coding and technical tasks only."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect: Copilot is versatile and assists with a wide range of tasks, including drafting emails, creating content, and learning new things, not just coding"
    - content: "Which of the following strategies is most effective for ensuring an engaging and productive conversation with Microsoft Copilot?"
      choices:
        - content: "Asking vague questions to allow Copilot to interpret the context freely."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect: Vague questions can lead to less relevant responses as Copilot may not understand the specific context or details you need"
        - content: "Providing specific and detailed prompts to receive tailored responses."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct: Specific and detailed prompts help Copilot understand your needs better and provide more relevant and tailored responses."
