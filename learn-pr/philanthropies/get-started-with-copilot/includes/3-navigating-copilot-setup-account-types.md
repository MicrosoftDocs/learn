Your experience with Microsoft Copilot isn't a one-size-fits-all. Whether you're using a personal account or a work or school account, Copilot adapts to provide an experience that's right for your needs. It's compatible with various operating systems and browsers. You can also access Copilot by downloading the Microsoft Copilot app to your phone. To access Copilot from your computer, open a browser and go to copilot.microsoft.com.

You can use a limited version of Copilot without a Microsoft account. However, logging into a Microsoft account using the Microsoft Edge browser provides the best experience. Having an account allows for extended conversations with Copilot. It also allows you to save your conversation history and perform research and summaries of webpages you're viewing.

A work or school account is provided by your employer or school for professional use. Signing in with a work or school account ensures your organization's data is protected and Copilot will redirect you to copilot.cloud.com. If you're using Copilot for work or school-related tasks, you should sign-in with your work or school email. If your organization grants you Copilot privileges, you can also use Copilot in Microsoft 365 applications.

If you don't have an account and need to make one, select on "create one" and follow the steps provided. Once you sign in, you unlock access to extended conversations and more features. Now that you have an account, let's explore the interface.
