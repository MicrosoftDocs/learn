**Provide Background Information**: Context is crucial. Include relevant details about your task, such as the purpose, audience, and any specific requirements you have in mind.

**Specify Sources and Parameters**: If you need information from certain documents or specific data points, mention these explicitly to guide Copilot's search and synthesis process.

**Define Your Preferred Style**: Let Copilot know the tone and style you prefer for your content. This could be formal, casual, technical, or creative, depending on your needs.

**Be Detailed in Your Requests**: The more details you provide, the better Copilot can tailor its responses to meet your expectations. For example, instead of requesting a brief overview, ask for a comprehensive summary with actionable insights.

**Use Clear and Polite Language**: Communicating clearly and courteously helps Copilot understand your needs better and ensures a more accurate response.

**Engage in an Ongoing Dialogue**: Keep the conversation dynamic by asking follow-up questions and providing feedback. This allows Copilot to refine its responses and better align with your requirements.
