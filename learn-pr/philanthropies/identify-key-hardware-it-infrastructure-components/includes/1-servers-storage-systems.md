## Storage options

Data storage is a critical aspect of datacenter operations, supporting a wide range of applications and services. Each storage option—SAN, NAS, and object storage— serves distinct purposes in datacenters, and innovations in this field continue to enhance their performance, scalability, and efficiency. SANs lead in high-performance environments, NAS excels in shared file storage, and object storage dominates in unstructured data and cloud-native applications.  

| Storage Option | Description | Recent innovations |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Storage area networks (SANs)** | SANs are high-speed networks connecting storage devices to servers, offering block-level access for high-performance applications like databases.
