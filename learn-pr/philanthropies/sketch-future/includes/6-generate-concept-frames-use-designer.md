Once you've set a visual direction, the next step is bringing specific scenes to life with concept frames. These frames help you picture key moments in the animation and act as creative references throughout production. With **Microsoft Designer**, you can generate custom concept art for each scene using just a few thoughtful prompts.

## How to write strong prompts for Designer

The results you get from Designer depend on how clearly you describe your vision. A strong prompt usually includes:

- **Scene description** – What's happening in the shot?  
- **Mood or emotion** – What should the audience feel?  
- **Visual style** – What art style fits your story?  
- **Color palette** – Are there key colors or tones?  
- **Framing or perspective** – Is it a wide shot, close-up, overhead view, etc.?

### Example prompt:
"Create a concept frame of a floating bedroom in a dreamy pastel sky. Use a soft painterly style with warm lighting and an overhead view."

Designer gives you several versions based on your input, so you can pick the one that fits best.

## How to create scene-based concept frames

To tell a clear visual story, try making one frame for each major scene or beat in your animation. Each concept frame should highlight:

- The feeling or action in that moment  
- Where characters are placed in the scene  
- Key environmental or stylistic details  

### Example sequence for a music video:

1. **Opening:** A character wakes up in a floating bed surrounded by clouds  
1. **Midpoint:** They walk through a pastel forest filled with glowing plants  
1. **Climax:** They run across a bridge of stars as the music builds  
1. **Ending:** The character fades into light as the song concludes  

Each of these scenes can be visualized as its own concept frame in Designer.

## Explore style and composition variations

Designer makes it easy to test different visual directions. You can:

- Try out different art styles like watercolor, glitchcore, or retro-futurist  
- Shift the lighting or colors to change the mood  
- Adjust the framing to focus on movement or emotion  

This creative phase helps you find the look that fits your story and music best.

## Why concept frames matter

Concept frames connect your idea to the final animation. They help you explain your vision to collaborators, stay visually consistent, and guide the design of scenes during production. With **Microsoft Designer**, you can create these visuals quickly—making concept development faster, more flexible, and accessible for any skill level.
