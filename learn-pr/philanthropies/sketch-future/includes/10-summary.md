In this module, you explore how to bring an animated concept to life using Microsoft AI tools: **Copilot** and **Designer**. Focusing on preproduction and visual development, the session shows how AI supports and speeds up the early stages of animation planning—from brainstorming ideas to designing visuals.

- **Copilot** helps you organize creative ideas into structured animation roadmaps, including scene breakdowns, asset lists, and simple planning workflows tailored to your project.  
- **Designer** allows you to generate high-quality concept frames and visual references. You use it to visualize scenes, test out different art styles, and create a consistent look for your animation.

This module shows how AI tools can act as creative partners, improving both speed and originality. By bringing **Copilot** and **Designer** into your workflow, you create a clearer, more actionable vision—ready to guide your project into production with confidence.
