A strong visual identity is essential for any animated project. Style guides help define that identity by documenting the visual rules and references that guide the entire production. With **Microsoft Designer** and other AI tools, you can quickly create, test, and refine the elements that shape your project's unique look and feel.

## What is a style guide?

A style guide is a visual reference that outlines the overall look of an animation. It usually includes:

- Color palettes  
- Font choices  
- Sample character and environment designs  
- Textures and patterns  
- Lighting styles  
- Layout and composition examples  

This guide acts as a blueprint that helps designers and animators keep every visual element consistent across the entire project.

## How to define a visual style using AI

Start by using **Microsoft Designer** to generate images in different styles that match your project's tone. Then choose the visuals that feel the most aligned with your creative direction.

### Example prompt:  
"Generate a series of visuals in a vaporwave-meets-fantasy style featuring glowing urban environments, soft gradients, and mystical elements."

Review the AI-generated results and group the images that reflect your project's desired aesthetic.

## How to refine the visual style

Once you've selected key images, use Designer's editing tools to adjust and fine-tune the look:

- **Color adjustments** – Match visuals to your mood or brand colors  
- **Texture tweaks** – Add or reduce texture depending on whether you want a clean digital look or something more hand-drawn  
- **Framing and layout** – Adjust how visual elements are arranged to highlight key parts of the scene  

This quick, flexible process lets you shape your project's visual identity through fast iterations—perfect for solo creators or collaborative teams.

## Exploring style alternatives with AI

One of the biggest strengths of using AI for visual development is how easily you can explore new directions. By slightly adjusting your prompt, you can test:

- Different art styles (e.g., anime, surrealism, minimalism)  
- Changes in lighting or tone  
- Shifts in setting or influence (e.g., a magical forest vs. a futuristic city)  

This helps you discover creative options without starting over—so your team can experiment freely while staying efficient.

## Why style guides matter

A style guide is like the visual DNA of your project. It makes sure that every frame, character, and background feels like it belongs in the same world. Using AI-generated visuals speeds up this process, making it easier for teams to collaborate, stay consistent, and build a distinct aesthetic—faster and with more creative freedom.
