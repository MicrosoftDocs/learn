**Objective:**  

Use **Microsoft Copilot** to create a storyboard for a short animated sequence, then use **Microsoft Designer** to generate character designs that match the tone and visual style of your storyboard.

## Materials needed

- Laptop or desktop computer with internet access  
- Microsoft Copilot access (via Microsoft Edge)  
- [Microsoft Designer access](https://designer.microsoft.com/image-creator?scenario=texttoimage)

## Part 1: Create a storyboard using Microsoft Copilot

1. **Open Copilot in Microsoft Edge**  
   - Launch Copilot from your browser window.

1. **Write your storyboard prompt**  
   - Example:  
     "Create a storyboard for an animated short set in a futuristic city. Include 5–6 scenes with visual descriptions and suggested camera angles."

1. **Refine your storyboard**  
   - Use follow-up prompts to shape the flow or tone:  
     - "Add more tension in the middle scene."  
     - "Make the story feel more whimsical."  
     - "Include a montage in the opening."

1. **Review and share with a peer**  
   - Discuss the narrative flow, clarity of visuals, and scene structure.  
   - Suggest any changes to pacing, transitions, or framing.

## Part 2: Design characters with Microsoft Designer

1. **Pull style and tone from your storyboard**  
   - Identify the setting (e.g., cyberpunk, noir, pastel sci-fi)  
   - Note key character traits—attitude, role, or emotions to reflect in the design

1. **Generate a character concept**  
   - Use a prompt in Designer like:  
     "Create a character design for a street-smart teen protagonist in a neon-lit futuristic city. Use a bold color palette and show a dynamic pose."

1. **Explore variations**  
   - Try different versions by adjusting the tone or style:  
     - "Soft and dreamy"  
     - "Gritty and angular"  
     - "Retro-futuristic"  
   - Pick your favorite and note what makes it work visually.

1. **Share and discuss**  
   - Show your designs to peers. Talk about how they align with your storyboard.  
   - Reflect on what surprised you about the AI output and how you might adjust your prompts in the future.

## Expected outcome

By the end of the activity, you create a basic storyboard and a matching character design using AI tools. Your final visuals represent the narrative and tone of a short animation. This activity shows how **Copilot** and **Designer** work together to help you plan and visualize early-stage animation ideas.
