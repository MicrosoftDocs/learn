Once you have a core idea for your animated project, the next step is turning it into a structured plan. **Microsoft Copilot** helps you build an animation roadmap by turning your creative ideas into clear, actionable steps. With a few simple prompts, Copilot helps generate scene breakdowns, timelines, and asset lists that guide your entire production.

## What is an animation roadmap?

An animation roadmap is a detailed outline that shows how your project will take shape. It usually includes:

- A short summary of the story or concept  
- A scene-by-scene breakdown  
- A list of visual and audio assets  
- Suggestions for pacing, transitions, and narrative flow  

This roadmap acts as a blueprint. It helps everyone involved understand the creative direction, timeline, and production needs before animation begins.

## Step-by-step: Using Copilot for animation planning

You can use **Copilot in Microsoft Edge** to build your roadmap by entering prompts like the ones below:

1. **Start with your concept.**  
   Example:  
   *"Create an animation plan for a 90-second music video inspired by Cuco's dreamlike style. The theme is personal transformation."*

1. **Break the project into scenes.**  
   Example:  
   *"Divide the animation into five key scenes and describe the visuals and transitions for each one."*

1. **List needed assets.**  
   Example:  
   *"Create a list of visual and audio assets based on this animation plan."*

1. **Request team planning tips.**  
   Example:  
   *"Suggest a timeline and roles for a small creative team working on this animation."*

## How to refine and customize the roadmap

Once Copilot gives you a draft, you can quickly tweak it to match your vision:

- Change the mood or pacing  
  *Example: "Make the transitions slower and more emotional."*  
- Add style preferences  
  *Example: "Use pastel colors and vaporwave-inspired visuals."*  
- Rearrange or combine scenes  
  *Example: "Merge scenes 2 and 3 into a single montage."*

This makes it easy to test ideas and adjust the plan without starting over.

## Why it matters

Planning animation can take a lot of timeâ€”especially when you're trying to organize creative ideas into clear direction. Copilot speeds up the process by giving you a strong first draft that you can build on. Whether you're working alone or with a team, an AI-generated roadmap keeps everyone on the same page, reduces confusion, and brings your vision to life more smoothly.
