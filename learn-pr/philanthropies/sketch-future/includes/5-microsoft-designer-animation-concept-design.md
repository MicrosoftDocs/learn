While **Microsoft Copilot** helps shape the story and structure of an animation project, **Microsoft Designer** focuses on the visual side—helping bring those ideas to life through fast, AI-powered design. During the concept phase of animation, Designer supports visual development by generating artwork, exploring style directions, and keeping a consistent look across scenes and assets.

## What is Microsoft Designer?

Microsoft Designer is an AI-powered visual design tool that creates high-quality graphics from simple text prompts. It's built into Microsoft 365 and powered by generative AI, making professional design more accessible for all creators—no matter their skill level.

For animators and visual storytellers, Designer can be used to create:

- Mood boards and style frames  
- Character and environment concept art  
- Visuals for pitches or promotional materials  
- Storyboard panels that share a consistent look and feel  

## How does Designer help with animation concept development?

In the early stages of animation, strong visuals are essential. Designer supports this creative process by offering:

- **Quick concept generation**  
   You can type a prompt like *"Create a dreamy pastel cityscape at sunset with floating objects"* and get multiple visuals instantly. This makes it easy to explore different directions and build early mood boards.

- **Style exploration**  
   Designer lets you test out various visual styles—like cyberpunk, hand-drawn, painterly, or minimalist—to help you find the tone that fits your project best.

- **Consistency across visuals**  
   You can apply the same style across multiple images, helping your project maintain a unified look. This is especially useful when you're designing multiple scenes, backgrounds, or assets.

- **AI-enhanced refinement**  
   Built-in editing tools let you tweak colors, adjust layouts, or reframe your visuals while keeping the overall aesthetic. This makes it easy to iterate and improve without starting over.

## Why use Designer during animation preproduction?

Designer helps you explore creative ideas visually before committing to full production. Whether you're developing a pitch, testing different art directions, or building a visual reference library, Designer gives you a head start. It speeds up early-stage design, supports creative decisions, and helps bring your animated world to life—one visual at a time.
