In this session, learners explore how to use AI tools for preproduction and visual planning in animated projects. Learners explore how Microsoft tools like **Copilot** and **Designer** support the creative process—from early brainstorming to generating visual assets. Through hands-on demonstrations, participants use these tools to build structured animation roadmaps, design concept art, and create visual style guides. The session encourages learners to combine AI suggestions with their own creative ideas, helping them work more efficiently while keeping their originality.

## Scenario

Imagine you're the creative lead for an animated music video pitch for Cuco's next tour. You need to present a clear visual concept—but you're short on time and working with a small team. You start by listening to the song and writing down ideas about the mood, themes, and story direction.

Next, you open **Microsoft Copilot** to build a detailed animation roadmap. Copilot helps outline key scenes, transitions, and needed assets. Then, you switch to **Microsoft Designer** to create concept frames that show the style and tone of the video. These AI-generated visuals help you explain your vision quickly and clearly to stakeholders—saving time, aligning the team, and making your pitch more compelling.

## What will we be doing?

We explore how AI supports the early stages of animation planning and apply Microsoft tools to build a visual concept:

- **Introduce:** How does AI help with planning and visual storytelling for animation?  
- **Roadmap:** How does Copilot help build a sequence of animated scenes?  
- **Visualize:** How does Microsoft Designer help create mood boards and concept images?  
- **Refine:** How can AI support iterations and style tweaks during development?  
- **Create:** How do we mix AI outputs with our own creative ideas?  
- **Apply:** How do we use these tools in a hands-on activity to design an animation concept?

## What is the main goal?

The goal of this session is to help learners use AI tools like **Copilot** and **Designer** to improve the early planning stages of animation. Participants build storyboards, concept frames, and visual style guides that lay the foundation for a professional animation project.
