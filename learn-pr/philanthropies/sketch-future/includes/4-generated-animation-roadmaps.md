## How AI supports creative planning

Using Copilot to create these roadmaps helps you move faster in the early stages of production. Some of the biggest benefits include:

- **Quick prototyping:** Test different ideas before choosing a direction  
- **Team alignment:** Visual structure helps writers, designers, and animators stay on the same page  
- **Creative discovery:** AI often suggests story ideas or styles that you may not have thought of
