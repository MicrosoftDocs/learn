Prompt engineering is essential for working with reasoning engines. Here's how to make your experience more effective:

- **Be specific**: Clearly state your needs.
- **Use examples**: Guide the model by providing examples.
- **Set the context**: Offer enough background and instructions for clarity.
- **Iterate and refine**: Adjust prompts based on responses for improvement.
- **Limit the scope**: Break down tasks to enhance output quality.
- **Test approaches**: Experiment with different phrasings to find what works best.

With these best practices for prompting in your toolkit, the next unit dives into the importance of critical thinking in this process.
