The impact of AI is evident in multiple aspects of the upskilling journey, with its continuous growth propelling learning towards greater adaptability, accessibility, and personalization. 
 
 As an example, AI-powered software can analyze a learner’s strengths and areas for improvement, while generating exercises that align with each learner’s specific skill level. For example, a learner excelling in a topic can be given more advanced challenges, while a learner struggling can receive additional and targeted practice. This allows learners to progress at their own pace, building a solid foundation in the subject and boosting their confidence.
