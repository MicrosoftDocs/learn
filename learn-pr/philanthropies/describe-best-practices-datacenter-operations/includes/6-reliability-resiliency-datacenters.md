Reliability and resiliency are critical to datacenter operations, as they ensure consistent and uninterrupted delivery of services.

**Reliability:** Reliability refers to the ability of the datacenter to consistently perform its functions without failure. It focuses on ensuring that all systems operate correctly and deliver the expected outcomes over time.

**Example** metrics or strategies: 

- Uptime percentage: Often measured using the “five nines” standard (99.999% availability), equating to less than 5.26 minutes of downtime annually. 
- Mean time between failures (MTBF): Average time a system operates before failing. 
- Mean time to repair (MTTR): Average time required to fix a failure and restore services.

**Resiliency**: Resiliency refers to the ability of the datacenter to continue functioning during and after a failure, disruption, or disaster. It ensures rapid recovery and minimizes the impact on operations.

**Example** metrics or strategies:

- Redundancy in power, cooling, and network systems. 
- Disaster recovery and backup systems. 
- Fault-tolerant infrastructure.

## Key concepts of reliability and resiliency in datacenters

It's important to understand some of the key concepts for reliability and resiliency in datacenters.

| Concept                                                             | Examples                                                     |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Redundancy**: Redundancy involves duplicating critical systems or components to eliminate single points of failure. | • Redundant power supplies, such as backup generators and dual power grids. <br />• Multipath network connections for uninterrupted connectivity. <br />• Cooling system backups to maintain optimal temperatures. |
| **Fault tolerance**: Fault tolerance ensures that a system can continue operating even if a specific component fails. | • RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks) for data storage. <br />• Load balancing across multiple servers to avoid overloading. |
| **Disaster recovery (DR):** Disaster recovery involves strategies to restore services quickly after a significant disruption. | • Offsite backups for data recovery: Ensuring that data is backed up in a separate location to prevent loss in case of a disaster. <br />• Warm or cold datacenter sites that can take over operations during disasters: Warm datacenter sites are partially equipped with hardware (e.g., servers, networking equipment), and are not fully operational but can be activated quickly during a disaster. Cold datacenter sites are essentially empty facilities with power and cooling infrastructure but no IT equipment. They require procurement and installation of all necessary hardware, software, and data backups during a disaster. If the primary datacenter were to fail, both warm and cold sites serve as backup locations for critical operations, which helps to minimize downtime and ensure continuity of datacenter operations. |
| **High availability (HA):** High availability ensures systems are accessible and operational at all times, often achieved through clustering and redundancy. | • Active-active server configurations. <br />• Failover mechanisms for critical applications. |
| **Environmental controls**: Maintaining optimal conditions to prevent failures cause by temperature, humidity, or water damage. | • HVAC (Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning) systems <br />• Power backup and Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) <br />• Water leak detection systems |
