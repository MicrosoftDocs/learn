Datacenter monitoring is a critical aspect of datacenter operations. It ensures that all systems and infrastructure components are functioning optimally. Monitoring involves continuous tracking of factors such as environmental conditions, equipment performance, security, and overall system health. 

By using advanced monitoring tools and technologies, datacenters can:

- detect potential issues before they cause damage
- maintain uptime
- prevent failures
- optimize resource utilization. 

Proper datacenter monitoring helps ensure that servers, storage devices, cooling systems, power units, and networks operate within safe and efficient parameters, making it an essential practice for maintaining reliable and high-performance datacenter operations.

## Who is responsible for datacenter monitoring?

Next let's review who is responsible for monitoring in each type of datacenter.

|Datacenter type|Responsible team|
|----|---|
|**Enterprise datacenters**|In enterprise datacenters (owned and operated by large organizations like banks, hospitals, or tech companies), the responsibility for monitoring is typically handled by in-house IT teams or specialized datacenter operations staff.</br>- *In-house IT teams:* These teams are part of the organization and handle a broad range of IT tasks, including network management, user support, software updates, and cybersecurity.</br>- *Specialized datacenter operations staff:* These are either internal teams dedicated exclusively to managing and maintaining datacenter infrastructure or external staff specifically trained for the job. They focus on servers, storage, cooling systems, and power management.|
|**Colocation datacenters**|In colocation datacenters, the datacenter provider typically handles the physical infrastructure monitoring (e.g., temperature, power, and security), while clients (e.g., tenant organizations) are responsible for monitoring their own equipment and software (e.g., servers, storage, network).|
|**Hyperscale datacenters**|In hyperscale datacenters (typically operated by large cloud providers like Amazon, Google, or Microsoft), monitoring is highly automated, with specialized teams in charge of continuous environmental monitoring and performance monitoring across massive datacenter fleets.|
|**Edge datacenters**|In edge datacenters (smaller facilities located closer to end-users, often supporting 5G or IoT applications), monitoring can be more distributed and may involve remote management tools. Local teams and automated monitoring systems are responsible for maintaining uptime and optimal performance.|
|**Managed services datacenters**|In managed services datacenters (like those run by Rackspace or IBM), the provider is responsible for both infrastructure and service level monitoring. These datacenters offer end-to-end managed services, including monitoring of hardware, software, and network.|
