**Disaster recovery (DR)** is a critical component of datacenter operations. It ensures that systems, applications, and data can be restored quickly and effectively after an unexpected disruption. DR is a structured approach to maintaining business continuity during and after events like natural disasters, hardware failures, or cyberattacks. Essentially, DR in Datacenters is a set of policies, tools, and procedures designed to quickly restore IT systems and data after a disruption or failure.

**Disaster scenarios may include:** 

- Natural disasters: Hurricanes, earthquakes, or floods damaging datacenter facilities.
- Cyberattacks: Ransomware encrypting critical data or Distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks overwhelming systems.
  - Human error: Accidental deletion of important files or misconfigurations.
  - Hardware failures: Server crashes, power outages, or cooling system breakdowns.

## Key concepts of disaster recovery

**Recovery time objective (RTO)**: The maximum acceptable time that systems can be  down after a disaster. 
- *Example*: A 4-hour RTO means systems must be operational within 4 hours of an outage.

**Recovery point objective (RPO)**: The maximum acceptable amount of data loss, measured in time. 
- *Example*: A 1-hour RPO means no more than 1 hour's worth of data can be lost.

**Disaster recovery plans (DRPs)**: A disaster recovery plan is a documented strategy detailing how to respond to various disaster scenarios.

**Backup and restore**: Backing up data and restoring it after an incident is the foundation of disaster recovery. Types of backups: *Full*, *incremental*, differential Backup locations: *On-site*, *off-site*, or *cloud-based*.

**Redundancy**: Redundant systems and infrastructure ensure availability even during failures. 
- *Example*: Dual power sources, replicated servers, and geographically distributed datacenters.

**Tiered recovery approach**: Prioritizing systems and applications based on their criticality 
- *Critical systems*: Restored first to maintain essential services.
- *Non-critical systems*: Restored later once the business is stable.
