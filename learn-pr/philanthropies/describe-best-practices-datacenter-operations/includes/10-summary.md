This module focused on the essential operations that ensure the efficiency, reliability, and security of datacenters. We covered the importance of monitoring key systems like environmental conditions, performance, and security using tools like DCIM. 

The module also discussed key performance indicators (KPIs) used to track datacenter health, maintenance practices for hardware and software, and strategies for disaster recovery and low latency operations. We learned about the role of automation and predictive monitoring in preventing downtime and ensuring reliability.
