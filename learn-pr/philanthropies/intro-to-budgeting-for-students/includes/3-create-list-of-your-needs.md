Needs are things you must have to live, like food, shelter, and basic clothing. They help you survive, stay safe, and do important things. Wants are things that are nice to have but aren't necessary, like video games, snacks, or designer or replica clothes. They're nice to have, but you could live without them if you had to.

How Can You Tell the Difference?

Do I need this to live or stay healthy? → If yes, it's a need. If no, it's a want.

Will life be hard if I don't have this? → If yes, it's a need. If no, it's a want.

Can I find a cheaper or simpler option? → If yes, then the more expensive choice is a want.

Why Does This Matter?

Understanding the difference between needs and wants helps you spend your money wisely. If you budget your money, you should pay for your needs first before spending on fun things. If money is tight, you can cut back on wants (like eating out or buying extra clothes) to save for things that really matter.

Smart money tip: If you want something, save up for it instead of spending all your money at once. That way, you can still enjoy fun things while making sure your needs are covered first! 🚀
