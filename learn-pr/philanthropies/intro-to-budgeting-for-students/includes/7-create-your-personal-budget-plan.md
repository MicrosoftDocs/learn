Ask Copilot Activities:

- **Create a Personal Budget:** 
    1. Imagine you're saving for something special, like a trip or a new video game. Open Microsoft Copilot.
    1. Prompt Copilot to create a personal budget by typing "I want to save for [insert your goal, e.g., a new video game or a trip]. I earn twenty-five dollars per week. Can you help me create a budget plan to reach my goal?"
    1. Copilot will generate a plan showing how much you should save each week and how long it will take to reach your goal.
    1. Adjust your budget if needed:
       - If you want to save faster, ask Copilot: "Can you suggest a way to save more each week?"
       - If you have other expenses, ask: "How can I balance my savings with other spending needs?"
    5. Copy the budget Copilot provided into a notebook, document, or budgeting app.

- **Explore Budgeting Tools:** 
    1. Open Microsoft Copilot on your device. 
    1. Prompt Copilot for a list of 7 budgeting apps by typing "Can you give me a list of seven apps or online tools that help people create and stick to budgets?"
    1. Review the list that Copilot provides along with the short descriptions of how they work.
    1. Choose three apps from the list that interest you the most.
    1. Search online for more details about each app or visit their official websites to see their features.
    1. Compare the Apps
        - Think about which one seems the most helpful for your budgeting needs.
        - Ask yourself: "Which app would help me track my spending and save money the best?"

Remember, budgeting isn't just about saying "no" to things—it's about making sure you have enough for what's important to you and planning for a future where you can reach your goals!
