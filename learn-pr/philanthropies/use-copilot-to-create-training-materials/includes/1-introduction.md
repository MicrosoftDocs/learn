Creating engaging materials is key to successful training sessions. The use of Microsoft Copilot in designing these materials adds an innovative dimension to this process. This AI-powered tool can assist in various steps, from identifying the topic and objectives to evaluating AI-generated content and combining text and images into a final presentation.

Imagine a trainer who's planning to create a new training program to teach Latin American Spanish to English-speaking employees. The trainer decides to use Microsoft Copilot to streamline the process. The first step involves identifying the topic and objectives of the training materials. The topic is "Intro to Latin American Spanish," and the objectives could include mastering basic vocabulary, understanding grammar rules, and developing basic conversational skills that can be used in the workplace.

The trainer then uses Microsoft Copilot to generate content. For instance, they might prompt Microsoft Copilot with "Generate a list of common Latin American Spanish phrases for communicating with employees." The trainer also uses the Image Creator in "creative mode" within Microsoft Copilot to generate images that match the lessons, such as "Create images that represent a diverse technology driven work environment."

The process doesn't end there. It's important to critically evaluate the AI-generated content, reflecting on its relevance and accuracy. Decisions are then made on the text content and images to be used, and then they're combined to craft visually appealing training materials.

This module includes activities specifically designed for trainers to leverage in their learning environment. The activities utilize the generative AI tool, Microsoft Copilot.
