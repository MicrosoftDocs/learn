Training materials can capture learners' attention, keep them interested, and help them retain information. Engaging training materials make teaching and learning fun and effective. In this activity, you design engaging training materials using Microsoft Copilot. Designing engaging training materials involves several steps, from identifying your topic and objectives to evaluating AI-generated content and combining text and images into a final presentation.

Before starting this activity, open [Microsoft Copilot](https://copilot.microsoft.com/). Once open, you're ready to start the activity.  

 Follow these steps:

1. **Identify the topic and objectives.** Start by identifying the topic and objectives of your training materials. Topics and objectives determine the type of content and images you need to create. For example, if you're developing materials on customer service, your training objectives can include teaching communication skills and conflict resolution techniques. A good objective isn't just about being specific and measurable, but it's also about being connected to a purpose or a "why". This connection gives your goal a deeper meaning and makes it more compelling. For example, if your objective is to improve customer service, the "why" could be to enhance customer satisfaction and build long-term customer relationships.

   **Example objectives:**

   - Develop a one-week, one-hour per day training module and supplemental materials on effective communication skills and conflict resolution techniques for employees. With a focus on customer satisfaction and building long-term customer relationships, which increases customer loyalty for this quarter.

   - Create a handout that teaches employees how to communicate effectively with customers and improve their relationships.

1. **Use Microsoft Copilot to generate content.** Use Microsoft Copilot to build text content for your training materials. Make sure to use the right prompting techniques. Refer to [this case study](https://unlocked.microsoft.com/ai-anthology/case-studies/) to see the potential for prompting and content generation.

1. **Edit and refine the content.** After you generate the initial training content from Microsoft Copilot, edit and refine the content to better suit your needs. You should reorganize the information, add necessary details, or remove any irrelevant information.

1. **Use Image Creator in "creative mode" within Microsoft Copilot to generate images.** To customize images for your training materials, use prompts describing the image you want to create. For example, you could type, "Create an image of learners aged 19-70 utilizing Microsoft Teams." and Microsoft Copilot constructs an image that matches the description.

1. **Evaluate AI-generated content.** As you work with AI-generated content from Microsoft Copilot, it's important to critically evaluate the content before deciding to use it. To critically evaluate the content, consider the following questions:

   - Is the content relevant to your needs?
   - Is the information accurate and upâ€“to-date?
   - Is the source of the information reliable?
   - Are there any societal biases or limitations in the content that you should be aware of?
   - Does the content align with your values and beliefs?

   Take some time to reflect on these questions and evaluate the AI-generated content. Use your critical thinking skills to make well-informed decisions about which parts of the content you want to keep and which you want to change or remove.  

1. **Combine text and images.** Once you decide the text content and images to use, combine both in Microsoft PowerPoint slides to craft visually appealing training materials. Choose a clear layout and highlight the most critical insights. For example, you could select headings to organize the information into sections and add images alongside the text to illustrate key points.

## Reflection

Reflect on your journey through this activity. Reflect on what you learned, the challenges you faced, and how you overcame them.

- **How can you further use generative AI tools to overcome the learning challenges you experienced?** Reflect on how you can use generative AI to enhance your learning.
- **Can you think of any other areas of study, work, or daily life where you can use generative AI?** Reflect on how you can use generative AI to enhance your daily activities.
- **How should generative AI be regulated to ensure responsible use?** Reflect on the importance of developing and using generative AI responsibly and the need to ensure ethical and safe regulation. Think about the necessary measures to benefit learning.
