AI systems are changing the way you work with technology, opening new possibilities and convenience. These systems can bring a dynamic element to your work, but this dynamism can sometimes lead to unpredictability. To help make your experience of AI positive and human-centered, Microsoft has established guidelines for human-AI interactions.

The guidelines provide recommendations for creating meaningful AI-infused experiences that leave you in control and that respect your values, goals, and attention. The guidelines are grouped into four categories.

- **Setting Expectations**. The first category emphasizes the importance of clarity regarding the AI system's capabilities and performance. It is essential to articulate what the system can do and how well it can perform these tasks. This level of transparency helps users understand the AI system's limitations and expected performance, setting the stage for realistic expectations and trust in the system. Providing concrete examples can further illustrate the system's practical applications and functionalities.
- **Contextual Relevance**. The second category focuses on the AI system's ability to provide timely, contextually relevant services that are socially and culturally appropriate. The system should be designed to adapt to a variety of cultural and social contexts, recognizing and respecting diversity to ensure inclusivity. Actively identifying and reducing biases in AI algorithms is also crucial to maintain fairness and equity in the system's operations.
- **Error Handling**. The third category deals with planning for scenarios when the AI system is incorrect. It is important to have robust error-handling mechanisms in place, allowing users to easily dismiss and correct inaccurate services. This empowers users to maintain control over the AI system and fosters trust, knowing they can intervene and rectify issues as needed.
- **Adaptive Learning**. The fourth category highlights the necessity for the AI system to learn and adapt over time based on user feedback. Users must be able to teach the implemented AI system through granular feedback and have global controls to customize the system's monitoring and operations. It is also important for the system to inform users about updates to its capabilities, ensuring that the AI remains a helpful and relevant tool that evolves with the users' needs.

Building on the foundation of human-AI interaction guidelines, we transition to the Microsoft Responsible AI Standard Playbook. This playbook represents a pivotal evolution in Microsoft's approach to AI, addressing the complexities and challenges that come with integrating AI into our daily routines. While the guidelines for human-AI interaction focus on the immediate interface between humans and technology, the Responsible AI Standard broadens the scope to encompass the ethical framework that governs AI development and deployment.
