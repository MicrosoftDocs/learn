## Prompt ingredients for images 

### Detailed subject

- The detailed subject is the main part of the image. It's what grabs the viewer's attention. 
- For example, consider an image of an excited brown terrier. The terrier's expression and body language convey its excitement. 

### Scene or setting

- Describe where the subject is. What's in the background? What's the setting?
- In our example, the scene is outside. The terrier is near a tree, showing it is in an open area. The ground is wet, meaning it has recently rained.

### Additional elements 

- These are the details that improve the image. They provide context and add depth. 
- The green ball is an other element. 

### Specific style 

- Think about the style you want to use. Is it realistic, impressionistic, or abstract?
- Let's choose a hyper-realistic drawing style for our terrier image. That means we aim to include lots of tiny details.

## Crafting the image description 

When describing images, try to make the reader feel like they're there. Use words to help them see and feel the scene. Whether it's a playful dog or a peaceful landscape, your words should create a clear picture in their mind.
