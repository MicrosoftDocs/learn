Making good prompts help the AI give better answers. If your prompts are clear, the AI understands what you want. Here are some tips for making great prompts.

### Goal

Start with what you want the Generative AI assistant to do. If you're clear, the AI can give you a better answer. For example, if you need to know about a topic, say exactly what you want. Instead of saying, "Tell me about AI," try saying, "**Explain the top five benefits of AI in healthcare.**"

### Source

Share where you want to look for the information. A source helps the AI give better answers. For example, if you want to use medical journals, write it out. Like, "Explain the top five benefits of AI in healthcare. **Use medical journals from 2024 and 2025.**"

### Context

Add extra information to make the answer more useful. Context helps the AI understand better and give a good answer. For example, if you're asking about AI in healthcare, you could add, "**I'm writing a paper on AI in healthcare.** Explain the top five benefits of AI in healthcare. Use medical journals from 2024 and 2025."

### Expectations

Say what kind of answer you want. This helps the AI know if you want a short answer, a long explanation, or a list. For example, you could say, "I'm writing a paper on AI in healthcare. Explain the top five benefits of AI in healthcare. Use medical journals from 2024 and 2025. **Provide a summary for each article.**"

Using these tips will help you make prompts that get good AI answers. Remember to be clear about what you want. Explain where to get the info. Add extra details. Say what kind of answer you need. This way, you can work better with AI and get the info you need.
