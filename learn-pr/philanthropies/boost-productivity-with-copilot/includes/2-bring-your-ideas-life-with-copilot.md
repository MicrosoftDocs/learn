Copilot combines the capabilities of a large language model with real-time information from the web (through the *retrieval-augmented generation* model) to help you bring your ideas to life. Whether you're starting with a new project or you need detailed assistance with planning and execution, Copilot is designed to support your creative process every step of the way.
