In this module, we explored the essential hardware and IT infrastructure that power datacenters. We learned about different types of servers and storage systems, including SAN, NAS, and object storage.

The module also covered key components of network infrastructure, such as switches, routers, and firewalls, and discussed the role of IT apparatus like racks and enclosures in optimizing datacenter performance. By the end, we gained a solid understanding of the hardware that supports data storage, processing, and networking needs.
