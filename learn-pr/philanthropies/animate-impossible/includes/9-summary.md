In this module, you explore how AI transforms animation workflows by adding cinematic depth, motion, and atmosphere—especially in 2D visual storytelling. Using tools like OpenAI’s **Sora**, you learn how to generate dynamic video sequences from simple prompts or static images while keeping creative control and preserving your artistic intent.

You see how Sora simulates lifelike motion and visual depth in AI-generated videos using camera techniques, lighting effects, and environmental animation. Through hands-on activities and visual comparisons, you experience how AI tools speed up production, enhance narrative expression, and expand creative possibilities—even without traditional animation software.

This module shows how AI functions not just as a technical tool but as a **creative accelerator**—helping you focus more on storytelling while still achieving visually compelling results.
