In this session, learners explore how AI tools can transform traditional 2D animation workflows into dynamic, fluid motion sequences and pseudo-3D experiences. They learn how **Sora**, an AI-powered animation enhancement tool, improves animation by generating in-between frames, smoothing motion, and creating depth from flat assets. Through hands-on activities, participants use Sora’s AI features to enhance raw animations, simulate 3D environments, and refine storytelling with more natural movement and cinematic depth. The session encourages learners to view AI not as a shortcut, but as a tool that elevates visual quality and narrative impact.

## Scenario

Imagine you're an independent animator creating a music video for Cuco’s tour visuals. You have a series of 2D illustrated scenes, but the director wants the animation to feel immersive—with smooth motion, cinematic transitions, and a sense of depth. You open **Sora** and use frame interpolation to make the movement more lifelike. Then, you simulate 3D depth by layering and animating elements in a pseudo-3D space. With these AI-driven tools, you deliver a polished, cinematic video—without needing a full 3D animation studio.

## What will we be doing?

We explore how AI enhances traditional animation and apply **Sora** to improve motion, realism, and depth:

- **Introduce:** What is Sora and how does it support animation enhancement?  
- **Smooth:** How does AI frame interpolation improve animation flow?  
- **Enhance:** How does Sora upgrade 2D animations to look more cinematic?  
- **Convert:** How can Sora simulate depth and camera movement from flat frames?  
- **Create:** How do we refine animations using AI lighting, perspective, and timing tools?  
- **Apply:** How do we use these tools in hands-on activities to improve real animation sequences?

## What is the main goal?

By the end of this session, learners understand how to use AI tools like **Sora** to improve motion, add depth, and boost the storytelling quality of their animations. They gain hands-on experience smoothing scenes, simulating 3D movement, and applying enhancements that bring professional polish to 2D projects.
