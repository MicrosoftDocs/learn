In this session, learners explore how AI improves image and video creation for music video production. They get hands-on experience with Microsoft Copilot, Clipchamp, and Designer, using these tools to generate, refine, and enhance visual content. The session starts with an overview of AI's role in media production, followed by demos of Copilot's content creation features, Clipchamp's AI-powered video editing tools, and Designer's ability to create strong, eye-catching designs.

After that, learners use these tools in a hands-on activity where they turn their storyboards from Session 1 into actual visual media. They generate detailed scene images, create simple motion elements, and build a short teaser video using Clipchamp's AI features. By combining these tools, they see how AI boosts creativity and makes the production process smoother—helping them bring their music video ideas to life with high-quality visuals.

## Scenario

Now that the artist approves the concept and storyboard, it's time to bring the vision to life. To create a strong visual teaser, you use Microsoft Designer to generate enhanced images for key scenes—fine-tuning lighting, composition, and cinematic style. Next, you use Copilot to come up with creative transition ideas that help your shots flow smoothly, giving the teaser a polished, professional feel.

With your AI-generated visuals and transitions ready, you open Clipchamp to build a 15–30 second teaser for the music video. You import your updated images, apply Copilot's suggested transitions, and use Clipchamp's AI editing tools to sync the visuals with the beat of the song. To make the teaser stand out, you try AI-generated effects that give your signature shot extra visual impact.

When you show the teaser to the artist, they're excited to see their idea coming together so clearly and quickly. The AI-powered process saves time and gives you more room to explore creative options. With a strong starting point, you and the artist head into full production feeling confident in the style and direction of the final video.

## What will we be doing?

We explore how AI helps with image and video creation in music video production and use Microsoft tools to create and refine visual content:

- **Explore:** How is AI changing the way we create images and videos in media?
- **Generate:** How does Microsoft Copilot help with visual content creation?
- **Enhance:** How do Clipchamp's AI tools improve editing and timing?
- **Design:** How does Microsoft Designer help create bold and consistent visuals?
- **Integrate:** How do we bring all three tools together into one cohesive style?
- **Apply:** How do we use these tools in a hands-on activity to bring our video ideas to life?

## What is the main goal?

The goal of this session is to help learners use AI tools to create, improve, and finalize visual content for music video production. By using Microsoft Copilot, Clipchamp, and Designer, participants learn how to generate high-quality images, edit videos more efficiently, and design visuals that support their story. Through hands-on work, they turn their storyboards into polished, professional media ready for production.
