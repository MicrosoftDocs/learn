Artificial intelligence is changing how we create media. From automating time-consuming tasks to opening up new creative options, AI tools are making image and video production faster, easier, and more creative. In the past, making high-quality content took a lot of manual work, technical skill, and expensive software. Today, AI helps more people create great visuals with fewer barriers.

One of the biggest benefits of AI in media production is efficiency. AI-powered tools can handle tasks like background removal, color correction, and scene layout automatically. They also boost creativity by giving smart suggestions, generating unique visuals, and helping with idea development. Just as importantly, AI makes high-quality production more accessible—so that smaller teams and independent creators can make professional content without needing advanced training or big budgets.

As AI continues to grow, it's becoming more important for creators to understand and use these tools. In this session, we look at three key AI tools—**Microsoft Copilot**, **Clipchamp**, and **Designer**—and how they help improve the creative process in music video production.

## Introduction to AI tools: Microsoft Copilot, Clipchamp, and Designer

To get the most out of AI in media production, we focus on three helpful tools that make creating visuals and videos simpler and more powerful.

### Microsoft Copilot: content generation and creative help

Microsoft Copilot is an AI assistant that helps generate ideas, shape content, and support creative thinking. In media production, Copilot helps with:

- **Helping with storyboarding** – It helps write scene descriptions, outline ideas, and suggest creative options.  
- **Recommending edits** – Copilot reviews your content and suggests improvements to keep everything clear and consistent.

Copilot makes it easier to brainstorm, plan, and test out different versions—making it a powerful tool for early stages of video production.

Designer is great for building visuals that match your music video's mood, whether you're designing scenes, posters, or titles.

## The future of AI in media production

AI is reshaping how media is made. It speeds up workflows, makes editing easier, and gives creators more ways to tell stories. Tools like Copilot, Clipchamp, and Designer help you make high-quality visuals, edit with ease, and focus on creativity instead of technical work.
