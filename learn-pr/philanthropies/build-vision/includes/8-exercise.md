**Objective** 

Turn your music video concept and storyboard from Module 1 into a short visual teaser using **Microsoft Copilot**, **Microsoft Designer**, and **Clipchamp**.

**Materials Needed** 

- Laptop or desktop with internet access

## Step-by-Step instructions

### Part 1: Review and choose key scenes

1. Open your storyboard and concept notes from Session 1  
1. Pick **3–4 important scenes** that would look strong as visuals  
1. Choose **one “signature shot"**—a key moment that defines your video  

### Part 2: Create scene images in Microsoft Designer

1. Open **Microsoft Designer**  
1. For each scene, use a prompt like:  
   *"Create a cinematic image for a music video scene where [describe the scene]. The mood should be [emotion]. Use [visual style or color palette]."*

   :::image type="content" source="../media/module-2-exercise-figure-1.png" alt-text="Screenshot of prompt." lightbox="../media/module-2-exercise-figure-1.png":::

1. Try different angles or styles for your **signature shot**  
1. Save your favorite images for later use  


### Part 3: Generate transitions and effects with Copilot

1. Open **Microsoft Copilot**  
1. Ask Copilot to describe creative transitions:
   *"Suggest video transitions for a scene moving from [Scene 1] to [Scene 2]. The song's mood is [mood]."*

1. Get visual effects ideas for your signature shot:
  *"Describe visual effects that would enhance a scene showing [signature shot]. The effects should match a [genre] song with themes of [theme]."*

1. Save Copilot's suggestions for use in your video editor  

### Part 4: Build your teaser in Clipchamp

1. Open **Clipchamp** and create a new project (16:9 aspect ratio)  

   :::image type="content" source="../media/module-2-exercise-figure-3.png" alt-text="Screenshot of how to create new project." lightbox="../media/module-2-exercise-figure-3.png":::

1. Import your saved images from Designer

1. Use Clipchamp's AI tools to:  
  1. Arrange your scenes in order  
  1. Add transitions suggested by Copilot  
  1. Insert any text from your original concept  
  1. Apply visual effects to the **signature shot**  
  1. Sync everything to your selected song  

1. Export a **15–30 second teaser** of your music video  

### Part 5: Reflect on the process

- Watch your teaser alongside your original storyboard  
- Reflect on how AI tools helped you.
