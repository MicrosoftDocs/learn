In this module, you learn how to bring your music video concept to life using a powerful set of Microsoft AI tools: **Copilot**, **Designer**, and **Clipchamp**. Building on the ideas and storyboard from Module 1, you explore how each tool plays a unique role in turning your creative vision into a polished video teaser:

- **Copilot** helps you shape your story by refining scripts, suggesting creative transitions, and offering ideas for visual effects that match your concept.  
- **Designer** helps you generate high-quality, cinematic images to visualize key scenes and highlight your signature shot.  
- **Clipchamp** helps you combine your visuals, use AI-powered editing tools, and create a teaser that syncs with your selected song.

This module shows how today's creators can use AI not just as a toolâ€”but as a creative partner. By using these tools together, you move from concept to final product faster and with more confidence, creating a video that feels both professional and personal.
