Program planning is the process of defining your program's goal, objectives, activities, and outputs. Program planning can be crucial for ensuring your program's relevance, feasibility, and effectiveness. Copilot can help you with program planning by providing you with: 

- Ideas: Copilot can generate ideas for your program's goal, objectives, activities, and outputs, based on your program's theme, sector, and audience. 
- Templates: Copilot can create and fill in program planning templates, such as logic models, theory of change, and results frameworks. 
- Feedback: Copilot can review and critique your program plan, and suggest improvements, such as clarity, coherence, and alignment. 

## Example Scenario

Let’s consider a nonprofit working to help youth gain critical digital literacy skills. Here are some sample prompts that can be used in program planning for that organization:  

```
Generate a list of innovative digital literacy activities for high school students that can be conducted 
both online and offline, considering limited access to technology in rural areas. 
```

```
Create a logic model template for a digital literacy program targeting middle school students, including 
inputs, outputs, outcomes, and impact. 
```

```
Review this program plan for our digital literacy workshop series and provide feedback on how to improve 
its clarity and alignment with our organization’s mission 
```

```
Propose strategic objectives and measurable outputs for a year-long campaign aimed at increasing digital 
literacy among underserved youth populations. 
```

```
Outline a 12-week curriculum for an after-school program focused on teaching basic coding skills to middle 
school students, including weekly topics and learning objectives. 
```

Copilot will then produce a response that meets your request, such as a goal statement, a logic model diagram, or a feedback summary. You can also ask Copilot to refine, expand, or revise its response, or to provide more details or examples.
