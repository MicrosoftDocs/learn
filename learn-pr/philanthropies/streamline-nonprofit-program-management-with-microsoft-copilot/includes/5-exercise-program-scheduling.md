In this exercise, you'll modify a prompt template to create a program schedule, and then write your own prompt for advice managing the schedule.

```
Create a Gantt chart that outlines a schedule for the [program] and assigns tasks that 
align with the [program requirements]. Include [deadlines] and task completion status. 
```

Now it's your turn. Use your imagination, ask Copilot how it can help, and then craft prompts for monitoring and communicating progress and adherence to the schedule it creates.

Schedule Management: Use Copilot to help manage your program's schedule, including your program's changes and risks.
