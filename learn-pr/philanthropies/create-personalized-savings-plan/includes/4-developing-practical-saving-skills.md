Let's practice saving! Think of a goal you'd like to achieveâ€”maybe a new gadget or a trip. Consider:

- How much do you need to save?
- How long do you have to save?
- Which strategy will help you get there?

Ask Copilot Activity: 

1. Open Microsoft Copilot.

1. Prompt Copilot to map out a savings plan using one or more strategies by typing "I want to save for [insert your goal, for example, a new phone, a bike, or a trip]. Can you help me create a savings plan using one or more budgeting strategies?"

1. Review Copilot's suggested plan.

1. Test different strategies.

   - Ask Copilot: "Can you show me a savings plan using the 50/30/20 rule?"
   - Then try: "What if I used the Pay-Yourself-First method instead?"
   - Compare how different methods affect your savings timeline.

1. Try different adjustments to see how small changes can help you reach your goal faster.

   - Ask Copilot: "What happens if I save an extra five dollars per week?"
