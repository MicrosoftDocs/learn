Here are some popular saving strategies to help you get started:

1. **Piggy Bank Method**: Collect loose change or small amounts of money regularly.
1. **Savings Account**: Use a bank account to safely store money and earn interest.
1. **Goal-Based Saving**: Decide on specific goals and set aside money just for those goals.
1. **Automatic Savings**: Automatically transfer money into savings so you don't have to think about it.

Each method has unique benefits. For example, a piggy bank is great for quick savings, while a savings account offers security and helps your money grow with interest. Goal-based saving keeps you focused, and automatic savings ensure consistency.

Reflection Activity: Explore which strategy fits your goals best. Which one would you use for short-term goals? What about long-term ones?
