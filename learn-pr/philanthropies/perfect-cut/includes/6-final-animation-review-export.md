The final review and export phase ensures your animation looks polished, plays smoothly, and is ready for sharing across platforms. In this unit, learners complete their projects by running final checks, selecting the best export settings, and reflecting on how AI-enhanced tools shape the creative process.

## Step 1: Review playback and visual quality

Before exporting your animation:

- **Watch the full animation from start to finish**  
- Check for common issues such as:  
  - Jerky transitions or off-beat timing  
  - Color inconsistencies between scenes  
  - Misaligned overlays, captions, or audio cues  

Use **Clipchamp's preview window** and test playback at different speeds to catch subtle errors.

> Ask for peer or instructor feedback—it often reveals details you might miss.

## Step 2: Optimize export settings

Choose export settings based on your publishing platform:

- **Resolution**:  
  - **1080p** – Ideal for YouTube, Vimeo, and general distribution  
  - **4K** – Best for presentations or high-resolution displays  
  - **720p** – Useful for mobile-first content or faster uploads  

- **Format**:  
  - **MP4** – Recommended for compatibility across platforms  
  - **GIF or MOV** – Use for short loops or visuals with transparency (note feature limits)

Clipchamp offers **preset export options** optimized for popular platforms and adjusts file size to balance quality with upload efficiency.

## Step 3: Reflect on the AI-enhanced workflow

Throughout the animation process, you've used AI tools to support each phase:

- **Copilot** – Helps with scriptwriting, creative planning, and generating dialogue  
- **Microsoft Designer** – Creates characters, backgrounds, and styled visual elements  
- **Clipchamp** – Offers editing tools, transitions, audio cleanup, and format presets

These tools simplify technical steps, speed up iteration, and make professional-quality animation more approachable—especially for new creators.

## The final touch

Exporting isn't just the last task—it's the moment your animation becomes shareable, viewable, and ready to make an impact. With AI tools supporting each part of your workflow, you move from idea to finished product faster, with more polish and creative confidence. This is where your animated vision becomes a complete, audience-ready experience.
