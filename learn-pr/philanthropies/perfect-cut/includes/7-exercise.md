### 5. Review and reflect

- Watch the final video and compare it with the original animation.  
- Share your clip with a peer or small group and ask for feedback.  
- Reflect on how the enhancements affect tone, mood, and storytelling impact.

## Expected outcome

Learners apply stylized enhancements to a previously created animation clip, showing how post-production effects add polish, character, and narrative depth to animated projects.
