In this module, you complete the animation journey by exploring how AI tools improve postproduction workflows. Using **Microsoft Clipchamp** as your editing hub, you bring together visuals, motion, sound, and effects to create a polished final animation.

Clipchamp supports editing with tools like **Auto Compose**, **intelligent resizing**, and **audio cleanup**—helping your animation reach a professional finish with less manual effort.

You see the impact of AI through **before-and-after comparisons**, which highlight how automation boosts clarity, consistency, and pacing.

You also integrate AI-generated assets—such as **characters and backgrounds from Microsoft Designer**, and **scripts or voiceovers from Copilot**—into a cohesive final cut, aligned to music and timing using Clipchamp’s timeline editor.

The module ends with best practices for **reviewing**, **exporting**, and **reflecting** on your animation project, ensuring that your final output is optimized for your audience and platform.

This final phase shows how **AI doesn’t just help you start strong—it helps you finish strong**. By using these tools, you create a more refined, efficient, and expressive animation—ready for distribution and storytelling impact.
