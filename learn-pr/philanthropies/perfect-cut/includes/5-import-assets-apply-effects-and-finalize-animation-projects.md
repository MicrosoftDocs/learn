Learners walk through the final steps of assembling an AI-enhanced animation using **Microsoft Clipchamp** in this unit. From importing assets to applying effects and making timing adjustments, this phase brings all creative elements together into a cohesive, polished video ready for publishing.

## Step 1: Import AI-generated assets into Clipchamp

Begin by gathering all completed components:

- **AI-generated characters and backgrounds** from Microsoft Designer (powered by DALL·E)  
- **Animated sequences or motion effects** created with OpenAI's Sora  
- **Audio files** including music, narration, and sound effects  
- **Text overlays or title animations** made in Clipchamp or external design tools

In Clipchamp:

1. Start a new project  
1. Upload all assets to your media library  
1. Drag and drop your components onto the timeline to begin constructing the animation  

> **Tip:** Organize the timeline into scenes or sections to simplify editing and revisions.

## Step 2: Apply effects and overlays

Use Clipchamp's visual tools to enhance style, consistency, and impact:

- **Color correction and filters** – Match color tones across scenes with smart presets or manual controls  
- **Overlays** – Add particles, textures, or lighting to emphasize key visual moments  
- **Transitions** – Choose automatic transitions or manually insert fades, wipes, and zooms to create fluid scene changes  
- **Text and captions** – Insert stylized titles, lower-thirds, or AI-generated captions for clarity and accessibility  

> Optional: Use Clipchamp's voice enhancement features to remove background noise and improve spoken audio quality.

## Step 3: Align timing and sync elements

Timing shapes the rhythm and emotional pacing of your animation. Use Clipchamp's tools to align sound and visuals precisely:

- Use **snapping and timeline markers** to match audio with scene transitions  
- Adjust **clip speed and duration** to fine-tune pacing  
- Sync **scene changes or dialogue** with beats in the soundtrack or narration

Every frame should contribute to the story's rhythm and emotional tone.

## Bringing everything together

This final step is where your vision becomes fully realized. Clipchamp acts as the central editing workspace where you combine AI-generated visuals, audio, motion, and effects into a seamless final animation. While not every feature is AI-powered, Clipchamp's smart design streamlines production—allowing you to spend more time crafting meaning, emotion, and narrative impact.
