Productivity is important in today's changing world. Microsoft 365 Copilot can enhance your productivity, enabling more effective work and improved outcomes. Here's how: 

**Write, edit, summarize, and create content**. Copilot integrated with Microsoft Word can support trainers. Through a brief prompt, it generates initial drafts, integrating relevant information from other documents as required. It also suggests content enhancements and rephrases sections to enhance clarity. Microsoft Copilot can be used to create engaging content, craft training plans, and effectively summarize complex topics. Here are some sample prompts to experiment with:

- Generate a draft two-day training plan using information from [an existing learning material].  
- Improve the clarity of paragraphs 1-3 while maintaining a similar tone.
- Generate specific topics by processing data from existing training plans.

**Analyze and explore data**. Trainers can use Microsoft Copilot in Microsoft Excel to simplify analyzing learners' data. Questions can be posed to Microsoft Copilot in natural language, correlations received, and different hypothetical scenarios explored, creating data-driven insights without complex formulas. Here are some sample prompts to experiment with:  

- Present a breakdown of learner performance categorized by subject or training module.
- Analyze the potential impact of changing training methods on learner engagement. Show me a visual clarification comparing [Method A] vs [Method B].
- Develop a model illustrating the influence of employees’ training attendance based on the amount of employees’ sales during the next quarter.  

**Turn ideas and learning materials into stunning presentations**. Trainers have an abundance of materials available to them. With Microsoft Copilot, existing documents can be converted into engaging slideshows that include speaker notes and references. It can also animate and decorate presentations, allowing more time to focus on presenting the content to learners. Here are some sample prompts to experiment with:  

- Craft a presentation spanning five slides and, drawing from this research document, incorporate relevant stock images.
- Condense this presentation into speaker notes.  
- Create a concise and visually appealing slideshow that effectively conveys these points.
- Rearrange the slides to ensure a well-organized flow of information.

**Save time when writing emails**. Organizing emails can be overwhelming and time-consuming. Communication can be improved with generative AI tools like Microsoft Copilot in Outlook. Microsoft Copilot can condense email threads and write email content while maintaining a professional tone. Here are some sample prompts to experiment with:

- Provide an overview of the emails I didn't catch up on during my absence last week. Highlight any significant items.
- Draft a response to last week’s learner inquiries and add further details regarding their second and third points.  

**Create, capture, organize, and recall information**. As a note-taking partner, Microsoft Copilot in Microsoft OneNote generates plans and ideas, creates lists, organizes information, and more. It also can transform existing text by summarizing, rewriting, formatting, and adding visual context. For example, to prepare a training session on effective communication, Microsoft Copilot can be used to draft a plan and organize the sessions. Here are some sample prompts to experiment with:

- Create talking points for a training session on effective communication.
- Generate a list of icebreaker activities for a team-building training session.
- Create a checklist of items to prepare for a virtual training session.

**Organize and conduct online training sessions**. For trainers, Microsoft Copilot in Microsoft Teams can be a valuable tool for organizing and conducting training sessions. For example, trainers can use Microsoft Copilot to generate ideas for training activities, create to-do lists for session preparation, and summarize key takeaways from training sessions. Here are some sample prompts to experiment with:

- Create a summary of the feedback from my last training session.
- Draft an email to send to participants with the key takeaways from the training session.
