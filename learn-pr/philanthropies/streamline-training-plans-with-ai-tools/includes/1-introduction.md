Creating training plans and content can be a challenging and time-consuming task, but with AI tools it can be done easier and faster. AI tools can help with various aspects of content creation, such as helping write learning objectives, research topics, create assessments, and provide feedback.

Consider a trainer tasked with developing a training program on soft skills. They could use AI tools to help aid in understanding the learners' needs and suggest relevant keywords, concepts, and skills to create learning objectives, and help determine assessments that encourage critical thinking. The trainer then can use AI tools to create online quizzes and surveys for instant grading and feedback. In addition, the trainer can use these tools to increase engagement, facilitate effective communication, and improve collaboration during the training session.  

AI tools, such as Microsoft Copilot, can help you streamline your training plans and create better content. In this module, you learn how to use AI tools to write learning objectives, create assessments, provide feedback, improve writing quality, adapt to remote learning, and measure learner progress. This module teaches you how to use AI tools to create a more effective and personalized learning experience.
