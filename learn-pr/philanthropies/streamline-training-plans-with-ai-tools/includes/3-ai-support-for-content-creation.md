AI tools can generate ideas that complement trainers' expertise, offering suggestions and recommendations aligned with training goals and creating personalized learning materials. When using AI tools to create training content, full authority is retained over the materials while using AI to create impactful and personalized learning experiences. 

Here are some ways that AI can support creating educational content:

- **Developing materials**. Learners retain information best when engaged with the material. With AI-powered tools like Microsoft Copilot in Microsoft PowerPoint, interactive content can be created quickly by pulling content from other written documents. Pictures and animation can be added using a simple prompt, easily making visually engaging content while ensuring its relevance.

- **Building multimedia content**. Learning is more fun with pictures, videos, and interactive resources, but finding relevant media can be challenging and time-consuming. Tools like Microsoft Image Creator or Microsoft Designer can be used to create brand new images using prompts.

- **Crafting thought-provoking questions**. A good question can stimulate critical thinking in learners and inspire meaningful discussion. With tools like Microsoft Copilot, AI can be applied to formulate thought-provoking questions. These questions can help learners analyze, synthesize, and apply their knowledge, fostering a deeper understanding of the subject.

- **Creating learning aids**. One way to ensure that learners acquire new knowledge is to quiz them on taught concepts. Generative AI can be used to generate multiple-choice questions, flashcards, vocabulary definitions, and text summaries.
