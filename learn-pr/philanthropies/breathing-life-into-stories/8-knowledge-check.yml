### General guidance (https://review.docs.microsoft.com/learn-docs/docs/id-guidance-knowledge-check)
###  - Questions are complete sentences ending with a question mark
###  - No true/false questions
###  - 3 answers per question
###  - All answers about the same length
###  - Numeric answers listed in sorted order
###  - No "All of the above" and/or "None of the above" as answer choices
###  - No "Not" or "Except" in questions
###  - No second person ("you") in the questions or answers
###  - Provide a meaningful explanation for both correct and incorrect answers
###
### Question content requirements:
###  - Write 5 questions
###  - Questions 1,2 must test this Learning Objective: "Describe how (attributes) of (product) work to (solve problem)"
###      Guidance: These two questions can be short, no need for a long scenario to analyze. Test if they understand how the product works.
###      Example: "What differentiates an action from a control action in a Logic App?"
###  - Questions 3,4,5 must test this Learning Objective: "Evaluate whether (product) is appropriate to (general product use case)"
###      Guidance: Use scenario questions that ask the learner to analyze a situation with the "when to use" criteria presented in the module.
###      Example: "A financial company is building a system to let brokers trade financial instruments. The system must monitor market conditions, detect changes, and execute trades. It will need to handle a large volume of transactions quickly. The faster it completes trades, the more of an advantage the company will have over its competitors. Which requirement of this system would be difficult for Azure Logic Apps to satisfy?"

quiz:
    questions:
    - content: "What is one of the main advantages of using AI in interactive storytelling?"
      choices:
      - content: "It accelerates the creation of characters and dialogue while enhancing creativity"
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "AI tools like Azure OpenAI and DALL·E help streamline content creation and inspire new narrative directions."
      - content: "It automatically generates 3D environments and level design"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "AI tools in this module focus on character and dialogue—not full 3D environment design."
      - content: "It replaces the need for a human writer or narrative structure"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "AI supports the creative process but doesn't replace human storytelling or structure."

    - content: "How does DALL·E contribute to interactive storytelling?"
      choices:
      - content: "By generating character portraits from text descriptions"
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "DALL·E turns detailed prompts into visual images, making it easier to conceptualize and present story characters."
      - content: "By creating branching story logic for interactive games"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Branching logic and dialogue are handled by language models like GPT, not DALL·E."
      - content: "By animating cutscenes based on story beats"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "DALL·E generates static visuals—it doesn't handle animation or video production."

    - content: "What technique helps maintain narrative consistency when using both AI and human-generated content?"
      choices:
      - content: "Using a style guide to align tone, language, and structure across all dialogue"
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "A style guide ensures that AI-generated content fits seamlessly with manually written scenes."
      - content: "Randomizing AI outputs to add variety"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Randomization can lead to inconsistency and confusion—controlled prompts and review are key."
      - content: "Turning off AI memory and limiting all responses to one sentence"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Limiting responses reduces quality—context and coherence are essential for immersion."

    - content: "Why is human oversight important when refining AI-generated dialogue trees?"
      choices:
      - content: "To ensure emotional realism, logical flow, and alignment with character personality"
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "Human review helps adjust pacing, consistency, and tone to meet storytelling goals."
      - content: "To hand-draw each scene before using AI"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Hand-drawing is unrelated to refining AI dialogue—it's about visual creation."
      - content: "To convert dialogue into binary code for game engines"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Game engine integration may require formatting, but binary conversion is not part of narrative refinement."

    - content: "How does AI-powered dialogue generation support player immersion?"
      choices:
      - content: "By allowing NPCs to react dynamically to player choices and emotions"
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "AI can adjust responses based on player behavior, creating more natural, engaging interactions."
      - content: "By limiting player input to multiple-choice questions"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Limiting input can reduce immersion—AI allows more flexible, natural language interaction."
      - content: "By replacing all narrative paths with a single fixed outcome"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Branching dialogue is key to immersion—fixed outcomes reduce interactivity."
