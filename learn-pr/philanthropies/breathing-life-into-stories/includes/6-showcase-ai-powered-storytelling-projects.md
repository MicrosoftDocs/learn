After generating characters, dialogue trees, and interactive branches with AI, the final step is to polish your content and prepare it for presentation. This lesson focuses on how to review and refine your AI-generated assets to ensure narrative cohesion and emotional impact, then present them in an engaging, user-ready format.

## Review and polish all AI-generated elements

Before sharing your story, itâ€™s important to evaluate and refine each AI-generated component to ensure it aligns with the overall narrative.

### Final evaluation checklist

- **Character portraits**  
  Are visual styles consistent? Do they reflect character traits, tone, and world design?

- **Dialogue trees**  
  Do they flow logically? Do branches respond clearly to different player actions or choices?

- **Narrative consistency**  
  Do AI-generated elements match manually written scenes in tone and pacing?

- **Emotional coherence**  
  Do dialogue and imagery evoke the intended emotional response from players?

Make final adjustments to wording, structure, or visuals to enhance clarity, tone, or player impact. Even small tweaks can significantly elevate the storytelling experience.

### Key adjustments

- Rewriting awkward phrases or unnatural dialogue  
- Recoloring or modifying portraits to align with story themes  
- Re-sequencing dialogue for stronger emotional build-up  

Refinement ensures your story feels polished, cohesive, and intentional.

## Presentation techniques for interactive storytelling

Once your story is ready, the next step is showcasing it in a way that engages your audience and highlights the AI-enhanced elements.

### Best practices for showcasing AI-generated content

- **Integrate seamlessly**  
  Place portraits beside dialogue during key conversations to create emotional resonance and identity recognition.

- **Use interactive formats**  
  Present your project in tools like PowerPoint, Twine, Unity, or Microsoft Teams to simulate branching interactions.

- **Highlight key branches**  
  Show how different player choices lead to varied outcomes, demonstrating the narrative depth powered by AI.

- **Emphasize visual and emotional impact**  
  Use pacing, music, and transitions to amplify emotional beats and character moments.

A well-prepared presentation not only demonstrates technical achievement but also brings your audience into the emotional core of your story.

## Final takeaway

By carefully reviewing, refining, and presenting your AI-powered storytelling project, you transform individual assets into a seamless, immersive narrative experience. This final step highlights the balance between creative vision and AI assistance, showcasing how these tools can elevate interactive storytelling when used thoughtfully.
