In interactive storytelling, strong visuals help bring characters to life and reinforce the tone of the story world. DALL·E, integrated through Azure OpenAI, enables creators to generate custom character portraits using descriptive text prompts. This lesson guides learners through writing effective prompts, refining generated images, and aligning portraits with the narrative style of their story.

## Input Character Descriptions into DALL·E for Visual Representation

To begin generating visuals, let's write a character prompt that includes physical traits, personality cues, and thematic details.

### Writing Effective Prompts

- **Start with Core Details**  
  Include gender, age, attire, and mood.  
  *Example*:  
  "A young woman with curly auburn hair, wearing a tattered cloak, standing in a misty forest, looking determined."

- **Add Tone and Genre**  
  Include descriptors that define the visual style.  
  *Example*:  
  "In a dark fantasy art style” or “illustrated like a hand-painted storybook."

- **Use Specific Adjectives**  
  Replace vague terms with detailed ones.  
  Instead of "pretty," say "sharp cheekbones, confident smile, and vibrant green eyes."

The more specific your prompt, the more relevant and story-aligned your result.

## How Style, Theme, and Detail Affect the Image

The tone and theme of your prompt directly influence the result. Small changes can significantly shift the visual outcome.

### Style Examples

- "in the style of anime" vs. "in a medieval oil painting style"
- "cyberpunk-inspired with neon lighting" vs. "storybook-style, soft pastel colors"

Experimenting with tone, lighting, and visual references allows you to match the image to your world.

## Generating and Reviewing Portraits in DALL·E

Once your prompt is crafted:

1. Open DALL·E through Azure OpenAI Studio or Microsoft Designer.
2. Enter your prompt and generate several variations.
3. Review each image, focusing on alignment with your character’s role, mood, and world.

Don’t expect perfection on the first try—DALL·E is a creative collaborator. Slight prompt adjustments can dramatically improve outcomes.

## Refining AI-Generated Images to Match the Story Aesthetic

To ensure consistency across your cast of characters or narrative setting, you may need to revise or enhance AI-generated portraits.

### Techniques for Refinement

- **Color Adjustment**  
  Use tools like Designer or external editors (for example, Clipchamp, Paint 3D) to align the color palette across all characters.

- **Pose Consistency**  
  Regenerate with specific pose instructions (for example, "standing with arms crossed" or "sitting on a throne").

- **Feature Matching**  
  If needed, regenerate portraits with matching visual traits (for example, family resemblance, shared armor design, house insignias).

### Enhancing with Additional Tools

- Use image editors to add shadows, background consistency, or visual effects.
- Add frames, labels, or expressions that support game mechanics (for example, emotion-based dialogue triggers).

These refinements help ensure that your characters not only look unique—but belong together in the same world.
