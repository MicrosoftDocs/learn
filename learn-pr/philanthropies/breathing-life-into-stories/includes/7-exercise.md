**Objective:**  

Design a short interactive storytelling sequence that features AI-generated character portraits and dynamic dialogue using Microsoft Designer and Azure OpenAI Studio. This activity guides learners through the process of bringing a character to life visually and narratively, then connecting dialogue branches to interactive story choices.

**Materials Needed:**  
- Laptop or desktop with internet access  
- Microsoft Designer access (for character portrait generation)  
- Azure OpenAI Studio access (for dialogue generation and testing)  
- Microsoft PowerPoint or Microsoft Sway (for building an interactive story presentation)

### Part 1: Generate a Character Portrait with Microsoft Designer

1. **Develop a Character Concept**  
   - Write a short description of a fictional character (1–2 sentences). Include traits like age, appearance, mood, and setting.  
     Example: *"A weary knight in her 40s with a scar over one eye, wearing silver armor and standing at a cliff’s edge under a stormy sky."*

2. **Open Microsoft Designer**  
   - Input your character description as a prompt.  
   - Refine the prompt by adding style direction (for example, "in storybook illustration style" or "concept art style").  
   - Choose your favorite portrait from the generated options.

3. **Download or Save the Image**  
   - Keep the portrait ready for integration into your story demo.

### Part 2: Build a Branching Dialogue with Azure OpenAI Studio

1. **Open Azure OpenAI Studio (Chat Playground)**  
   - Set your system message to define the character’s role and tone.  
     Example: *"You're a noble knight speaking with humility and wisdom, responding to a traveler who seeks your advice."*

2. **Generate Dialogue Responses**  
   - Provide user inputs that reflect branching paths (for example, "Why did you become a knight?" or "Will you help me on my quest?")  
   - Use the model to generate different responses based on emotion, player alignment, or prior choices.

3. **Create a Simple Dialogue Tree**  
   - Organize your prompt/response pairs into a visual or written format with 2–3 branches.

### Part 3: Present an Interactive Demo with Microsoft PowerPoint or Sway

1. **Create a Visual Slide or Story Flow**  
   - Insert your character portrait into a slide or Sway card.  
   - Display the dialogue tree as clickable buttons or linked text options.

2. **Add Narrative Context**  
   - Introduce the scene with 1–2 background slides/cards describing the setting and scenario.

3. **Enable Interaction**  
   - Link each choice to a slide or card showing the corresponding AI-generated response.  
   - Encourage viewers to explore different paths.

**Expected Outcome:**  
Learners produce a short, interactive storytelling prototype that features an AI-generated character portrait and dialogue branches. This activity demonstrates how Microsoft tools can support world-building, character development, and non-linear narrative design in a seamless creative workflow.
