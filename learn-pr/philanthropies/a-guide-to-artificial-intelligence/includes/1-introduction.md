AI, or artificial intelligence, is the ability of a computer system to learn from past data and errors, enabling it to make increasingly accurate predictions for future behavior. This encompasses a broad range of activities, such as problem-solving, speech recognition, learning, and decision-making.

Data, models, algorithms, and neural networks are building blocks of AI. AI utilizes data for learning and reasoning, models and algorithms for knowledge representation and processing, and neural networks for learning from large datasets and accomplishing complex tasks.

AI has numerous real-world applications. For example, in healthcare, it can be used for diagnosing diseases, detecting tumors, and developing patient treatment plans.

This module explains the fundamental principles of AI, machines learning, and neural networks and their interrelationships. It also explores the changes and opportunities that AI brings to society and the future.
