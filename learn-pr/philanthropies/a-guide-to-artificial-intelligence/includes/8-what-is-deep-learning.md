Deep learning is a type of machine learning that uses neural networks. Using deep learning, the neural networks can make decisions based on unstructured and/ or unlabeled data.6 Much like the neurons in your brain, neural networks consist of interconnected units that collaborate to learn from data and produce informed predictions to solve complex problems.<sup>7</sup>

Whenever you read a report, drive a car, or smell a flower, billions of neurons in your brain process the information through tiny electric signals. Each neuron processes inputs, and the results are output to the next neuron for subsequent processing.<sup>6</sup> Almost instantly, the neurons' output produces a business insight, a foot on the brake, or the feeling of joy.

In much the same way, neural networks allow digital systems to interpret and respond to situations. Neural networks can process large volumes of data to solve complex problems.<sup>6</sup> For example, in the field of education, a neural network can analyze students' historical performance, learning styles, and preferences to recommend personalized learning paths, effectively addressing individual needs in a diverse classroom setting.
