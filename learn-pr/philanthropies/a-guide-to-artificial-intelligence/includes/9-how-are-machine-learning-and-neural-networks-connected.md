Although neural networks are considered a subset of machine learning model, some significant differences exist between neural networks and other machine learning models.

Neural networks are generally more complex and capable of operating independently than regular machine learning models.<sup>6</sup> For example, a neural network can determine whether its predictions and outcomes are accurate.

Additionally, neural networks are structured so that they can continue to learn and make predictions without directions. Machine learning models, on the other hand, are limited to what the model has specifically been trained on.<sup>6</sup>
