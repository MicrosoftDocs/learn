Machine learning is a subfield of AI. Advanced computer systems use machine learning to develop their ability to analyze data and perform tasks autonomously.<sup>5</sup> Here's how AI and machine learning collaborate:

Step 1: An AI system is built using machine learning and other techniques.<br>
Step 2: Machine learning models are created by analyzing patterns in data.<br> 
Step 3: The machine learning models are optimized based on observed data patterns.<br> 
Step 4: The process repeats and refines until the models achieve a high level of accuracy suitable for the specific tasks they're intended to perform.
