Machine learning has a wide range of potential uses in various industries, such as manufacturing, financial services, healthcare, retail, and government services.<sup>3</sup> Let's explore how machine learning can work in the context of healthcare.

Hospitals are continuously trying to improve patients' recovery time and decrease readmissions. Hospitals' ability to find patterns and trends in patients' medical histories, treatments, lab results, and lifestyles can help healthcare professionals provide better treatments and reduce readmissions.<sup>4</sup>

Hospitals and healthcare professionals can leverage a machine learning model to analyze patients' data. Through training on historical records, the model can use past patients' outcomes to recognize predictive indicators and factors.<sup>4</sup>  

With the machine learning model in place, healthcare professionals can input new patient data to predict readmission likelihood. Machine learning can empower healthcare professionals to adopt proactive measures and tailor treatments for individual patients, leading to successful recoveries and fewer readmissions.<sup>4</sup>

As hospitals accumulate data over time, the machine learning model continuously refines its ability to identify risk factors and recommend personalized interventions to improve patient outcomes. Using machine learning technology, healthcare professionals can make data-driven decisions, enhance patients' care, and ultimately save more lives.<sup>4</sup>
