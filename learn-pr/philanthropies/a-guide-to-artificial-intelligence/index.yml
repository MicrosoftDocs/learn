summary: This module explores fundamental concepts in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning.

abstract: |
  By the end of this module, you'll be able to:
  - Distinguish between supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning, and identify the type of machine learning most suitable for certain scenarios. 
  - Assess the effectiveness of neural networks in handling unstructured and unlabeled data compared to other machine learning techniques. 
  - Evaluate statements on the role of continuous refinement in machine learning models.
