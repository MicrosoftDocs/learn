Trainers can polish training methods by implementing AI-powered tools, leading to a more engaging, stimulating, and conducive learning environment. AI integration can increase knowledge retention rates, engagement levels, and creative openness, ultimately benefiting learners.

Trainers can utilize generative AI-powered image generators in their training preparation and delivery. For example, Microsoft Designer is a web-based graphic design tool that uses AI technology to formulate imagery, templates, and designs. Microsoft Designer provides writing assistance, layout suggestions, and video captions. All the generated content is customizable and downloadable, enabling trainers to use personalized and engaging visuals in lessons.

Another generative AI image generator tool that trainers can use is the Image Creator by Microsoft Designer, previously known as Bing Image Creator. This tool creates images from text prompts. You can access this tool by visiting [https://www.bing.com/images/create](https://www.bing.com/images/create) or by going to [bing.com/chat](https://www.bing.com/chat) and writing a text-to-image prompt in Microsoft Copilot's 'creative mode.' In this video, you will explore how to utilize Microsoft's Image Creator.
