Generative AI tools enable trainers to create engaging lessons and resources, design interactive activities and assessments, and seamlessly manage administrative tasks. Here are some ways advanced AI-powered image tools can enhance training delivery even further:

- **Brainstorming and idea generation**. AI-generated images can be creative prompts for brainstorming sessions, ideation, or problem-solving activities. Using AI-generated images as prompts, one can expose themselves to unusual or unexpected visual stimuli to encourage out-of-the-box thinking, then can challenge oneâ€™s assumptions and spark new ideas. AI-powered images can spark imagination by giving suggestions for products, storytelling, developing resources, or even creating logos.
- **Concept visualization and comprehension**. AI-generated images bring abstract concepts to life. Generated images solidify ideas to be more accessible and engaging for learners, especially when covering historical events, scientific phenomena, or mathematical concepts.
- **Visual communication**. Image-generating tools can help trainers showcase data or phenomena to learners through visual communication, making it easier for them to assimilate and comprehend the information. Visual communication is the use of images, symbols, colors, charts, graphs, and diagrams to convey information or ideas. Visual communication can help simplify complex concepts and increase information recall, especially in visual learners.
- **Visual storytelling effect**. Trainers can use image-generating tools to draw illustrations, storyboards, or comics that complement written narratives. Image generation enables trainers to visualize and share complex concepts with their learners.
- **Enrichment of learning materials**. AI-generated images can enrich training materials such as presentations, assignments, and lessons. Trainers can customize images to make content more visually appealing, engaging, and effective for learners.
- **Improvement in art and design projects**. AI-powered image generators can be incorporated into art and design lessons, allowing learners to experiment with different styles, techniques, and media. The blending of AI and art accommodates creativity, innovation, and collaboration.

Trainers can use generative AI-powered image tools to generate images based on text descriptions or styles, and use the images to stimulate brainstorming, comprehension, engagement, and innovation among learners.
