AI-generated images can help increase creativity and collaboration in a training session. They serve as a supplemental tool for brainstorming, concept visualization, communication, storytelling, and enrichment.

Imagine a scenario where a trainer is teaching a course on digital art. The trainer wants to introduce learners to the concept of generative AI tools and how they can be used in their educational pursuits.  Instead of just explaining the concept verbally, the trainer uses an AI-powered image generator to create a series of images based on different text descriptions. These images serve as visual aids, helping the students understand how AI can generate diverse and creative visuals from simple text prompts.

The trainer then assigns a project where the learners must use an AI-powered image generator to create their own images based on specific themes or concepts. This hands-on experience allows learners to explore the capabilities of generative AI tools and understand their potential applications. The learners are not only able to grasp the concept better but also get to experiment with a new tool that can aid their creativity and innovation.

In this module, you’ll learn how to effectively use AI image generators to foster a more creative and collaborative training environment for your learners, all while passing on what you’ve learned to them.
