  questions: 
    - content: "What's the role of AI-generated images in training programs?"
      choices:
        - content: "They restrict trainers to experiment with different styles and techniques due to their limitations."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. AI-generated images allow trainers to experiment with many different styles and techniques."
        - content: "They discourage collaboration as it is an independent activity."
          isCorrect: false

        - content: "They can be incorporated into brainstorming sessions."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct.  AI-generated images can be incorporated into art and design lessons."
    - content: "What's the impact of the quality of the prompt on the AI-generated image?"
      choices:
        - content: "The quality of the prompt determines the style of the AI-generated image."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. The prompt helps determine style but does not necessarily impact overall quality."
        - content: "The quality of the prompt determines the quality of the AI-generated image."

          explanation: "Incorrect. The quality of the prompt does not affect the speed of generating the AI image."
    - content: "What's the recommended action when an AI-generated image doesn't align with your expectations?"
