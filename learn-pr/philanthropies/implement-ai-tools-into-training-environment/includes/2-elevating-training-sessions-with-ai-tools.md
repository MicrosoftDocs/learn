Now that you have seen how workplaces are changing due to AI, let's explore how it can help learner engagement.

## Cognitive Engagement with AI Tools

Generative AI can enhance creativity, productivity, and skills. Integrating AI into workflows frees up time to promote learner engagement. Learners' cognitive engagement decreases during passive activities but increases during interactive activities. Deeper cognitive engagement leads to higher level learning outcomes. The table below lists learning types, their definitions, and examples of learner activities that correspond to those learning types.

| Learning type | Definition | Examples |
| - | - | - |
| Passive | Learners absorb information from learning content without immediate interaction | - Watching a video<br />- Reading an article |
| Active | Learners take proactive steps to interact with learning content | - Highlighting and underlining while reading<br />- Paraphrasing while writing |
| Constructive | Learners generate their own content and foster intellectual development from learning materials | - Self-explaining concepts<br />- Drawing concept maps<br />- Answering a problem-solving question |
| Interactive | Learners engage in active dialogue and mutually contribute to constructive learning outcomes | -Debating justification for a given answer |

AI-powered tools can also enhance learner engagement by providing immersive and hands-on learning experiences. AI tools can bring abstract concepts to life, encouraging active participation and promoting deeper understanding. Furthermore, AI-powered educational games and quizzes can make learning more fun and interactive, increasing learner enthusiasm and participation. Examples of AI-powered tools include Reading Coach, Search Coach, and Speaker Coach by Microsoft.

- Reading Coach is a tool designed to support personalized training approaches. It offers interactive activities and exercises to improve learners' reading skills in an engaging way. Reading Coach allows the creation of targeted practice exercises specific to learners' struggles, enabling the teaching of pronunciation and fluency through fun activities.
- Search Coach is a tool designed to provide relevant information to improve online searches. With Search Coach, learners can navigate online resources confidently and discern credible sources from unreliable ones.
- Speaker Coach is a tool designed to support learners in improving their presentation abilities. It offers learners opportunities to practice their presentation and receive feedback on their performance, highlighting both their strengths and areas for improvement. This helps learners make their presentations clearer and avoid talking too much or just reading from slides.
