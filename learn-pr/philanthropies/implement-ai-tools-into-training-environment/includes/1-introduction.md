This module explores generative AI's capabilities. You will delve into the diverse applications of generative AI tools in education.

AI has emerged as a game changer offering innovative and interactive tools that are reshaping the training landscape. This module is an introductory guide to the benefits of integrating the latest AI tools into your training environment, highlighting how they can enhance creativity, productivity, and skills. You'll discover how AI tools not only can help in streamlining operations, but also promote learning engagement, leading to deeper cognitive engagement and higher-level learning outcomes.

For example, an organization recently implemented AI into its training program. The organization uses AI-powered tools like Microsoft's Reading Coach to provide personalized language training to its beneficiaries across different countries. This tool offers interactive activities and exercises tailored to each learner's proficiency level, helping them improve their language skills in an engaging way. The organization also understands there are limitations to AI, such as data accuracy and understanding context created by an AI system, so the organization ensures that all beneficiaries are aware of these aspects. This real-life example demonstrates an organization that understands the capabilities and limitations of AI in a training environment.
