Datacenter developers and operators actively engage with local communities through partnerships and programs that support education, business growth, and local NGOs (Non-Governmental Organization is a non-profit organization that addresses various social, environmental, or community issues).

## Educational partnerships

- Datacenters require locally based, highly skilled professionals to operate and manage these facilities. Partnerships with local education and training organizations are vital to creating local pathways into direct and indirect datacenter employment. To support this objective, datacenter developers and operators have created local partnerships and projects to support existing and develop new training programs. 

- Collaboration with schools, universities, and vocational programs to support STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) education are common across datacenter developments internationally. 

- Providing the necessary resources to enhance access to skilling initiatives and support learner development is a key aspect of typical data center skilling partnerships. This support can include scholarships and equipment donations to strengthen ICT education.

## Examples

- **Google's STEM Programs in the Netherlands:** Google partnered with Dutch schools to promote STEM education through workshops, lab equipment donations, and scholarships. Their goal was to create a tech-savvy workforce that could eventually support datacenter operations locally.
- **Microsoft Datacenter Academy:** Microsoft created the Datacenter Academy, a global initiative offering training, mentorship, practical learning through Datacenter Labs, and work experience via internship and apprenticeship. Students graduate with certifications that make them highly employable in the growing industry

## Philanthropic activities

Like many local employers, DC developers and operators actively support community organizations in need through philanthropic initiatives. 

These efforts include employee volunteer programs, financial donations, community funds, corporate contributions to charities, disaster relief assistance, and local development projects. Additionally, they provide support for essential public services such as clinics, schools, and clean water initiatives.

## Examples

- **Equinix in Brazil:** Equinix launched community outreach programs in SÃ£o Paulo, supporting underprivileged youth through technology training and donating equipment to local schools.
- **Amazon in South Africa:** Amazon donated millions to rural communities near its Cape Town datacenter, supporting local clinics, clean water initiatives, and tech education.
- **Microsoft in Ireland:** Microsoft partners with Change X International to support grassroots community organizations near their datacenters. In Dublin, this collaboration has funded 66 community groups, benefiting over 4,500 people. The key goals include launching new local projects focused on environmental sustainability, creating more sustainable, livable, and inclusive communities.

## Local business support

Datacenter developments are based in local communities, with locally based workforce and support and engage with local supply chains, having a huge impact on local economies.

Sourcing for datacenters relies on both global and local supply chains and suppliers to operate, however, they will typically seek sourcing from local suppliers and contractors to stimulate small business growth. 

Datacenters serve as key technology hubs and drivers of innovation within communities. Many developers and operators collaborate with innovation hubs to support startups and entrepreneurs, helping them access and leverage the opportunities created by cloud regions and data center infrastructure.

## Examples

- **Facebook (Meta) in New Mexico, USA:** Meta sources materials for its datacenter from local suppliers, boosting small and medium enterprises. They also supported local farmers by funding irrigation projects
