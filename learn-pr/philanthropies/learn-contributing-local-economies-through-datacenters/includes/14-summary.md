This module examined the vital role datacenters play in shaping local economies and communities. We learned how datacenters contribute to job creation, enhance local services, and foster economic growth. The module also covered community engagement throughout the datacenter lifecycle, including partnerships with local organizations for education, workforce training, and corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives. By the end, we gained a deeper understanding of the transformative impact datacenters have on the regions they serve.
