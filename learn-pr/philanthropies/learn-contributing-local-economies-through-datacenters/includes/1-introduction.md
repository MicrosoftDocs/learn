Datacenters are the critical infrastructure powering the digital economy, fueling cloud computing, e-commerce, and streaming services. Beyond their technological function, they bring significant economic, social, and environmental benefits to local communities. 

They create numerous opportunities, from job creation to infrastructure improvements, and contribute positively to society. By raising awareness of these contributions, communities can better appreciate the valuable role datacenters play in enhancing their quality of life and driving sustainable development. 

Local and national governments are working to ensure these benefits reach communities by developing policies that guide how datacenter projects should be implemented. A key example of this is the 2022 Ireland Government Statement on the Role of Data Centers in Ireland's Enterprise Strategy, in which they revised the statement to address more explicitly the way in which datacenters will adhere to Ireland's energy and enterprise policy objectives
