As societies and economies become more digitized, the demand for digital infrastructure continues to rise. The growth and development of this infrastructure brings a wide range of benefits, both direct and indirect, to the communities where they operate. 

The datacenter sector represents a significant evolution of the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) and broader technology sectors. For example, the computing industry in Ireland supported more than 90,000 jobs in 2020, with these jobs growing at more than twice the rate of overall jobs growth and being amongst the best-paying jobs in Ireland. Datacenter development in Ireland and other countries reflects the growing complexity and scale of technological needs in our increasingly digital world.

**Examples include:**

- **Economic growth:**

  - Direct employment opportunities for IT specialists, engineers, and operational staff. 

  - Indirect employment in sectors like design, construction, logistics, and maintenance, particularly during construction and setup phases. 

  - Development of new “cloud regions” and cloud infrastructure leads to large opportunities for new employment both directly within the delivery and management of this infrastructure but also indirectly across the ICT and digital sectors enabling organizations to leverage the latest technologies to develop new products, solutions, tools and platforms. 

  - Datacenter construction and operations bring significant investments into local economies and create new opportunities to grow local supply chains. 

  - Datacenters are examples of the development of the ICT sector into Increased demand for goods and services benefits local businesses.

- **Job creation:**

  - Datacenters generate specialized roles that significantly contribute to the workforce, offering high-value employment opportunities that support the growing infrastructure.

  - Datacenters require highly skilled professionals such as roles in IT, engineering, and maintenance.

  - **Example**: Microsoft Datacenters in Washington

    - Current Employment: 417 employees

    - Construction Work Hours: Approximately 5.4 million work hours

    - Projected Employment by 2026: 673 full-time employees and contractors

    - Direct Employment Opportunities

      - Campus management 

      - People management 

      - Learning and development 

      - IT operations 

      - Mechanical engineers 

      - Electrical engineers 

      - Security contractors 

      - Building maintenance 

      - Critical environments 

    - Indirect Job Creation

      - Construction, logistics, and service industries

      - Secondary economic benefits surpassing lower-wage industries

    - Construction Jobs

      - Electricians 

      - Plumbers and pipefitters 

      - Carpenters 

      - Structural iron and steel workers 

      - Concrete workers 

      - Earth movers

  - Many datacenter developers will support initiatives to support pathways into these roles throughout the datacenter lifecycle for the communities they are located particularly in construction and operations.

    - **Example**: Microsoft's Datacenter Academy

      - This addresses the skilled labor gap by training local students, ensuring communities are equipped to benefit from high-value job opportunities in the datacenter industry. 

      - The aim is to create a landscape where the community has the flexibility to grow in different directions.

**Supporting development of local infrastructure:**

Datacenter facilities play a vital role in boosting local, regional, and national economies. They contribute significantly to tax revenues through various channels such as business taxes, income taxes, goods and services taxes, and infrastructure levies. This, in turn, supports the funding of public services and enhances the overall well-being of communities. 

Similar to other large industrial developments in communities, the development of datacenters often leads to local infrastructure improvements such as roads, transportation, and utilities that benefit the broader community. 

Better connectivity and internet access for residents, businesses, and schools in underserved areas.

- **Example**: AWS in Virginia, USA 

  - AWS has invested over $35 billion in Virginia datacenters since 2011. 

  - This investment makes AWS one of the state's largest tax contributors, helping fund schools, emergency services, and infrastructure improvements.

- **Example**: Microsoft Airband Initiative 

  - This initiative aims to bring broadband access to rural and underserved communities in the United States. 

  - By partnering with local internet service providers and leveraging datacenter infrastructure, the initiative has successfully expanded high speed internet access, benefiting residents, businesses, and schools.
