## Energy system optimization

Datacenters are driving positive change by addressing high energy demands through innovative solutions. Companies are investing in renewable energy sources to promote sustainable resource use, enhance overall grid capacity, and ease the strain on local grids—key steps in advancing global energy priorities and modernizing the grid. 

- **Example**: Grid modernization is a comprehensive approach to upgrading the electrical grid to make it more reliable, efficient, and capable of integrating renewable energy sources. This involves implementing advanced technologies, such as smart meters, automated feeder switches, and energy storage systems, to enhance grid performance and resilience. Microsoft has been actively involved in grid modernization efforts to support their datacenters. In Quincy, Washington, Microsoft collaborated with local utilities to upgrade the electrical grid, enhancing its capacity and reliability. This project included the installation of advanced grid technologies, such as smart meters and automated switches, to improve grid performance and resilience. 

  - Microsoft and other developers are also investing in renewable energy projects, such as wind and solar farms, to deliver renewable energy capacity to national grid networks.

## Land use optimization opportunities

Datacenters can positively impact communities by creatively addressing land use challenges. Innovative solutions, such as vertical data centers and repurposing old industrial buildings, are being implemented to avoid displacing agricultural or residential areas. These approaches not only optimize space but also contribute to sustainable development and community revitalization. 

- **Example**: Google converted an old paper mill in Finland into a datacenter, reducing the need for new land development.

## Contributing to district heat networks through waste heat recovery

Waste heat recovery in datacenters involves capturing and repurposing the excess heat generated by servers and other equipment. This process can significantly enhance energy efficiency, reduce environmental impact, and lower operational costs. However, it also presents challenges such as the need for advanced cooling technologies, high initial investment, and regulatory compliance. Despite these complexities, waste heat recovery remains a promising strategy for making datacenters more sustainable and cost-effective. 

- **Example**: Microsoft's datacenter in Høje-Taastrup, Denmark, is a prime example of waste heat recovery. The excess heat generated by the datacenter is repurposed to heat around 6,000 local homes through a partnership with the district heating organization VEKS. This initiative not only reduces carbon emissions but also provides affordable heating to the community. 

- **Example**: In Helsinki, Finland, Equinix's datacenter collaborates with the local energy company to channel waste heat into the district heating network. This project helps heat homes and businesses, contributing to the city's sustainability goals. Additionally, Equinix has supported the development of green spaces around their datacenters, enhancing community well-being and environmental quality

## Supporting community environmental infrastructure

Datacenters are large energy users that deliver on many sustainability priorities of local authorities and governments. Datacenter developers also focus on supporting community level initiative and priorities further to these regulatory requirements and infrastructure investments through environmental focus philanthropic endeavors. 

An **example** of this is the **Community Environmental Sustainability (CES) program**, a part of Microsoft's Datacenter Community Affairs Team.

- The program focuses on addressing local datacenter community needs through science-informed Nature Based Solutions, aiming to provide community well-being, social equity, and positive environmental benefits. This program is committed to key objectives such as:

  - Investing in long-term environmental health: The CES program is dedicated to protecting the environmental health of communities hosting Microsoft's priority datacenters. This involves identifying priority environmental issues, building local partnerships, and empowering sustainable solutions to protect and restore natural environments. 

  - Supporting localized nature-based projects: The program supports projects that are flexible, multi-functional, and adaptable, aiming to provide human well-being, social equity, and environmental benefits.

- The CES program partners with local non-profit organizations to facilitate environmental projects such as:

  - Urban forestry: High-impact projects that involve tree planting to address community priorities. These projects include all necessary materials, staff support for engagement events, and three years of monitoring and maintenance. 

  - Ecological restoration: Practices tailored to local conditions and community priorities to help recover ecosystems, increase biodiversity, and improve green spaces.

- These projects are orchestrated using our guiding principles to ensure alignment with our program's mission and objectives:

  - Integrate and employ diverse and relevant knowledge and technical capacity, including local and indigenous knowledge, to determine type of project and locations. 

  - Assess community needs and monitor existing ecosystems health to ensure fitting mix of plantings, management, and protection/ conservation to keep ecosystem healthy and thriving. 

  - Promote inclusion and participation with diverse community members and Microsoft employees. 

  - Improve equity by locating projects using Tree Equity Score (TES) for Urban Forestry in the US, and local community knowledge in international locations and ecological restoration projects. 

  - Ensure all selected species are well-suited to the project location to maximize biodiversity benefits, adapt to future climate conditions, and prevent potential harm from inappropriate species choices. 

  - Prioritize local partners with diversity of hiring/workforce and provide above living wages.

- The CES program aligns with Microsoft's corporate environmental commitments in areas such as carbon, water, waste, and ecosystems. The program also offers opportunities for community involvement and volunteerism to help amplify efforts.

## Hyperlocal datacenters

Hyperlocal datacenters are smaller facilities strategically located closer to end users. This proximity offers several benefits:

- Reduced environmental impact: By being closer to users, hyperlocal datacenters can minimize the need for extensive data transmission over long distances, which reduces energy consumption and carbon emissions. 

- Enhanced local economies: These datacenters can stimulate local economies by creating jobs, supporting local businesses, and improving infrastructure. 

- Improved connectivity: Hyperlocal datacenters can provide faster and more reliable internet access, benefiting residents, businesses, and schools in the area.
