Datacenter facilities play a vital role in boosting local, regional, and national economies. They contribute significantly to tax revenues through various channels such as business taxes, income taxes, goods and services taxes, and infrastructure levies. This, in turn, supports the funding of public services and enhances the overall well-being of communities. 

For example, Microsoft has developed a framework to guide how it engages with and supports the communities where it operates datacenters. This approach is called the **Microsoft Community Pledge**: to build and operate digital infrastructure that addresses societal challenges and creates benefits for communities. The pledge also highlights:

- Contributing to a sustainable future: Microsoft commits to design and operate its datacenters to support society's climate goals and become carbon negative, water positive and zero waste before 2030. 

- Advancing community prosperity and well-being: Microsoft commits to delivering significant local, economic, social and environmental benefits to the communities where they operate. 

- Operating responsibly as a good neighbor: Microsoft commits to partnering closely with communities and operate in a way that respects the local environment.

Datacenter developers recognize the need to engage with communities throughout the lifecycle of datacenters and the key element of this is called **Community Engagement**. This includes balancing operational demands with community needs, such as minimizing noise pollution, optimizing land use, and preserving local habitats.

- Examples of information supporting a Microsoft Community Engagement plan in the USA: East Point data center project and the Palmetto data center construction. These projects provide access to key resources such as project details, contact information, community FAQs, and development plans to enhance community understanding.

- Datacenter developers are also interested in learning about perception and understanding of datacenters and publish their findings to help the industry and communities learn how to continue to improve this engagement such as the 2024 CyrusOne Listening to Communities Report.

  - CyrusOne commissioned independent research company Census wide to conduct the survey. Census wide surveyed a representative sample of 13,129 general consumers aged 16 and over in seven countries. The report sought to learn:

    - Whether people understand what a data center is and the role they play in our digital lives.

    - Whether people are willing to have a data center in their community, and the factors that would make them more willing.

    - The community benefits that people do—and expect—to see from having data centers in their local area.

- A strong community focus can lead to meaningful changes in datacenter developments, especially when developers address local concerns and feedback. This might include adding soundproofing measures, creating green spaces, or repurposing old industrial sites to benefit the community.

- These initiatives complement or are part of existing local planning engagement requirements. Developers must meet these requirements to secure planning consent, facilitate public engagement, and keep stakeholders informed as mandated by local planning laws.

**Examples**: 

- In Tennessee, Google transformed unused land near its datacenters into parks and recreational spaces, turning potential challenges into valuable community assets. 

- In Quincy, Washington, Microsoft partnered with the local community to develop a sports complex that includes soccer fields, baseball diamonds, and other recreational facilities. This initiative helps promote physical activity and community engagement.
