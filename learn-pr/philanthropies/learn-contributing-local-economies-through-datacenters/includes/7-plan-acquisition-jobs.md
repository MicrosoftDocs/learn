Let's now look at various roles in the datacenter planning and acquisition stage:

## Lease and land development

There are several roles that help with processing initial land acquisition and leasing formalities for datacenter setup. Here are some important roles and respective responsibilities"

|Role|Responsibilities|
|----|---|
|Lease strategy and execution strategy managers|These individuals are responsible for creating and implementing the strategy for leasing datacenter space. This includes:</br>- Developing leasing strategies for clients, determining the types of leases to offer (e.g., short-term, long-term, wholesale, or retail).</br>- Negotiating lease terms with tenants (e.g., colocation customers).</br>- Ensuring the financial success of the lease agreements and maximizing the profitability of the leased space.
|Land acquisition managers| These individuals are responsible for creating and implementing the strategy for leasing datacenter space.

|Land due diligence managers|A Land Due Diligence Manager ensures that all factors related to a potential land acquisition are thoroughly researched and evaluated before making a commitment. Their responsibilities typically involve:</br>- Assessing land for its suitability for datacenter construction, considering aspects like environmental impact, geotechnical conditions, zoning, and regulatory compliance.</br>- Ensuring there are no legal, financial, or environmental risks associated with the land (such as existing land use restrictions, contamination, or disputes).</br>- Working closely with environmental consultants, legal teams, and regulatory authorities to confirm the land meets all the necessary criteria for datacenter development.|
|Real estate portfolio managers|They oversee and manage the company's real estate assets, ensuring the portfolio aligns with business objectives, operational needs, and financial goals. Their focus is on optimizing the performance, value, and utilization of real estate assets, which are critical for the growth and functionality of datacenter operations.|
|Power engineering program management|They focus on managing the power infrastructure needed to ensure the reliable and efficient operation of datacenters. They oversee the design, implementation, and maintenance of electrical systems that supply uninterrupted, high-capacity power to datacenters, which is one of the most critical aspects of their functionality.|


## Network infrastructure management
Network acquisition, OSP telecom engineering (On Site Planning), sourcing engineering (Purchasing), Subsea Operations, fiber delivery engineering. These roles are essential for ensuring the connectivity, scalability, and reliability of the network systems that support datacenters. Each role focuses on specific aspects of planning, acquiring, implementing, and maintaining the network infrastructure.

|Role|Responsibilities|
|----|---|
|Network acquisition|- Secures and acquires network assets, such as fiber-optic cables, bandwidth, and peering agreements, to ensure the datacenter has high speed, reliable internet and interconnectivity.</br>- Negotiates contracts with telecom providers, internet service providers (ISPs), and cloud interconnect partners.</br>- Analyzes the network demand and capacity needs for the datacenter to plan for current and future growth.|
|OSP telecom engineering (outside plant engineering/on-site planning)| - Designs, plans, and implements the physical network infrastructure outside the datacenter, such as underground or aerial fiber-optic cabling.</br>- Conducts site surveys to determine the best routes for fiber installation while avoiding obstacles like existing utilities, geographic challenges, or environmental restrictions.</br>- Coordinates with construction teams for trenching, conduit installation, and cable laying.</br>- Ensures compliance with local regulations, safety codes, and environmental considerations.|
|Sourcing engineering (purchasing)|- Sources and procures network-related equipment, components, and services required to build and maintain the datacenter's connectivity.</br>- Negotiates with vendors for switches, routers, fiber-optic cables, and other telecom equipment to get the best pricing and delivery terms.|
|Subsea operations|- Manage subsea fiber-optic cable systems, which connect datacenters across continents via undersea cables.</br>- Coordinate with global telecom providers and consortium to acquire bandwidth on existing subsea cables or participate in new cable projects.</br>- Oversee the maintenance, repair, and operation of subsea cable systems to ensure minimal downtime and high performance.|
|Fiber delivery engineering|- Oversees the design and deployment of fiber-optic infrastructure to deliver high-speed connectivity to and from the datacenter.</br>- Manages fiber buildouts, from construction planning to splicing and testing the fiber.</br>- Ensures the timely delivery of fiber networks by coordinating with contractors, vendors, and telecom providers.</br>- Tests and certifies fiber performance, including latency, bandwidth, and redundancy.|


## Sustainability managers

These roles focus on developing and implementing strategies to minimize the environmental impact of datacenter operations while ensuring efficiency and compliance with sustainability goals. Datacenters are known for their high energy and water consumption, so sustainability managers play a critical part in reducing carbon footprints, optimizing resource usage, and advancing green initiatives.

|Role|Responsibility|
|----|----|
|Energy efficiency management|Involves improving datacenter energy efficiency by optimizing cooling systems, server layouts, and power usage, achieving lower PUE ratios, and leveraging advanced technologies like liquid cooling and AI-driven energy management.
|Renewable energy integration|Sourcing renewable energy, negotiating Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs), and reducing reliance on fossil fuels to achieve carbon-neutral or net-zero energy goals for datacenters.|
|Water usage optimization|Focuses on minimizing water consumption for cooling by implementing efficient technologies like closed-loop and air cooling systems, tracking Water Usage Effectiveness (WUE), and developing improvement plans.|
|Carbon footprint reduction|Involves measuring and tracking GHG emissions, developing strategies to offset them through renewable energy credits, carbon capture, or reforestation, and ensuring the company meets its carbon reduction goals.|
|Sustainability certifications and compliance|Includes obtaining environmental certifications, ensuring compliance with regulations, and preparing sustainability reports for stakeholders, regulators, and clients.|
|Resource optimization|Focuses on reducing waste through recycling programs, responsible disposal of obsolete hardware, and promoting the use of sustainable materials in datacenter construction and maintenance.|
|Sustainability metrics and reporting|Involves developing and tracking KPIs like PUE, WUE, and carbon emissions, publishing sustainability reports, and using analytics to model environmental impacts and guide decisions.|
|Innovation and emerging technologies|Includes researching and adopting technologies like AI-driven energy optimization, sustainable cooling solutions, modular building designs, and on-site energy generation systems to reduce environmental impact.|
