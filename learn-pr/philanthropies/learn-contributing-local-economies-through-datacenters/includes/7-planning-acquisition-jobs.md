**Planning and acquisition:**

- **Lease and land development careers**: Lease strategy and execution strategy managers, land acquisition managers, land due diligence managers

  - **Lease Strategy and Execution Strategy Managers**: These individuals are responsible for creating and implementing the strategy for leasing datacenter space. This includes: 

    - Developing leasing strategies for clients, determining the types of leases to offer (e.g., short-term, long-term, wholesale, or retail). 

    - Negotiating lease terms with tenants (e.g., colocation customers). 

    - Ensuring the financial success of the lease agreements and maximizing the profitability of the leased space.

  - **Land Acquisition Managers:** These professionals focus on acquiring the land needed for building new datacenters or expanding existing ones. Their duties include:

    - Identifying suitable land parcels for development based on factors such as location, access to infrastructure (like power and fiber), environmental considerations, and zoning laws. 

    - Negotiating land purchases or long-term land lease agreements.

  - **Land Due Diligence Managers**: A Land Due Diligence Manager ensures that all factors related to a potential land acquisition are thoroughly researched and evaluated before making a commitment. Their responsibilities typically involve:

    - Assessing land for its suitability for datacenter construction, considering aspects like environmental impact, geotechnical conditions, zoning, and regulatory compliance. 

    - Ensuring there are no legal, financial, or environmental risks associated with the land (such as existing land use restrictions, contamination, or disputes). 

    - Working closely with environmental consultants, legal teams, and regulatory authorities to confirm the land meets all the necessary criteria for datacenter development.

- **Real estate portfolio managers**

  - They oversee and manage the company's real estate assets, ensuring the portfolio aligns with business objectives, operational needs, and financial goals. Their focus is on optimizing the performance, value, and utilization of real estate assets, which are critical for the growth and functionality of datacenter operations.

- **Power engineering program management**

  - They focus on managing the power infrastructure needed to ensure the reliable and efficient operation of datacenters. They oversee the design, implementation, and maintenance of electrical systems that supply uninterrupted, high-capacity power to datacenters, which is one of the most critical aspects of their functionality.

- **Network infrastructure management**: Network acquisition, OSP telecom engineering (On Site Planning), sourcing engineering (Purchasing), Subsea Operations, fiber delivery engineering. These roles are essential for ensuring the connectivity, scalability, and reliability of the network systems that support datacenters. Each role focuses on specific aspects of planning, acquiring, implementing, and maintaining the network infrastructure.

  - **Network acquisition**:

    - Secures and acquires network assets, such as fiber-optic cables, bandwidth, and peering agreements, to ensure the datacenter has high speed, reliable internet and interconnectivity. 

    - Negotiates contracts with telecom providers, internet service providers (ISPs), and cloud interconnect partners. 

    - Analyzes the network demand and capacity needs for the datacenter to plan for current and future growth.

  - **OSP telecom engineering (outside plant engineering/on-site planning):**

    - Designs, plans, and implements the physical network infrastructure outside the datacenter, such as underground or aerial fiber-optic cabling.

    - Conducts site surveys to determine the best routes for fiber installation while avoiding obstacles like existing utilities, geographic challenges, or environmental restrictions.

    - Coordinates with construction teams for trenching, conduit installation, and cable laying. 

    - Ensures compliance with local regulations, safety codes, and environmental considerations.

  - **Sourcing engineering (purchasing):**

    - Sources and procures network-related equipment, components, and services required to build and maintain the datacenter's connectivity. 

    - Negotiates with vendors for switches, routers, fiber-optic cables, and other telecom equipment to get the best pricing and delivery terms.

  - **Subsea operations:**

    - Manage subsea fiber-optic cable systems, which connect datacenters across continents via undersea cables. 

    - Coordinate with global telecom providers and consortiums to acquire bandwidth on existing subsea cables or participate in new cable projects. 

    - Oversee the maintenance, repair, and operation of subsea cable systems to ensure minimal downtime and high performance.

  - **Fiber delivery engineering:**

    - Oversees the design and deployment of fiber-optic infrastructure to deliver high-speed connectivity to and from the datacenter. 

    - Manages fiber buildouts, from construction planning to splicing and testing the fiber. 

    - Ensures the timely delivery of fiber networks by coordinating with contractors, vendors, and telecom providers.

    - Tests and certifies fiber performance, including latency, bandwidth, and redundancy.

- **Sustainability managers:** These roles focus on developing and implementing strategies to minimize the environmental impact of datacenter operations while ensuring efficiency and compliance with sustainability goals. Datacenters are known for their high energy and water consumption, so sustainability managers play a critical part in reducing carbon footprints, optimizing resource usage, and advancing green initiatives.
