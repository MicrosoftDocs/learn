Personalized learning is a way of supporting every learner in a way that best suits their needs, interests, and choices. A few of the elements you can apply to personalized learning are explained here:

- **Contextual activities**. When learners connect their learning to their personal life or culture, the learning momentum improves. Activities like these make the acquired knowledge more relatable and, therefore, more impactful.
- **Independence in learning**. When learners are empowered to establish their own learning objectives, they can map their own educational path and learn from their mistakes.
- **Recognition of uniqueness**. Every learner is unique, possessing a wide range of needs, interests, and abilities. When their unique traits and differences are recognized, they feel more appreciated and, as a result, they comprehend the content better.
- **Freedom in learning**. When learners have the freedom to choose their learning path, their motivation and retention increase. Giving learners the option to choose helps them select a path that is suitable for their needs.

Traditional education often revolves around an educator presenting a subject to a large group of learners, all learning simultaneously. However, this method overlooks the fact that every learner is unique and has their own distinct learning style and pace. Personalized learning addresses this matter. It shapes the learning experience based on each learner's abilities, needs, and interests.

Technology can play a crucial role in supporting personalized learning. Tools like Microsoft OneNote and Microsoft Teams can support trainers in recognizing, tracking, and enhancing learner engagement, well-being, and collaboration. Let's explore how AI-powered tools can support personalized learning:

- **A trainer creates a personalized notebook for each learner in their session using Microsoft OneNote**. They then share content, assignments, and feedback with each learner through their individual notebooks. For example, the trainer might share a video on a specific topic and then provide each learner with personalized follow-up questions based on their interests and learning needs. The trainer can also use Microsoft OneNote to track each learner's progress and provide personalized feedback on their assignments.
- **A trainer uses Microsoft Teams to facilitate synchronous learning between learners when they work in small groups virtually**. The trainer creates a team for the learner group and sets up channels for different project groups. Learners can use Microsoft Teams to share ideas, discuss their progress, and provide feedback on each other's work. The trainer can also use this application to provide personalized feedback and support to each group as they work on their project. For example, the trainer might use the chat feature to provide real-time feedback on a group's written work or use the video call feature to conduct virtual meetings with each group to discuss their progress.

Employing AI for personalized learning can have a significant impact. You can use AI to cater to the distinctive requirements of each learner, promoting a compelling, efficient, and diverse educational environment. Learners are better prepared to reach their full potential by adopting this approach.
