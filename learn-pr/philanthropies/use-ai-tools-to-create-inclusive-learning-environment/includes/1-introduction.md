Personalized learning is an approach to customize learning for each learner focusing on their strengths, needs, interests, and skills. This method contrasts with the traditional educational model, ensuring that each learner's unique attributes are considered to maximize engagement, knowledge retention, and professional development.

Imagine a trainer who is preparing a training session for a diverse group of learners, including those with low vision. The trainer decides to utilize Microsoft's Seeing AI, an innovative tool that describes the visual world, turning the visual into an audible experience. During the session, the trainer shares images and diagrams related to the training content. Seeing AI narrates the visual elements, enabling learners with low vision to participate fully and equally, fostering an inclusive learning environment.

In this module, you will learn how personalized learning can be enhanced through AI tools. These tools help you, the trainer, recognize each learner's journey, allowing for the differentiation of instruction based on individual readiness and interests. With the integration of AI-powered tools, training sessions are evolving from a standardized process to a dynamic, learner-centered experience, where every learner's potential can be fully realized.
