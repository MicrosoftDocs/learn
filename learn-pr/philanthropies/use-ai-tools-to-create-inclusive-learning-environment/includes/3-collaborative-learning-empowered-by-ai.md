AI-powered communication and collaboration tools are redefining education. These applications integrate various features such as voice, video, messaging, chat, and task management. The result is a versatile platform that can facilitate a more dynamic, interactive, and productive learning journey.

Collaborative learning is a powerful tool that allows you to engage with learners. When used within a small circle of learners, collaborative learning can enhance engagement, encourage peer learning, and accommodate diverse learners' skills. With the integration of AI, collaborative learning becomes even more effective and efficient.

Collaborative learning can be done through synchronous or asynchronous learning. Considering how prevalent blended learning becomes, you need to find a way to create an online learning environment that effectively supports collaboration. One way to facilitate collaborative learning is by using technology such as Microsoft Teams. Learners can collaborate with each other in real-time, share ideas, and work together on projects by using these tools.

Features such as virtual breakout rooms, collaborative document editing, and AI-driven insights allow you to create dynamic learning environments in which learners can collaborate seamlessly, regardless of their physical location. By moving communication online, learners can keep their project records organized and minimize miscommunication.

There are plenty of activities that allow learners to collaborate online. You can apply AI to generate activity suggestions and instructions, enhancing the quality of group discussions, and ensuring that learning outcomes are met effectively. Learners can also use AI to enrich their group discussions and provide ideas for their projects.

You can incorporate AI into collaborative projects by asking groups to curate resources around a specific research topic with AI tools like Bing Chat. Learners can also use tools like Microsoft Speaker Coach to improve their group's presentation skills. By getting feedback from Microsoft Speaker Coach, learners can identify their strengths and improve their weaknesses.

In conclusion, AI transforms collaborative learning. By using tools such as Microsoft Teams, Bing Chat, and Microsoft Speaker Coach, you can facilitate engaging small group discussions and collaboration. AI empowers you to create a learning environment in which learners actively participate in real-time.
