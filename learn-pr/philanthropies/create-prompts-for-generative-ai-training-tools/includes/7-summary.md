A prompt is a text-based input that tells a generative AI model what to do and how to do it. A prompt has two main components: instruction and context. The instruction states the task and the objective for the model, while the context provides information for the model's output.

Prompt engineering is the skill of crafting prompts that produce the desired output from the model. The quality and effectiveness of the prompt affects the quality and effectiveness of the model's output. To create good prompts, the user needs to utilize their critical thinking skills to write descriptive language to define the desired output and communicate it clearly and specifically to the model. With the skill of prompt engineering, you're now ready to create, produce, and design with generative AI.
