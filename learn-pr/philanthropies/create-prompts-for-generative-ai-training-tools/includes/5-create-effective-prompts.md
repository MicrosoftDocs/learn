Effective prompt design is essential to achieving desired outcomes with generative AI models. To create effective prompts, follow the practices below:

- **Be specific**. When instructing AI to generate image content, include as many details as possible. For example, specify the style, viewpoint, and lighting conditions. Experiment with the phrasing by modifying it in different ways. Adding extra details to your prompt can result in a significantly different outcome.
- **Choose the right mode for the task**. While utilizing Copilot, choose the right 'mode' for the content you want to generate. For example, Copilot has three conversation styles from which to choose. Use 'more creative' for imaginative content such as stories or poems; 'more precise' for information; and 'more balanced' for generic scenarios.
- **Ensure factual accuracy**. To achieve factual accuracy, choose the 'more precise' conversation style, which tends to base responses on web-based sources. Critically examine the references to ensure the AI model accurately interprets the text. Direct the AI model to summarize specific information instead of asking open-ended questions.
- **Customize outputs**. You can influence a response by specifying the complexity level. Asking the AI model to explain like a learner versus asking the model to respond like a university professor will yield different responses.
- **Switch topics effectively**. Click on the 'New Topic' button on Copilot to change the conversation's focus in Copilot. 'New Topic' gives the model a fresh start, preventing confusion caused by blending unrelated topics.
- **Specify output length**. AI models can compose outputs of a specific length. If it stops without a satisfactory response, prompt it to continue.
- **Utilize varied formats**. AI models can present data in diverse formats, including tables, outlines, diagrams, and flow charts that can help learners visualize complex information, easing comprehension and interpretation.
