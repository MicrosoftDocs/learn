Large language models (LLMs) are a type of neural network architecture that can process and generate conversational text, write code, abstract information, answer questions and process text in a myriad of ways. LLMs have been trained on vast amounts of text data and can generate human-like text across a wide range of tasks. GPT is a type of LLM.

Due to extensive training from billions of language samples, including books, articles, and websites, LLMs can perform a variety of natural language tasks, such as:

1. **Classification**. LLMs can assign predefined labels or categories such as positive, negative, spam, not spam, news, or opinion to texts based on meaning and context. LLMs can even identify the sentiment of a text.
1. **Summarization**. LLMs can extract the most crucial and relevant information from text, such as news articles, product reviews, and research papers, and then compose concise and coherent summaries.
1. **Translation**. LLMs can translate text between various languages while preserving the context and structure of the original text.
1. **Content generation**. LLMs can create new and original text such as stories, poems, jokes, slogans, and captions from given input or prompts. LLMs can also generate codes in languages like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python.
