Generative AI models are transforming digital interactions through conversational texts. These models are trained on data and can generate coherent responses that allow users to engage with AI in a natural way. Microsoft Copilot, a generative AI tool, can be your training virtual assistant by helping you organize ideas, create content, analyze data, craft email responses, and more to help keep your trainings effective and organized.

By understanding the basics of generative AI, you enhance your ability to make responsible and efficient decisions. This knowledge equips you with a deeper understanding of how generative AI systems generate content and make predictions, allowing you to evaluate their outputs critically. With this understanding, you can better assess the reliability, identify potential limitations, and make informed decisions about how to interact with generative AI in your personal life and training environment.
