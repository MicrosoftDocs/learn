Generative AI is a term for AI systems that recognize patterns in significant and complex data sets to generate original text, voice, and images based on these patterns. While some AI systems can make predictions based on existing data, generative AI is designed to use the patterns provided to generate entirely new content. As a result, generative AI tools don't create the same output twice for the same input. 

**Two types of generative AI models**:  

1. **Natural language generation**
   Natural Language Generation (NLG) is a branch of AI that generates texts like how humans write. NLG supports applications that can process text and speech such as Generative Pretrained Transformer (GPT). GPT, a type of Large language model, can process a given prompt and generate a natural response. A practical example is Microsoft Copilot, which uses this technology to generate relevant and coherent responses.  
1. **Text to image**
   In text to image, an AI model generates an image based on a text prompt. A text-to-image model like the one in Microsoft Copilot, can generate icons, patterns, illustrations, artwork, imaginary photos, and depictions of 3D objects.
