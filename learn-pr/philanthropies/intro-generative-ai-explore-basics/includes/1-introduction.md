Generative AI is transforming the way people interact digitally and receive information. Their ongoing evolution is driving a shift towards more nuanced, accessible, and personalized experiences.

For instance, a Large language model (LLM) which powers Microsoft Copilot, is a form of a generative AI model. LLMs can process and generate conversational text, write code, receive information over a topic, and process text in array of styles. Generative AI tools like Microsoft Copilot have been trained on vast amounts of data and can even generate responses by predicting what words should come next in a sentence to construct a fully coherent statement. This capability is what allows users to interact with AI in a more natural and intuitive manner, enhancing their engagement and accessibility.  

This module offers a foundational look at how generative AI is shaping the landscape of AI applications. It aims to help you recognize the various ways generative AI models are being utilized in practical contexts, from content creation and personalized marketing to virtual assistants, analytics, and forecasting. By exploring and understanding practical applications, you can then identify opportunities to incorporate generative AI into your life and trainings efficiently and responsibly.
