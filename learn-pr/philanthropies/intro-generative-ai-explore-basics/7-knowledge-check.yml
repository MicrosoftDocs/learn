  title: Check your knowledge
  questions: 
    - content: "What tasks can Large Language Models (LLMS) perform due to their extensive training on vast amounts of text?"
      choices:
        - content: "LLMs can predict the weather accurately based on historical data."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. LLMs aren't trained for weather prediction; their strength lies in natural language processing."
        - content: "LLMs can assign predefined labels or categories to texts, such as sentiment analysis."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct. LLMs can assign predefined labels or categories to texts based on context and meaning given."
        - content: "LLMs can generate 3D models from natural language descriptions."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. While LLMs can process text, they can't directly generate 3D models from natural language descriptions."
    - content: "Which of the following statements accurately describes Natural Language Generation (NLG)?"
      choices:
        - content: "NLG is a subfield of AI that generates texts like how humans write."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct. NLG is a subfield of AI that generates human-like texts. It focuses on creating coherent and relevant responses in natural language."
        - content: "NLG is a type of Large Language Model that generates images from texts."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. Text to image AI model generates images. NLG deals with texts."
        - content: "NLG is a type of AI model that creates visual outputs from natural language inputs."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. NLG doesn't create visual outputs."
    - content: "Which of the following critical thinking skills is essential for ensuring accuracy and impartiality in content generated by a Large Language Models (LLM)?"
      choices:
        - content: "Analysis"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. Analysis is about understanding relationships within the content, not necessarily determining its quality."
        - content: "Synthesis"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. Synthesis involves combining ideas but doesn't directly ensure accuracy."
        - content: "Evaluation"
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct. Evaluation involves assessing the quality and credibility of the content, which helps ensure the responsible usage of an LLM."
