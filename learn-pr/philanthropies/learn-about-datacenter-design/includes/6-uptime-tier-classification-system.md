The Uptime Institute is a globally recognized organization that provides standards, certifications, and consulting services to ensure the performance, reliability, and efficiency of datacenters. It was founded in 1993 and is best known for its Tier Classification System, which evaluates and certifies datacenters based on their design, construction, and operational performance.

There're four levels (Tiers I to IV), each offering different uptime guarantees and redundancy (backup systems).

|Tier|Description|
|---|---|
|**Tier I: Basic Infrastructure** (Low Reliability)|- Uptime: 99.671% (around 28.8 hours of downtime per year). </br>- Backup: No redundancy.</br>- Best For: Small businesses with simple IT needs.  |
|**Tier II: Partial Redundancy** (Moderate Reliability)|- Uptime: 99.741% (around 22 hours of downtime per year).</br>- Backup: Some redundancy in power and cooling systems.</br>- Best For: Businesses that need reliable systems without breaking the bank.|
|**Tier III: Concurrently Maintainable** (High Reliability)|- Uptime: 99.982% (around 1.6 hours of downtime per year).</br>- Backup: All critical systems can be maintained without downtime.</br>- Best For: Companies needing 24/7 operations, like large enterprises.|
|**Tier IV: Fault-Tolerant** (Very High Reliability)|- Uptime: 99.995% (around 26.3 minutes of downtime per year).</br>- Backup: Complete redundancy for all critical systems.</br>- Best For: Industries where downtime isn't an option, like banking, healthcare, and cloud services.  

The Uptime Institute doesn't officially recognize a Tier V classification. However, the term "Tier V" is sometimes informally used in marketing or discussions to describe extremely high performance datacenters that exceed Tier IV specifications, such as:

- 100% uptime guarantees.
- Advanced features like distributed, multi-location fault tolerance.
- Sustainable and energy-efficient designs.

These claims don't align with the Uptime Institute's official standards but may reflect innovations or custom standards created by specific companies or industries.

For official datacenter classification, **Tier IV** remains the highest level.
