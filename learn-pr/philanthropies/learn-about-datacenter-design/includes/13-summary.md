This module delved into the key factors of datacenter design and architecture. We examined site selection considerations, including power availability, climate, and natural disaster risks.

The module also covered the layout of datacenters, focusing on topologies, IT infrastructure, and space allocation.

Additionally, we explored critical infrastructure components like power and cooling systems, and the role of Data Center Infrastructure Management (DCIM) and Building Management Systems (BMS) in monitoring datacenter operations.
