Did you ever ask yourself why most datacenters you come across are sprawling single-story buildings or clusters of buildings, rather than towering skyscrapers? The answer lies in practicality. Single-story datacenters have been the standard for a long time due to their simpler infrastructure management, easier maintenance, and lower costs.

However, as urban areas face increasing land constraints and higher real estate prices, there’s been a shift towards multi-story datacenters. These designs maximize space in areas where horizontal expansion isn’t feasible. For example, companies like Equinix have developed multi-story facilities, some as tall as 12 stories, to meet the rising demand for computing power in dense urban settings.
But even with this trend, single-story datacenters still dominate the landscape globally, remaining the preferred choice for most operators (for now).

|  | Single-story datacenters | Multi-story datacenters |
| - | - | - |
| Advantages | • **Easier layout planning**: Equipment can be laid out more efficiently on a single level, simplifying cooling, power distribution, and cable management.<br>• **Accessibility**: Maintenance is often easier because technicians don’t need to navigate elevators or stairs to reach equipment.<br>• **Cooling efficiency**: Cooling systems can be more straightforward in a single-story layout, as airflow and temperature management don’t need to account for multiple levels.<br>• **Cost-effective**: For locations with plenty of land, single-story construction is typically less expensive than building vertically.<br>• **Power distribution**: Power cabling can be more direct and cost-effective without the need for vertical risers and additional distribution equipment for multiple floors.<br>• **Scalability**: It’s easier to expand horizontally (add wings or pods) in a single-story design compared to modifying or expanding a multi-story facility.<br>• **Security and fire risk management**: A single-story design simplifies physical security by reducing entry points and the complexity of securing multiple levels. Fire suppression systems are easier to implement and manage in single-level facilities. | • **Efficient use of space**: Multi-story designs are ideal for urban areas where land is scarce and expensive. They allow for higher data capacity within a smaller land footprint.<br>• **Scalability in tight areas**: Multi-story builds enable expansion vertically, making them suitable for future growth in dense regions.<br>• **Reduced latency in edge deployments**: In urban environments, proximity to users is critical. Multi-story datacenters can meet the need for low-latency operations in cities.<br>• **Energy efficiency opportunities**: Multi-story facilities can implement floor-specific cooling zones, optimizing energy use based on equipment density on each floor. Advanced vertical power distribution systems can reduce losses, especially in modern designs with integrated energy management. |
| Challenges | • **Land requirements**: A single-story design requires more horizontal space, which may not be feasible in land-constrained urban areas.<br>• **Security perimeter**: A larger footprint means more area to secure, which can increase costs. | • **Complex cooling and power systems**: Vertical designs require more advanced systems to distribute power and manage cooling efficiently across multiple floors.<br>• **Structural considerations**: Floors must be engineered to support the heavy weight of racks and equipment, increasing construction complexity and cost.<br>• **Accessibility**: Maintenance and equipment replacement can be more challenging, as elevators or stairwells are needed to move hardware between floors. |
