 title: Learn about datacenter design, architecture, and infrastructure management
 description: In this module, we'll explore the key factors of datacenter design, delving into why they're crucial for building a reliable, scalable, and efficient infrastructure. You'll learn about site selection considerations such as power availability, climate, and risks from natural disasters. We'll also look at the layout of a datacenter, covering important elements like topologies, IT infrastructure, and space allocation. By the end of this module, you understand the importance of a well-architected datacenter.
