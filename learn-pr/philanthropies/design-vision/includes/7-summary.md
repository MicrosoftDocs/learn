AI tools are changing how people plan music videos, making the process faster, easier, and more collaborative. In this module, we look at how Microsoft Designer and Copilot help with important preproduction steps like coming up with ideas, building storyboards, and writing scripts.

We start by looking at how AI supports creativity and planning. Microsoft Designer lets you turn text prompts into high-quality images, which helps bring your scenes to life visually. Copilot helps with script writing by breaking down scenes, improving descriptions, and taking team feedback to shape a clear and creative storyline.

During the hands-on activities, learners use these AI tools to come up with their own music video ideas, outline scripts, and create visual storyboards. Along the way, they learn how to give better prompts, fine-tune the AI's suggestions, and work with others to build strong creative projects.

Using AI during preproduction helps music video creators tell better stories, come up with ideas more quickly, and move smoothly from planning to production. This approach gives artists, directors, and production teams more freedom to explore creative ideas while staying organized and on track.
