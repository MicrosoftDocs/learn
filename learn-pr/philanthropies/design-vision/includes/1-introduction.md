In this session, learners explore AI-assisted preproduction and storyboarding for music videos. They discover how AI tools like Microsoft Designer and Copilot enhance the creative planning process—from generating initial concepts to developing structured storyboards and script outlines. Through hands-on activities, participants use these tools to craft a preliminary music video concept, refine their ideas with AI-generated insights, and incorporate their own creative vision. The session wraps up with reflections on AI's role in streamlining and improving the preproduction workflow.

## Scenario

You're a freelance music video director meeting with an independent artist who wants a visually compelling video for their new song but struggles to articulate their vision. To streamline the creative process, you listen to the song and identify key themes, emotions, and imagery that shape the concept. Using Copilot, you generate a structured music video idea and refine it collaboratively to match the artist's style. With Microsoft Designer, you create AI-generated storyboard visuals that bring the concept to life, offering a clear visual representation of the video's key scenes. When you present your idea, the artist feels impressed by the professional, well-structured pitch—it helps them see and approve the direction of their video. By using AI tools, you boost collaboration, speed up preproduction, and deliver a polished, compelling creative proposal.

## What are we doing?

We explore how AI assists in the preproduction process of music video creation and apply AI tools to improve planning and storyboarding:

* **Introduce**: How does AI support creative decision-making in the preproduction stage?
* **Storyboard**: How does Microsoft Designer help visualize key scenes effectively?
* **Script**: How does Copilot assist with generating and refining music video script ideas?
* **Create**: How do we build a compelling video concept using AI-generated insights?
* **Collaborate**: How do AI tools improve teamwork and streamline the creative process?
* **Apply**: How do we use these tools in a hands-on activity to create a structured music video concept?

## What is the main goal?

By the end of this session, learners understand how AI tools support creative decision-making, improve efficiency in planning, and assist with storyboarding and script writing—setting the stage for hands-on application.
