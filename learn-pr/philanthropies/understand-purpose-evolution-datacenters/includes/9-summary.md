In this module, we explored the basics of datacenters, including their purpose, evolution, and types.

We learned about the critical role datacenters play in modern IT infrastructure, supporting services like cloud computing, online gaming, web hosting, and more.

The module also covered the core components of datacenters, such as power supply, cooling, and security, and highlighted the importance of datacenters in enabling various digital services and technologies.
