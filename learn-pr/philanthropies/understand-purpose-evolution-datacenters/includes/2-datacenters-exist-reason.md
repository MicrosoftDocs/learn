Without datacenters, many of the services, technologies, and operations we rely on daily wouldn't be possible. Without datacenters, we would lose access to cloud computing, e-commerce, communication platforms, real-time media streaming, financial services, and many other critical technologies that define our connected world.

Let's look at some of the major areas supported by datacenters and what would no longer be possible or even exist if datacenters weren't present to support them.

| Major areas supported by datacenters | Example | Without datacenters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Cloud Computing Services | Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform | Cloud storage, cloud computing, and cloud-based applications would not exist. Without datacenters, businesses and individuals could not access scalable computing resources on-demand. Companies would need to own and maintain their own physical infrastructure for every service, which would be cost-prohibitive and inefficient. |
| Online Gaming | Fortnite, Call of Duty, Xbox Cloud Gaming | Multiplayer games and cloud gaming wouldn’t exist. Without datacenters, players couldn’t connect to remote servers for real-time interactions, hosting, or matchmaking. Cloud gaming wouldn’t allow highperformance games to be streamed to low-powered devices, and massive online worlds with persistent data would be impossible to maintain.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;• Online multiplayer games require dedicated servers to host the game worlds and facilitate communication between players. These servers are typically housed in datacenters. When you play a game like Fortnite, Call of Duty, or World of Warcraft, the game does not run solely on your console or PC—it connects to a remote server hosted in a datacenter.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;• Cloud gaming is another area where datacenters have played a transformative role. With cloud gaming services like NVIDIA GeForce Now, and Xbox Cloud Gaming, players can play high-performance video games on devices that don’t have the necessary processing power to run these games locally (like smartphones or low-end PCs).<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;• In any multiplayer game, especially massive ones with millions of players (such as Minecraft or League of Legends), all the interactions between players need to be synchronized in real-time. This includes player actions, in-game world states, player inventories, and more.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;• Many games feature persistent worlds—virtual environments that continue to evolve even when the player is not logged in. These worlds are powered by datacenters, which store the state of the game, player progress, and interactions. In games like EVE Online or Second Life, players can leave the game, but the world keeps running, evolving, and reacting to the actions of other players. Datacenters ensure that these worlds are always active, with data being saved and synchronized in real-time. |
| Web Hosting and Websites | Websites like Facebook, Google, Reddit | Hosting websites and providing content over the internet would be impossible without datacenters. They provide the infrastructure needed to store, process, and serve the vast amounts of data (images, videos, text) that websites rely on. |
| Streaming Services | Netflix, YouTube, Spotify | Streaming media (videos, music, live broadcasts) in real-time would not be feasible. Datacenters store and distribute massive amounts of multimedia content efficiently to users around the world. |
| Online Banking and Financial Transactions | Online banking, stock trading platforms, PayPal | Real-time financial transactions, secure data storage, and processing would be impossible without datacenters. They handle the secure, rapid transactions that allow for digital banking, investing, and payments. |
| E-Commerce and Online Retail | Amazon, Etsy, Shopify | Operating large-scale online stores and managing customer data, inventory, and transactions at scale would not be possible. Datacenters ensure e-commerce websites can function continuously and efficiently, handling thousands or millions of transactions per day. |
| Communication Platforms and Social Media (Including Email) | Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, WhatsApp, Zoom, Gmail, TikTok, Outlook | Instant messaging, social media interactions, video conferencing, and email would not be feasible without datacenters. These platforms rely on datacenters to ensure fast, secure, and reliable communication across various forms—whether through social media posts, direct messages, video calls, or email. |
| Big Data Analytics and Artificial Intelligence (AI) | Machine learning, data mining, predictive analytics | Processing massive amounts of data to derive insights, train AI models, and perform complex analytics would be impractical without datacenters. They provide the high-performance computing resources needed for AI, big data, and machine learning applications.  |
| IoT (Internet of Things) Ecosystem | Smart homes, connected cars, wearable health devices | The collection, processing, and storage of data generated by billions of connected devices would be impossible. Datacenters enable IoT networks by managing and analyzing data from a large number of sensors and devices in real-time. |
| Online Education and Remote Work | Platforms like Zoom, Google Classroom, Microsoft Teams, Udemy, Coursera | The modern shift to online education and remote work, which heavily relies on video conferencing, collaboration tools, and virtual classrooms, would not be possible without the infrastructure of datacenters. They host the platforms and services that support these activities. |
| Healthcare and Telemedicine | Electronic Health Records (EHR), telemedicine services | Storing and securely accessing health data, providing telemedicine consultations, and enabling digital healthcare services would not be feasible without the infrastructure provided by datacenters. They store patient records, process medical images, and handle data for real-time health monitoring. |
