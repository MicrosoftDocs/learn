While Microsoft Copilot is great for coming up with ideas and building content, it really shines when you're working with a team. In postproduction, collaboration is key—whether you're working with an artist, a director, or a small crew. Copilot helps with teamwork by giving smart suggestions, generating new options, and guiding creative choices in real time during editing.

## Collaborative editing with Microsoft Copilot

### How Copilot helps teams edit together

Copilot isn't just for solo projects—it's built to support feedback, discussion, and shared creativity. Here's how it helps teams during postproduction:

- **Real-time suggestions**  
  While you're editing in Clipchamp or using Microsoft 365 tools, Copilot suggests visual effects, transitions, or dialogue changes based on what you're working on.

- **Compare different versions**  
  Copilot tracks scene variations so you can look at two or more options side by side and easily go back to a previous version if needed.

- **Creative brainstorming with prompts**  
  Team members can type in prompts like:  
  - "Make this transition feel more cinematic."  
  - "Suggest a dreamlike visual effect for this scene."  
  - "How can we make the ending more emotional?"  
  Copilot gives clear suggestions and ideas you can try right away.

- **Fast and easy feedback**  
  Whether you're editing live or reviewing a rough cut, Copilot makes it simple to give and apply feedback quickly—without slowing down your workflow.

### Example: real-time feedback in action

Here's how you might use Copilot in a real project:

1. You finish a rough cut in Clipchamp using visuals from Designer and effects Copilot suggested.  
1. The artist or director joins a virtual feedback session.  
1. They say, "This scene change feels too sharp."  
1. You type a prompt into Copilot:  
   - "Suggest a smoother transition between Scene 3 and Scene 4 with a dreamy style."  
1. Copilot offers a few ideas—like a slow fade, a light flare effect, or soft color shifts.  
1. You test one, watch the update, and ask for more feedback.  
1. If it works, great! If not, Copilot helps you try another version or go back to what you had.

## Why use Copilot for team editing?

- **Saves time on changes**  
  You don't have to wait for back-and-forth edits—Copilot turns feedback into edits on the spot.

- **Keeps everyone aligned**  
  Copilot helps turn big-picture feedback into specific edits that match the creative vision.

- **Helps solve creative blocks**  
  When you're stuck or the feedback isn't clear, Copilot offers new ways to move forward.

With Copilot, team editing becomes smoother, faster, and more creative—so your final video feels polished and truly collaborative.
