While Microsoft Designer is great for creating storyboards and concept art, it also plays a big role in postproduction. At this stage, you use Designer not just to show your idea—but to shape the **visual identity** of your final music video. Whether you're adding overlays, custom backgrounds, or graphics for promotion, Designer gives you tools to create a consistent, cinematic look that ties everything together.

In the last module, you used Designer to build the visuals for your storyboard and teaser. Now, you expand on those designs and create new ones that add more style, detail, and personality to your finished video.

### Ways to use Designer for visual touches

Microsoft Designer uses AI prompts and smart design suggestions to help you create visuals that match your creative vision. Here are some ways to use it during postproduction:

- **Scene-specific graphics**  
  Make extra visuals to layer onto your scenes—like light flares, glitch textures, color tints, or abstract shapes that boost the emotion or match the rhythm.

- **Stylized backgrounds and transitions**  
  Create cool visual pieces to use between scenes. For example, you might ask Designer to “create a neon glitch screen for a transition” to give your video a strong visual style.

- **Custom title cards and overlays**  
  Build title screens, credits, lyric cards, or visual quotes that match your theme. Export them and bring them into Clipchamp to layer into your edit.

- **Motion ideas for Clipchamp**  
  Use Designer to sketch or plan ideas for moving visuals or effects. Then use Clipchamp's motion templates or overlays to bring those ideas to life.

### Tips for making great visuals

- **Let the song guide the style**  
  A slow, emotional song might work best with soft lighting and muted colors. A fast, high-energy song might call for bold colors, sharp contrast, and graphic elements.

- **Use style prompts to refine your designs**  
  Try adding visual details to your prompts. For example:  
  - “Glowing city street, cyberpunk style”  
  - “Grainy vintage film look, soft 90s colors”

- **Keep the look consistent**  
  Pick a few visual themes—like a color scheme, texture, or filter—and use them across scenes so your video feels connected and polished.

- **Less can be more**  
  Use visuals to support your story, not steal the spotlight. Subtle effects often look more professional than heavy-handed ones.

### Final step: add designs to your video

When you finish your designs, export them from Designer in high quality (PNG or JPEG for images, MP4 for motion if available). Then, import them into Clipchamp and layer them over your timeline to complete your scenes.

Using Designer this way lets you move beyond basic images and unlock another level of creativity—making your music video feel not just finished, but unforgettable.
