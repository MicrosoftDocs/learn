Once your music video assets are ready, the next step is to pull everything together in the edit. **Microsoft Clipchamp** is a browser-based video editor powered by AI. It's built to make editing fast, easy to learn, and flexible for your creative needs. Whether you're just starting out or already have experience, Clipchamp's tools help you clean up footage, sync it to music, and give your video a polished, professional look.

Earlier, you used Clipchamp to create a short teaser video. You brought in visuals from **Microsoft Designer**, used **Copilot** to suggest transitions, and synced clips to your music. Now, you build on those skills to create a full-length video with more advanced tools and AI features.

### Step-by-step: editing your music video

Clipchamp gives you a simple drag-and-drop timeline and smart AI tools to help you edit your video with confidence. Here's how to go from teaser to full final cut:

1. **Import your media**  
   Upload your visuals from **Designer**, your music track, and any extra clips into the Clipchamp media library. You can also bring in updated visuals based on feedback.

1. **Build your timeline**  
   Put your clips in the right order using the storyboard you made earlier. Trim, split, or stretch clips to adjust the timing. Use the full timeline to expand your teaser into a full video.

1. **Use AI-powered editing tools**  
   Try **Auto Composition** to help organize your scenes and keep transitions smooth. Clipchamp's AI helps with shot choices and scene flow based on the music and visuals.

1. **Add transitions and effects**  
   Pick from lots of built-in transitions like crossfades, zooms, and motion overlays. You can also use filters to give your video a certain look—like "retro VHS," "dreamy glow," or "gritty noir."

1. **Adjust the audio**  
   Add your full track, then tweak volume levels, fade-ins and outs, or transitions between sounds. Use AI tools to reduce background noise, balance the sound, and sync to the beat.

1. **Add text and motion graphics**  
   Include titles, subtitles, or animated lyrics. These add style and help tell the story. You can use visuals you made in **Designer** or grab templates inside Clipchamp.

1. **Preview and make changes**  
   Watch your video and fine-tune things like clip length, transitions, and effects. Use real-time suggestions from **Copilot** to try new edits and get creative ideas.

1. **Export your final cut**  
   When everything looks good, export your video in the right resolution—1080p for social media or 4K for bigger screens. Clipchamp makes it easy to share to YouTube, Teams, or download locally.
