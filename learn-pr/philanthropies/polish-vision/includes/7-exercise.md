**Materials needed**

- Access to Microsoft Clipchamp, Designer, and Copilot  
- Your music video teaser from Session 2  
- The same song you've been using  
- Headphones (recommended)

## Step-by-step instructions

### Part 1: Review your video

1. Watch your music video teaser from Session 2.
1. Make a simple plan for what to improve. Look for:
   - 2–3 spots that could use color changes or visual upgrades  
   - Any timing that feels off  
   - Transitions that could be smoother  
   - Places to add text or custom visuals

### Part 2: Edit with Clipchamp

1. Open your project in **Clipchamp**.

1. Use **AI color tools**:
   - Try auto color grading to keep your video looking consistent  
   - Use filters to match the song's mood  

1. Fix **audio timing**:
   - Use beat detection to sync visuals to the music  
   - Adjust clips to make the rhythm and emotions feel right  

1. Add **better transitions**:
   - Replace basic cuts with AI-suggested transitions  
   - Choose ones that support the story and tone of your video  

### Part 3: Design custom graphics

1. Open **Microsoft Designer**.

1. Create at least **two** of the following:
   - A lower-third text (like the artist name or song title)  
   - An end card or outro with credits or release info  
   - A graphic overlay for your favorite shot  
   - An animated title or logo  

1. Use a prompt like:  
   "Design a clean lower-third graphic for a music video called '[your song title].' It should match the [genre] style and use colors that fit with the video's look."

1. Export your graphics with a transparent background when possible and bring them into Clipchamp.

### Part 4: Get feedback with Copilot

1. Write a prompt for **Microsoft Copilot**. Example:  
   "I made a teaser for a [genre] song about [theme]. It has a [description of the style] look. What postproduction edits would make it feel more professional? Suggest ideas for pacing, visuals, and effects."

1. Apply **1–2 suggestions** from Copilot to improve your video.

1. Make any final changes using this feedback.

### Part 5: Export and share

1. Watch your final video and check that everything looks good.  
1. Export in at least 1080p quality.

Be ready to share and explain:
  - What edits and effects you added  
  - How AI tools helped improve your original version  
  - What change made the biggest difference  
  - How using AI compares to traditional editing
