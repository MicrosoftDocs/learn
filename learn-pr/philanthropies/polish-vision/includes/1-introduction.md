In this session, we explore how AI tools can level up your music video during postproduction. Using Microsoft Clipchamp, Designer, and Copilot, you learn how to improve footage, apply smart edits, and add dynamic visuals and transitions—all with help from AI. From fixing color and cleaning up audio to adding cool effects and getting real-time feedback, this session gives you what you need to take your video from a rough cut to a polished final version. Whether you're lining up your scenes with the music or adding the final touches, AI helps make your creative decisions faster and easier.

## Scenario

Now that your teaser is approved and production is done, it's time to bring everything together. You upload your clips into Clipchamp. Next you use Clipchamp's AI tools to find the best takes, add smooth transitions, and match the pace of the video with the beat of the song. You adjust the color, clean up background noise, and layer in subtle effects that make the video look and feel more professional.

To make the visuals even stronger, you open Microsoft Designer to create extra touches—like animated lyrics and scene titles—that boost the mood and message. You add these graphics into Clipchamp to give the final video a polished, intentional feel.

Copilot supports the process by giving you real-time editing tips. It helps you keep the style consistent, smooth out scene transitions, and even suggest alternate endings. When the artist joins a virtual review session, they give feedback while Copilot suggests edits on the fly. Everything comes together, and you export the final version—an AI-powered, creative music video that's ready to share.

Thanks to these AI tools, what used to take a lot of time and effort now feels faster, easier, and more creative.
