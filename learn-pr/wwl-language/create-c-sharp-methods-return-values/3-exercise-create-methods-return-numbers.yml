  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "What data type is returned from the following statement: `return 100 * 0.5;`"
    choices:
    - content: "An `int` type"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "`int` is incorrect. This line of code returns a `double`."
    - content: "A `decimal` type"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "`decimal` is incorrect. This line of code returns a `double`."
    - content: "A `double` type"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "`double` is correct. Since an integer literal is being multiplied by a double, this line of code returns a double."
  - content: "Which type of method doesn't need to include a `return` statement?"
    choices:
    - content: "`string` methods"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "`string` is incorrect. Methods that declare a `string` return type must use `return` to return a `string`."
    - content: "`void` methods"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "`void` is correct! `void` methods don't need to use a `return` statement."
    - content: "array methods"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That answer is incorrect. Methods that declare an array return type must use `return` to return an array."
