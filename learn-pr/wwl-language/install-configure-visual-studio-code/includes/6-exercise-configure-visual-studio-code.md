You can extend the capabilities of Visual Studio Code using extensions. The Visual Studio Code community has built hundreds of useful extensions available on the Visual Studio Code Marketplace.

## Configure Visual Studio Code Extensions

Now that you're familiar with the Visual Studio Code user interface, your next step is to configure Visual Studio Code for C# coding.

1. Ensure that you have Visual Studio Code open.

1. On the **Activity bar**, select **Extensions**.

1. In the **Search Extensions in Marketplace** textbox, enter **C#**

    Entering "C#" filters the list of extensions to show only the extensions that have something to do with C# coding.

1. In the filtered list of available extensions, select the extension labeled "**C# Dev Kit** - Official C# extension from Microsoft" that's published by Microsoft.

    There's lots of information about the C# extension that you could read. For now, the important thing to know is that this extension helps you to develop, edit, and debug C# code in Visual Studio Code. You can come back later to read about the extension if you want.

1. To install the extension, select **Install**.

    The Install button changes to Installing. This extension should install quickly.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Keep in mind that it's better to wait until you've determined that you actually need an extension before installing one. Like any Marketplace, many items perform similar functions and some items are quite specialized. You'll want to choose the extensions that provide the greatest benefit for the tasks that you need to complete rather than installing every extension that looks interesting.

1. Close the C# Dev Kit page in the Editor.

1. On the **EXTENSIONS** view, clear the text **C#** from the Search textbox.

    The **EXTENSIONS** view will refresh to show all of the **INSTALLED** extensions at the top of the list. Popular and recommended extensions are listed below the installed extensions.

1. Notice that installing the C# Dev Kit installs the following extensions:

    - **.NET Install Tool**. This extension installs and manages different versions of the .NET SDK and Runtime.
    - **C#**. This extension provides base language support for C#.
    - **C# Dev Kit** - The official C# extension from Microsoft.
    - **IntelliCode for C# Dev Kit**. This extension provides AI-assisted development for C# Dev Kit.

    These four extensions are the only ones that you need for now.

In the next unit, you create a C# code project in Visual Studio Code.
