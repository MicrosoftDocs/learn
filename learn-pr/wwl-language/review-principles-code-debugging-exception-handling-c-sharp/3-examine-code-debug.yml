  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "What is a debugger?"
    choices:
    - content: "A software tool used to observe and control the execution flow of a program."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. A debugger is a software tool uses an analytical approach to observe and control the execution flow of a program."
    - content: "A program that generates code automatically based on user input."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Debuggers are used isolate logic issues in an application. Debuggers are not used to generate code."
    - content: "A tool that helps developers write their code faster."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Although code debuggers speed the debugging process and help to identify issues, they do not help with writing code."
  - content: "What is the primary benefit of using a debugger?"
    choices:
    - content: "A debugger helps developers to write code faster."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A debugger is used to identify logic issues."
    - content: "A debugger enables developers to watch their application running and follow program execution one line of code at a time."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The primary benefit of using a debugger is watching application code run and following program execution one line of code at a time."
    - content: "A debugger helps developers to add new features to their application."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A debugger is used to identify logic issues."
  - content: "What is one of the most important features of a debugger?"
    choices:
    - content: "Code generation."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A debugger may help with the development process, but it doesn't help a developer to write the code."
    - content: "Observation of your program's state."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Observation of your program's state is one of the most important features that come with almost all debuggers."
    - content: "Automatic bug fixing."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A debugger doesn't automatically fix code bugs."
  - content: "What is the best way to find the root cause of a bug?"
    choices:
    - content: "Running your app with different data."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Running the application with different data can take a long time and there is no guarantee that the new data will expose the issue."
    - content: "Breadcrumbing a few `Console.WriteLine(\"here\")` messages in your code."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Adding `Console.WriteLine()` messages to your application takes more time than using a debugger and requires code clean-up. Breadcrumbing isn't a good approach."
    - content: "Using a debugger."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Using a debugger is the best way to find the root cause of a bug."
