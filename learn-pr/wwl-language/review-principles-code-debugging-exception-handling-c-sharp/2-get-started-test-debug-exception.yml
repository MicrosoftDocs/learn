    - content: "A process to isolate and fix issues in code logic."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Code debugging involves isolating and fixing logic issues in code."
    - content: "A process to verify that code builds and runs without errors."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Developers debug code that runs without errors. For example, code debugging is used to identify and fix logic issues."
  - content: "Who is responsible for software testing?"
    choices:
    - content: "Software developers."
      isCorrect: false

    - content: "Both developers and testers."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Software developers and testers share the responsibility for code testing."
  - content: "What happens if an exception isn't managed in code?"
    choices:
    - content: "The code continues to run without any issue."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The runtime will display an error message, and the application may be terminated."
    - content: "The application generates an error message and closes."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. If an exception isn't managed in code, the runtime will display an error message and the application may be terminated."
    - content: "The code syntax errors are displayed to the user."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Syntax errors are caught during the build process. Syntax errors won't result in a runtime exception."
