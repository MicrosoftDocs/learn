  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "What is code debugging?"
    choices:
    - content: "A process to identify code syntax errors during the build process."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Syntax issues are normally exposed by IntelliSense and corrected before running the application."
    - content: "A process to isolate and fix issues in code logic."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Code debugging involves isolating and fixing logic issues in code."
    - content: "A process to verify that code builds and runs without errors."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Developers debug code that runs without errors. For example, when the application includes logic issues."
  - content: "What is a debugger?"
    choices:
    - content: "A software tool used to observe and control the execution flow of a program."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. A debugger is a software tool uses an analytical approach to observe and control the execution flow of a program."
    - content: "A program that generates code automatically based on user input."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Debuggers are used isolate logic issues in an application. They are not used to generate code."
    - content: "A tool that helps developers write their code faster."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Although code debuggers speed the debugging process and help to identify issues, they do not help with writing code."
  - content: "What happens when execution of a C# application results in a system error?"
    choices:
    - content: "The program crashes and closes."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. An exception is thrown when a system error occurs. If the exception is caught and handled, execution continues normally."
    - content: "The .NET runtime creates and throws an exception."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The .NET runtime throws an exception when a C# application generates a system error."
    - content: "The error is silently ignored and the program continues to run."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The .NET runtime throws an exception and the application is shut down if the exception isn't caught."
  - content: "What is the purpose of catching an exception in C#?"
    choices:
    - content: "To ignore the errors that occur in a program."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Exceptions should be handled in code to correct error conditions if possible."
    - content: "To generate other exceptions in a program."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Exceptions can be thrown when an issue or error is detected, but the `catch` clause is not a tool for generating errors."
    - content: "To take corrective action when an error occurs in a program."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The purpose of catching an exception is to take corrective action when an error occurs."
  - content: "What is the relationship between the type of exception and the information it contains?"
    choices:
    - content: "The type of exception determines the information it contains."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The type of exception determines the information it contains."
    - content: "The type of exception and the information it contains are unrelated."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Properties of the exception object contain information related to the exception type."
    - content: "The information contained in an exception determines the type of exception."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The exception type determines what information the exception contains, not the other way around."
