Your goal was to learn about the code debugging and exception handling processes.

By examining the code debugging and exception handling processes, you learned about the tools and mechanisms that enable the processes to work. You learned what a code debugger does and the benefits provided by using a code debugger. You also learned about the relationship between errors and exceptions, and how exceptions are thrown and caught during code execution.

Without the conceptual knowledge that you've gained, you wouldn't be prepared to start using code debugging and exception handling in your C# applications.
