title: Guided project - Develop foreach and if-elseif-else structures to process array data in C#
summary: Gain experience developing a console app that implements arrays, foreach loops, and if statements to achieve app specifications.
abstract: |
  In this module, you'll practice how to:
  - Use Visual Studio Code to develop a C# console application that uses foreach loops to access array data.
  - Use if statements to evaluate conditions and create code branches.
prerequisites: |
  *   Experience using Visual Studio Code to develop, build, and run C# console applications that include console I/O and access the methods of .NET classes.
  *   Experience using if statements in C# to evaluate an expression and branch code accordingly.
  *   Experience using a foreach loop to access elements of array variables.
