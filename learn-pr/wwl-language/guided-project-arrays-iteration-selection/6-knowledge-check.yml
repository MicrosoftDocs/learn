  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "A developer writes an application that uses a `foreach` loop to iterate through an array containing 20 elements. After the application is complete, the developer learns that the array must be updated to include 40 elements. The application needs to examine all 40 array elements. Which of the following items describes the required code update?"
    choices:
    - content: "Create a second `foreach` loop that iterates through the additional items."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect.  This will cause the array elements to be processed twice."
    - content: "No changes are required to the `foreach` loop."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! A `foreach` loop will iterate through all of the elements in an array."
    - content: "Place the original `foreach` loop inside the code block of a second `foreach` loop that iterates twice."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This will cause the array elements to be processed twice."
  - content: "A developer is working on a nested `foreach` structure that iterates through all of an application's data arrays. The first array contains the names of locations where water samples were collected. The remaining arrays contain the test results for the samples collected from each named location. Which of the following statements about how the arrays should be processed is correct?"
    choices:
    - content: "Each of the arrays containing samples can be processed by the outer loop, the inner loop will be used to verify the location."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The outer `foreach` loop can only process one array, so it can't process each of the arrays containing samples."
    - content: "The order in which the arrays are processed doesn't matter since the application has to process all of the data."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The relationship between outer and inner `foreach` loops is critical. The application won't be able to process all of the array data that's described in this scenario if the nested `foreach` structure isn't established correctly."
    - content: "The outer loop must process the array containing locations, the inner loop must process the arrays containing samples."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! The outer loop will iterate through the locations. The code block of the outer loop will be used to select the samples array for each location, and then process the sample in the inner `foreach` loop."
