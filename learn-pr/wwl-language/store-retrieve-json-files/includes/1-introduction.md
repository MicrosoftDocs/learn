JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is a widely used, lightweight, and text-based data interchange format that's easy for humans and machines to read and write. It's extensively used for transmitting data between servers and web applications, and for storing and exchanging data across various applications. In the world of software development, understanding how to work with JSON data using programming languages like C# is crucial.

Imagine you're signed up to help a non-profit company with a software project. Before the project kicks off, you decide to update your programming skills by developing a banking app. To practice your JSON serialization and deserialization skills, you're going implement JSON file I/O in the app's Program.cs file and helper classes. You plan to work you way through some basic serialization and deserialization tasks and then finish up with more advanced tasks like storing and retrieving bank account objects.

The topics covered in this module include:

- Introduction to JavaScript Object Notation.
- Working with JSON data in C#: Serialization and deserialization using JsonSerializer class.
- Customizing JSON serialization in C#.
- Customizing deserialization behavior in C#.
- Managing serialization and deserialization of complex objects with JsonSerializerOptions and Data Transfer Objects.
- Serializing and deserializing JSON files in C#.

After completing this module, youâ€™ll be able to:

- Explain the basics of JSON syntax and its use in data interchange and storage.
- Use the `System.Text.Json` namespace in C# to work with JSON data.
- Serialize C# objects into JSON strings using the `JsonSerializer.Serialize` method and customize the serialization process.
- Deserialize JSON strings back into C# objects using the `JsonSerializer.Deserialize` method and customize the deserialization process.
- Use the `JsonSerializerOptions` class and Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) to manage the serialization and deserialization of complex objects.
