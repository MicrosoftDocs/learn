Your goal was to understand how code blocks impact access to variables and the actions required to ensure that variables are appropriately scoped, initialized, and accessible when needed within an application.

You explored the impact of declaring variables inside and outside the boundaries of a code block. You also examined the impact that variable initialization can have on accessibility, as well as how removing unnecessary code blocks can affect code readability.

Code that uses improperly scoped or initialized variables will produced runtime errors. Your ability to scope and initialize variables correctly will ensure a better user experience with your applications.
