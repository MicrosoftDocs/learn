  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "A developer writes some code that includes an `if` statement code block. They initialize one integer variable to a value of 5 above (outside) of the code block. They initialize a second integer variable to a value of 6 on the first line inside of the code block. The Boolean expression for the code block evaluates to `true` if the first integer variable has a value greater than 0. On the second line inside the code block, they assign the sum of the two values to the first variable. On the first line after the code block, they write code to display the value of the first integer. What is the result when the code statement used to display the first integer is executed?"
    choices:
    - content: "No error is generated and the integer value is displayed. The value displayed is the sum of the first and second integer."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! Since the first integer is initialized above the if statement code, it's still in-scope after the code block. Also, since both integers are in-scope and initialized with values inside the code block, the addition of the values executes correctly. Finally, even though the second integer doesn't exist outside of the code block, the first integer retains any changes to its value that occurred inside the code block."
    - content: "No error is generated and the integer value is displayed. The value displayed is the initialized value from above the code block."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The value is displayed as the sum of the two integers."
    - content: "An error is generated because the first variable isn't in-scope after the code block."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. No error is generated. The first variable was initialized above the code block and still is in-scope both inside and after the code block."
