    choices:
    - content: "`myArray[3]`."

      explanation: "Incorrect. Remember - indexes are zero-based."
    - content: "`myArray[2]`."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! Indexes are zero-based, so an index of two returns the third element in an array."
    - content: "`myArray{3}`."
      isCorrect: false

    choices:
    - content: "`int[] myArray = new int[3];`."

    - content: "`int[] myArray = new int[2];`."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Arrays indexes are zero based, but when declaring an array, specify the actual number of elements."
    - content: "`int myArray = new int[3];`."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Missing a set of square brackets after the initial type specification, `int`."
  - content: "Which of the following `foreach` statements is syntactically correct?"

    - content: "`foreach (int value of values)`."
      isCorrect: false

    - content: "`foreach (int value with values)`."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The `foreach` statement doesn't include an `with` keyword."
