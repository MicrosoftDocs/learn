The following code is one possible solution for the challenge from the previous unit.

```c#
string[] orderIDs = { "B123", "C234", "A345", "C15", "B177", "G3003", "C235", "B179" };

foreach (string orderID in orderIDs)
{
    if (orderID.StartsWith("B"))
    {
        Console.WriteLine(orderID);
    }
}
```

This code is merely "*one possible solution*" because a lot depends on how you decided to implement the logic. As long as you got the right results per the rules in the challenge, and you used an array and a foreach statement, then you did great!

If you succeeded, congratulations! Continue on to the knowledge check in the next unit.
