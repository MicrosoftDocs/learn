  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "What is an array?"
    choices:
    - content: "A string variable."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. An array isn't thought of as a string variable, although an array variable can hold a set of strings."
    - content: "A sequence of individual data elements accessible through a single variable name."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. An array data structure with a single name and multiple data locations."
    - content: "A .NET Class Library."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Although the Array class is a part of the .NET Class Library, it isn't a .NET Class Library itself."
  - content: "Which of these is a correct example of creating an array and initializing it?"
    choices:
    - content: "`string[] myarray = new string[3]; myarray = \"test1\"; myarray = \"test2\"; myarray = \"test3\";`."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Although the array `myarray` is declared correctly, the code statements used to assign values to the array elements are missing the array index locations."
    - content: "`string[] myarray = string[3]; myarray[0] = test1; myarray[1] = test2; myarray[2] = test3;`."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The `new` operator is missing from the statement used to declare the array."
    - content: "`int[] myarray = new int[3]; myarray[0] = 1; myarray[1] = 2; myarray[2] = 3;`."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! The array `myarray` is declared correctly and the code statements used to assign values to the array elements specify the array index locations."
