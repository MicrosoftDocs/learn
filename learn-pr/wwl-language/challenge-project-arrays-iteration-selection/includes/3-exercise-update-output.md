The Student Grading application is used to calculate and report student grades based on their graded exam and extra credit assignments. Your goal in this challenge is to update the code that generates a score report in accordance with the teacher's updated requirements.

## Specification

In this first challenge exercise, you need to instantiate the variables that are required for the updated score report, and then update the `Console.WriteLine()` statement that writes student grades to the console.

Your updated application must:

- use the existing arrays and array values for all student grade calculations.
- use the nested structure provided by the existing `foreach` and `if` statements.
- declare and initialize any other integer variables that are required for calculating sums.
- declare and initialize any other decimal variables that are required for calculations and/or score report values.

The format of the update score report is:

```Output
Student         Exam Score      Overall Grade   Extra Credit

Sophia          0               95.8    A       0 (0 pts)
Andrew          0               91.2    A-      0 (0 pts)
Emma            0               90.4    A-      0 (0 pts)
Logan           0               93      A       0 (0 pts)
```

> [!NOTE]
> Since this exercise does not include updating calculations, the score report will show `0` for the new fields as shown above.

## Check your work

To validate that your code satisfies the specified requirements for this exercise, complete the following steps:

1. Use Visual Studio Code to build and run your app.

1. Verify that your application creates the following output:

    ```Output
    Student         Exam Score      Overall Grade   Extra Credit

    Sophia          0               95.8    A       0 (0 pts)
    Andrew          0               91.2    A-      0 (0 pts)
    Emma            0               90.4    A-      0 (0 pts)
    Logan           0               93      A       0 (0 pts)
    ```
