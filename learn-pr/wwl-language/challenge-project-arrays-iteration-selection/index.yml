title: Challenge project - Develop foreach and if-elseif-else structures to process array data in C#
summary: Demonstrate your ability to update a console app that implements arrays, foreach loops, and if statements in response to a user requested feature update.
abstract: |
  In this module, you'll demonstrate your ability to:
  -   Revise a C# console application that uses nested foreach loops to access array data based on an updated feature specification.
  -   Update the variables and if statements in a C# console application to create the code branches and calculations required to satisfy an updated feature specification.
prerequisites: |
  -   Experience using Visual Studio Code to develop, build, and run C# console applications that include console I/O and access the methods of .NET classes.
  -   Experience using if statements in C# to evaluate an expression and branch code accordingly.
  -   Experience using a foreach loop to access elements of array variables.
