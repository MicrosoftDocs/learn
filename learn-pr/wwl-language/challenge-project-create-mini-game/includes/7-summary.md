Your goal was to demonstrate the ability to develop features of an application that achieve a design specification. You needed to decipher existing game code to make informed decisions to make modifications and additions to the code.

By creating new methods, adding optional parameters, and using existing code, you built a functional and fun mini-game!

Your ability to implement features of this mini-game application based on a design specification demonstrates your ability to create and call methods.
