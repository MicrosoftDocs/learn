This module is a guided project where you use Visual Studio Code to develop a Langston's Ant project. The project demonstrates how simple rules can create complex behaviors. In this project, you develop the functionality to save and load simulation states. Let's start by setting up your development environment!

## Project overview

 In this project, you apply what you learned about object serialization. The Langston's Ant project uses Visual Studio Code to simulate ants moving on a grid, inspired by Alan Turing's universal Turing machine. The ant follows rules: turn right on white squares, left on black ones, changing the square color with each move. This project demonstrates how simple rules lead to complex patterns. You modify the project to save and load simulation states using JSON formatting and serialization.

## Setup

Use the following steps to prepare for the Guided Project exercises:

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You must have .NET Framework 8.0 installed and a Github account to complete these steps.

1. Open Visual Studio Code.

    You can use the Windows Start menu (or equivalent resource for another OS) to open Visual Studio Code.

1. Under the Visual Studio Code **Start** section, select **Clone Git Repository**.

1. In the URL bar, enter `https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/MSLearn-Implement-JSON-Storage-and-Serialization-in-C-Sharp.git`

1. In the File Explorer, create a new folder in a location that is easy to find and remember, such as a folder in your Desktop.

1. Select the **Select as Repository Destination** button.

    You need to be signed in to GitHub to successfully clone the project.

1. Open the project in Visual Studio Code.

1. In Explorer, expand the **M03-Guided-Project** folder.

1. Expand the **Langstons-Ant** folder.

1. Expand the **WPF** folder.

    You should see a collection of files and folders for the Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) application.

1. Right-click the **WPF** folder and click **Open in Integrated Terminal**.

> [!NOTE] 
> If you get stuck during any of the exercises, the solution for this module is available in the **Solution** folder of the guided project repository.

You're now ready to begin the Guided Project exercises. Good luck!
