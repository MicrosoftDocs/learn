Langston's Ant is a simulation of an ant walking along a grid. The ant follows a set of simple rules: it turns right if it's on a white square, and left if it's on a black square. Each time the ant moves to a new square, the square color changes from either black to white, or white to black. As the ant continues moving, it creates a pattern that slowly becomes more complex and interesting to observe. This simulation demonstrates how simple rules can create complex behaviors.

Suppose you want to see different branches of a particular simulation state. To explore the many different simulation possibilities, you may want to save and load simulation states. This module guides you through the steps to modify a Langston's Ant simulation to save and load game states. You'll add code to use JSON formatting and serialization to handle the states. By the end of this module, your project will save and load states of the simulation.
