  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "What is the primary job of the compiler?"
    choices:
    - content: "The compiler primarily locates spelling mistakes in your code."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "While it's possible you misspelled something in your code and that produces an error, that isn't the primary job of the compiler."
    - content: "The compiler primarily reformats your code."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The compiler will never reformat your code."
    - content: "The compiler primarily executes your code."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The compiler doesn't execute your code, but makes it possible for your code to be executed."
    - content: "The compiler primarily converts your code into an executable format that the computer can understand."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct!"
  - content: "Which of the following statements is **true** about C#."
    choices:
    - content: "C# is case *insensitive*."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Actually, C# is case-sensitive."
    - content: "`Console` is a method, and `WriteLine()` is a class."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Actually, the reverse is true.  `Console` is a class.  `WriteLine()` is a method."
    - content: "You use double-quotation marks to create a literal string."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct!"
    - content: "If you make a mistake when writing code, you have to delete it all and start over."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Actually, one of the great things about software development.  If you make a mistake, you can fix it and no one has to know."
  - content: 'What is **wrong** with this line of code?  `Console.WriteLine("What is wrong with me?")`'
    choices:
    - content: "The `L` in `WriteLine` should be lower-case."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The `L` should be upper case."
    - content: "It's missing a semi-colon at the end"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct!  The semi-colon must be used at the end of a code statement."
    - content: "The string should use single-quotes."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "A string literal must be surrounded in double-quotes.  A char literal is surrounded in single quotes."
    - content: "A comma should be used instead of a dot between `Console` and `WriteLine`."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The dot is the member access operator and allows you to access the methods of a class."
