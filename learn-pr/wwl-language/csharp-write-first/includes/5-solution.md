The following code is one possible solution for the challenge from the previous unit.

```csharp
Console.WriteLine("This is the first line.");

Console.Write("This is ");
Console.Write("the second ");
Console.Write("line.");
```

This code is just *one possible solution*, among many possible ways to achieve the same result. However, you should have used both the <xref:System.Console.WriteLine?displayProperty=nameWithType> and <xref:System.Console.Write?displayProperty=nameWithType> methods to produce the desired output.

```Output
This is the first line.
This is the second line.
```

If you were successful, congratulations! Continue to the next unit for a knowledge check.
