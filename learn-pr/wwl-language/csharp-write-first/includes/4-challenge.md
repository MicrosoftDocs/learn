Code challenges throughout these modules will reinforce what you've learned and help you gain some confidence before continuing on.

### Challenge: Write code in the .NET Editor to display two messages

1. Select all of the code in the .NET Editor, and press <kbd>Delete</kbd> or <kbd>Backspace</kbd> to delete it.

1. Write code that produces the following output:

    ```Output
    This is the first line.
    This is the second line.
    ```

    In the previous unit, you learned how to display a message in just one line of code, and you learned how to display a message using multiple lines of code. Use both techniques for this challenge. It doesn't matter which technique you apply to which line, and it doesn't matter how many ways you split one of the messages into multiple lines of code. That's your choice.

    No matter how you do it, your code should produce the specified output.

Whether you get stuck and need to peek at the solution or you finish successfully, continue to the next unit to view a solution to this challenge.
