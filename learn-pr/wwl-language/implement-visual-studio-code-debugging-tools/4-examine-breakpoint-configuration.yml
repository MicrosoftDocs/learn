  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "Which of the following options can be used set a breakpoint in Visual Studio Code?"
    choices:
    - content: "Left-click in the column to the left of a line number in the code editor."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. A breakpoint can be set by positioning the mouse pointer in the column to the left of a line number and then left-clicking."
    - content: "Select **Toggle Breakpoint** on the **Edit** menu."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The option to toggle breakpoints is on the **Run** menu, not the **Edit** menu."
    - content: "Right-click in the middle of a line of code, and then select **Toggle Breakpoint**."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Right-clicking in the middle of a line of code displays a context menu, but there is no **Toggle Breakpoint** option provided."
  - content: "How can a developer disable a breakpoint in Visual Studio Code?"
    choices:
    - content: "Click **Remove Breakpoint** on the **Run** menu."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The **Remove Breakpoint** option removes the breakpoint rather than disabling it."
    - content: "Right-click the red dot to the left of the line number and select **Disable Breakpoint**."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. A breakpoint can be disabled by right-clicking the red dot that represents a breakpoint and then selecting **Disable Breakpoint**."
    - content: "Left-click the red dot to the left of the line number."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Left-clicking the red dot that represents a breakpoint will delete the breakpoint."
  - content: "What happens when a developer disables a breakpoint in Visual Studio Code?"
    choices:
    - content: "The breakpoint is removed from the code entirely."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A disabled breakpoint remains in the configuration and can be reenabled."
    - content: "The breakpoint is skipped over during debugging."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. When a breakpoint is disabled, it is skipped over during debugging. In the user interface, the red dot representing the breakpoint is changed to a grey dot."
    - content: "The breakpoint will only be triggered if dot to the left of the line number is changed to a grey dot."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A grey dot to the left of the line number is used to represent a disabled breakpoint. When a breakpoint is disabled, it won't be triggered."
  - content: "What is a conditional breakpoint in Visual Studio Code?"
    choices:
    - content: "A breakpoint that only triggers when a specified condition is met."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. A conditional breakpoint is a special type of breakpoint that only triggers when a specified condition is met."
    - content: "A breakpoint that is triggered every time the code is run."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A conditional breakpoint will only be triggered when a specified condition is met."
    - content: "A breakpoint that is only visible in the editor and doesn't affect debugging."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A conditional breakpoint affects debugging and pauses execution when the condition is met."
  - content: "How can a developer create a conditional breakpoint in Visual Studio Code?"
    choices:
    - content: "Left-click in the column to the left of a line number in the code editor."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A left-click in the column to the left of a line number sets a standard breakpoint."
    - content: "Select **Toggle Conditional Breakpoint** on the **Run** menu."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The **Run** menu doesn't include a **Toggle Conditional Breakpoint** option. The **Run** menu does include a **New Breakpoint** option that displays a submenu. The submenu includes a **Conditional Breakpoint** option."
    - content: "Right-click in the column to the left of a line number, and then select **Add Conditional Breakpoint**."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. A developer can create a conditional breakpoint by right-clicking in the column to the left of a line number, and then selecting **Add Conditional Breakpoint**."
