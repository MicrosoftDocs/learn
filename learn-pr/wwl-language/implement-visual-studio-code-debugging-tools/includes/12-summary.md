Your goal was to gain experience debugging C# applications with Visual Studio Code.

By configuring the Visual Studio Code debugger environment for different sample application scenarios, you gained experience with nearly every aspect of the debugger interface. You used breakpoints and conditional breakpoints to pause execution at critical locations within your code. While execution was paused, you used the VARIABLES, WATCH, and CALL STACK sections of the RUN AND DEBUG view to evaluate the state of variables, expressions, and the overall application. You also used the execution controls on the **Debug toolbar** step through and over code lines while your application is running. You even used the launch.json file to configure which console to use and to configure the debug environment for projects that include more than one executable.

Without the ability to configure and use the Visual Studio Code debugger tools, you wouldn't be able to isolate and fix code bugs in a timely manner.
