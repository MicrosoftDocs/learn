    - content: "It returns the names of subdirectories within the specified directory."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Returning subdirectories is the behavior of `Directory.GetDirectories`, not `Directory.GetFiles`."
    - content: "It returns the names of files within the specified directory."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. `Directory.GetFiles` returns an array of full file names including paths."
  - content: "What is the purpose of the `StreamReader` and `StreamWriter` classes in C#?"
    choices:
    - content: "They're used to establish network connections for data transmission."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. `StreamReader` and `StreamWriter` are used for handling text data in streams, not for establishing network connections."
    - content: "They're used to read and write binary data from and to a stream."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. `StreamReader` and `StreamWriter` are designed for reading and writing text data, not binary data."
    - content: "They're used to read characters from a byte stream and write characters to a stream in a specific encoding."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The `StreamReader` class is used to read characters from a byte stream in a particular encoding, while the `StreamWriter` class is used to write characters to a stream in a specific encoding."
  - content: "What is the purpose of the `FileStream.Seek` method in C#?"
    choices:
    - content: "It's used to write to a file."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The `FileStream.Seek` method doesn't write to a file."
    - content: "It's used to change the current position of the `FileStream` object."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The `FileStream.Seek` method changes the current position of the `FileStream` object."
    - content: "It's used to close a file."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The `FileStream.Seek` method doesn't close a file."
  - content: "What are some common use cases for the `BinaryReader` and `BinaryWriter` classes in .NET?"
    choices:
    - content: "They're used for creating and managing databases."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While they can handle data, `BinaryReader` and `BinaryWriter` aren't designed for database management."
    - content: "They're used for handling binary data such as configuration and multimedia files."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. `BinaryReader` and `BinaryWriter` are designed for reading and writing binary data, which includes configuration and multimedia files."
    - content: "They're used for reading and writing text files."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. `BinaryReader` and `BinaryWriter` aren't typically used for text files."
  - content: "What classes are used to create and manage directories and files in a C# app?"
    choices:
    - content: "`BinaryWriter` and `BinaryReader` classes."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. These classes are used for creating and reading binary files."
    - content: "`Path`, `Directory`, and `File` classes."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The Path, Directory, and File classes are used to create and manage directories and files."
    - content: "`StreamWriter`, `StreamReader`, and `FileStream` classes."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. These classes are used for reading and writing CSV files and performing low-level file input and output operations."
