In this module, you learned about text file input and output in a C# application using the `System.IO` namespace. You explored how to create, read, write, and delete files using the `File`, `Directory`, and `Path` classes. You learned how to store and retrieve structured data using comma-separated values (CSV) files and the `StreamReader` and `StreamWriter` classes. You also learned about the `FileStream` class, and how read and write binary files using the `BinaryReader` and `BinaryWriter` classes.

The main takeaways from this module include using the `Path`, `Directory`, and `File` classes to work with files and directories, as well as the `StreamReader` and `StreamWriter` classes for reading from and writing to text files. You learned how to control file access in a more granular way using the `FileStream` class, and how to read and write binary files using the `BinaryReader` and `BinaryWriter` classes.
