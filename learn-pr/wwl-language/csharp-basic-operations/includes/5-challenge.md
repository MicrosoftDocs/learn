In this challenge, you'll write code that will use a formula to convert a temperature from degrees Fahrenheit to Celsius. You'll print the result in a formatted message to the user.

### Challenge: Calculate Celsius given the current temperature in Fahrenheit

1. Select all of the code in the .NET Editor, and press <kbd>Delete</kbd> or <kbd>Backspace</kbd> to delete it.

1. Enter the following code in the .NET Editor:

    ```csharp
    int fahrenheit = 94;
    ```

1. To convert temperatures in degrees Fahrenheit to Celsius, first subtract 32, then multiply by five ninths (5 / 9).

1. Display the result of the temperature conversion in a formatted message

    Combine the variables with literal strings passed into a series of `Console.WriteLine()` commands to form the complete message.

1. When you're finished, the message should resemble the following output:

    ```Output
    The temperature is 34.444444444444444444444444447 Celsius.
    ```

> [!NOTE]
> Admittedly, it is preferred to not see so many values after the decimal point. Ideally the value would be formatted to a single value after the decimal point: `34.4`.
