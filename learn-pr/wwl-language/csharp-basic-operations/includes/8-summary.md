Your goal was to perform basic operations on string and numeric data. As a coding challenge, you converted a value from one unit of measure (Fahrenheit) to another (Celsius) and displayed the result in a formatted message.

You used various operators to perform basic string and mathematical operations. You learned how some symbols are reused (overloaded) as different operators, depending on the context. You learned how the data types of the operands influence the meaning of the operators. Finally, you learned how to change the data type of a value using the cast operator.
