  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "Which of the following lines of code will fail to output the text `Windows 11`?"
    choices:
    - content: "`Console.WriteLine(\"Windows \" + 7 + 4);`"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct!"
    - content: "`Console.WriteLine(\"Windows \" + 11);`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This line correctly concatenates 11 to the string"
    - content: "`Console.Write(\"Windows \" + 1 + 1);`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This line implicitly casts"
  - content: "What is the value of the following result? `int result = 3 + 1 * 5 / 2;`"
    choices:
    - content: "10"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. C# follows the same order as PEMDAS."
    - content: "5"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct."
    - content: "6"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. C# follows the same order as PEMDAS."
  - content: "What will be the result of the following line of code?  `Console.WriteLine(5 / 10);`"
    choices:
    - content: "0.5"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While 5 / 10 does equal 0.5, since `int` literals are used, C# will represent them differently."
    - content: "0"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Correct!"
    - content: "1"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Since `5` and `10` are `int` literals, dividing them would normally equal `0.5`, however, the `.5`` would be truncated."
  - content: "Which of the following lines of code uses the *addition assignment* operator?"
    choices:
    - content: "`value += 5;`"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Correct!"
    - content: "`value++;`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This line of code doesn't use the addition assignment operator."
    - content: "value = value + 5;"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This line of code doesn't use the *addition assignment* operator."
