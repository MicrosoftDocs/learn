Your goal was to demonstrate the ability to use the Visual Studio Code debugger tools for C# applications.

By configuring the debug environment and successfully debugging the cash register application, you demonstrated your ability to use the Visual Studio Code debugger tools for C#. You began by ensuring that the launch.json file was configured correctly to support your application. Then you ran the application, reviewed the generated output, and identified the logic issue. After that you used the Visual Studio Code debugger tools to isolate and fix the logic issues. When you were fished, you saved your updated application and ran the application to demonstrate that the application performed as intended.
