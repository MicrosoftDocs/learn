title: Implement asynchronous tasks
summary: Learn how to implement asynchronous tasks in C# apps using the `async` and `await` keywords and how to run asynchronous tasks in parallel.
abstract: |
  -   Implement asynchronous programming in C# using the `async` and `await` keywords.

  -   Perform asynchronous file input and output operations and access web resources asynchronously in C#.

  -   Use the Task Parallel Library (TPL) in C# for parallel programming and managing concurrent data structures.

  -   Identify common pitfalls in parallel programming and handle exceptions in async and parallel tasks.

  -   Implement data parallelism in a C# application as part of a hands-on exercise.
prerequisites: |
  -   An installation of Visual Studio Code with the C# Dev Kit extension installed.

  -   The ability to develop object-oriented programs in C# that implement classes, interfaces, class inheritance, and polymorphic behavior.

  -   The ability to manage collections, structs, records, generics, dates and times, and anonymous types.

  -   A basic understanding of file input and output operations using the System.IO classes.

  -   A basic understanding of JSON serialization and deserialization using System.Text.Json classes and Data Transfer Objects.
