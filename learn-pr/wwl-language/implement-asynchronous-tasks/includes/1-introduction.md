Asynchronous and parallel programming are powerful techniques that can enhance the performance and responsiveness of your applications. In C#, these techniques are made simpler and more accessible through the use of keywords like `async` and `await`, and libraries like the Task Parallel Library (TPL).

Imagine you're signed up to help a non-profit company with a software project. Before the project kicks off, you decide to update your programming skills by developing a banking app. To practice your asynchronous programming skills, you're going implement asynchronous versions of helper classes that implement file backup and restore processes.

The topics covered in this module include:

- Introduction to asynchronous programming in C#.
- Implementing asynchronous file input and output in C#.
- Asynchronous access to web resources using `HttpClient` in C#.
- Implementing parallel programming and asynchronous tasks in C#.
- Managing and handling exceptions in asynchronous and parallel tasks in C#.
- Implementing data parallelism in C# using `Parallel.ForEachAsync` and `Task.WhenAll`.

After completing this module, youâ€™ll be able to:

- Implement asynchronous programming in C# using the `async` and `await` keywords.
- Perform asynchronous file input and output operations and access web resources asynchronously in C#.
- Use the Task Parallel Library (TPL) in C# for parallel programming and managing concurrent data structures.
- Identify common pitfalls in parallel programming and handle exceptions in async and parallel tasks.
- Implement data parallelism in a C# application as part of a hands-on exercise.
