Your goal was to use the `do-while` and `while` statements to perform iterations. The `do-while` and `while` statements are unique because the body of the code block determines whether the flow of execution should continue or stop.

Using the `do-while` statement, you executed a block of code once before evaluating a Boolean expression and potentially exiting the iteration. Using the `while` statement, you performed the evaluation of the Boolean expression immediately, and continued to evaluate it to exit the iteration. You used the `continue` statement within the code block to step directly to the Boolean expression.

You developed a practical application that uses the `do-while` and `continue` statements to simulate a battle in a role playing game. Real-world scenarios involving the `do-while` and `while` iteration statements involve working with streams of data from files, from the internet, or any other scenario where you'll continue to perform an iteration until a condition is met.

Without `do-while` and `while` iteration statements, it would be difficult to write and maintain iteration code that sets the exit condition within the iteration code block.
