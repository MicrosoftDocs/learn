title: Add looping logic to your code using the do-while and while statements in C#
summary: Use the do-while and while statements to iterate as long as a Boolean expression evaluates to true.
abstract: |
  After you complete this module, you'll be able to:
  - Write code that uses the do-while statement to iterate through a code block
  - Write code that uses the while statement to iterate through a code block
  - Use the continue statement to step directly to the Boolean evaluation
prerequisites: |
  *   Experience using Visual Studio Code to develop, build, and run C# console applications that include console I/O and access the methods of .NET classes
  *   Experience using C# code to evaluate conditional expressions and manage variable scope inside and outside of code blocks
  *   Experience using if-elseif-else and switch-case statements in C# to match a variable or expression against several possible outcomes
  *   Experience using foreach and for statements in C# to loop through a block of code and access elements of array variables
