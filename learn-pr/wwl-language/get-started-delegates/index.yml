title: Get started with delegates
summary: Learn how to declare, instantiate, and invoke delegates for scenarios that require dynamic method invocation, such as callback methods and custom sorting or filtering.&nbsp;
abstract: |
  -   Explain the concept of delegates in C# and their benefits in terms of flexibility, extensibility, and decoupling.

  -   Describe how to declare, instantiate, and invoke delegates using various methods, including named methods, anonymous methods, and lambda expressions.

  -   Explain how delegates are used in sorting, callback, and other real-world scenarios.

  -   Describe how strongly typed delegates like `Action` and `Func` simplify your code and improve readability.

  -   Explain how variance in C# enhances flexibility in method signatures with delegates.

  -   Implement delegates in a C# application.
prerequisites: |
  -   An installation of Visual Studio Code with the C# Dev Kit extension installed.

  -   The ability to develop object-oriented programs in C# that implement classes, interfaces, class inheritance, and polymorphic behavior.

  -   The ability to manage collections, structs, records, generics, dates and times, and anonymous types.

  -   A basic understanding of file IO, JSON serialization, and asynchronous programming.
