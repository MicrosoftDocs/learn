Your goal was to gain experience with the Visual Studio Code debugger, implement a `try-catch` pattern, and create and throw exceptions that are caught at a lower level of the call stack.

By reviewing the cash register application, debugging the `MakeChange` method, and implementing exception handling techniques in both the method and calling code, you gained the experience you wanted. You used the debugger tools to configure a breakpoint in the top-level statements of the application. With execution paused, you stepped through the code to isolate an issue in the code logic. You implemented a `try-catch` pattern in the top-level statements, created and threw an `InvalidOperationException` exception in the `MakeChange` method, and then updated the `catch` clause to catch only the `InvalidOperationException` exception type.

The ability to debug C# applications and implement exception handling enables you to develop stable and reliable applications.
