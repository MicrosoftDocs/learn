  questions:
  - content: "What is the purpose of catching an exception in C#?"
    choices:
    - content: "To ignore the errors that occur in a program."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Exceptions should be handled in code to correct error conditions if possible."
    - content: "To generate other exceptions in a program."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Exceptions can be thrown when an issue or error is detected, but the `catch` clause isn't a tool for generating errors."
    - content: "To take corrective action when an error occurs in a program."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The purpose of catching an exception is to take corrective action when an error occurs."
  - content: "What is the relationship between the type of exception and the information it contains?"
    choices:
    - content: "The type of exception and the information it contains are unrelated."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Properties of the exception object contain information related to the exception type."
    - content: "The type of exception determines the information it contains."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The type of exception determines the information it contains."
    - content: "The information contained in an exception determines the type of exception."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The exception type determines what information the exception contains, not the other way around."
  - content: "What is a conditional breakpoint in Visual Studio Code?"
    choices:
    - content: "A breakpoint that only triggers when a specified condition is met."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. A conditional breakpoint is a special type of breakpoint that only triggers when a specified condition is met."
    - content: "A breakpoint that is triggered every time the code is run."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A conditional breakpoint is triggered when a specified condition is met."
    - content: "A breakpoint that is only visible in the editor and doesn't affect debugging."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A conditional breakpoint affects debugging and pauses execution when the condition is met."
  - content: "When is an `ArgumentOutOfRangeException` exception thrown?"
    choices:
    - content: "An `ArgumentOutOfRangeException` exception is thrown when an attempt is made to index an array outside the bounds of the array."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This answer choice describes when an `IndexOutOfRangeException` exception is thrown."
    - content: "An `ArgumentOutOfRangeException` exception is thrown when the value of an argument is outside the allowable range of values as defined by the method."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. An `ArgumentOutOfRangeException` exception should only be thrown when the value of an argument is outside the allowable range of values as defined by the invoked method."
    - content: "An `ArgumentOutOfRangeException` exception is thrown when an attempt is made to store a value of one type in an array of another type."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This answer choice describes when a `ArrayTypeMismatchException` exception is thrown."
  - content: "What is the recommended approach for catching exceptions in C#?"
    choices:
    - content: "Catch any type of exception without specifying an object argument."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Catching any type of exception without specifying an object argument isn't recommended."
    - content: "Catch only the exceptions that your code knows how to recover from."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The recommended approach is to catch only the exceptions that your code knows how to recover from."
    - content: "Catch only the exceptions that aren't derived from System.Exception."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. All exceptions in C# are derived from System.Exception."
