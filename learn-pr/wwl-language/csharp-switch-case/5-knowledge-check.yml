  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "What is the purpose of a `default` case in a switch statement?"
    choices:
    - content: "It's used to specify the condition for the switch statement."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The default case is not used to specify the condition for the switch statement."
    - content: "It's used to end the switch statement."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The default case doesn't end the switch statement."
    - content: "It's used to execute a block of code if no case matches the expression."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! The default case executes when no other case matches the switch expression."
  - content: "What happens if a break statement (or alternative keyword that prevents \"fall-through\") is omitted in a switch case?"
    choices:
    - content: "The `default` case will execute."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The default case won't execute if a break statement is omitted."
    - content: "The impacted case sections will be removed by the compiler."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The compiler doesn't remove case sections that allow “fall through” to the next switch section."
    - content: "The compiler will generate an error."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! Only one switch section is allowed to be executed. If you forget the `break` keyword (or, optionally, the `return` keyword) the compiler will generate an error."
