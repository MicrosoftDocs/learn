summary: Learn how to add branching logic that matches one variable or expression against many possible values.
abstract: |
  After you complete this module, you'll be able to:
  - Use the switch-case construct to match a variable or expression against several possible outcomes
  - Convert code that uses an if-elseif-else construct into a switch-case construct
prerequisites: |
