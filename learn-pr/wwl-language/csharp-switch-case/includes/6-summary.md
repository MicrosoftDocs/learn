Your goal was to add branching logic that matches one variable or expression against many possible values.

Using the `switch-case` construct, you matched an employee's numeric level with their title. You used the `switch-case` as a replacement for the `if-elseif-else` construct to more succinctly express your intent of converting a Stock Keeping Unit (SKU) into a long-form description.

C# developers use `if` and `switch` selection statements, along with conditional operators, to branch their code. The experience you've gained using selection statements enables you to choose the best C# tool for expressing your intent in your code.
