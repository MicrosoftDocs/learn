  title: "Knowledge check"
  questions:
  - content: "A developer writes the code to implement a `switch-case` construct. What is the purpose of the `break` keyword?"
    choices:
    - content: "The `break` keyword tells the runtime to continue evaluating other cases in the `switch` construct."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The `break` keyword doesn't instruct the runtime to continue evaluating other cases in the `switch` construct."
    - content: "The `break` keyword tells the runtime to stop evaluating case patterns and prevents execution of other cases in the `switch` construct."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! The `break` keyword redirects code execution and prevents one switch section continuing into the next section."
    - content: "The `break` keyword tells the runtime to exit the application."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The `break` keyword doesn't instruct the runtime to exit the application."
  - content: "A developer writes the code to implement a `switch-case` construct that evaluates a variable against many possible matching values. They include the `default` keyword as part of their `switch-case` construct. What is the purpose of the `default` keyword?"
    choices:
    - content: "The `default` keyword supplies the default value for the variable if the variable hasn't been initialized."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The `default` keyword doesn't supply a default value for the variable being evaluated. An error will be generated if the variable hasn't been initialized."
    - content: "The `default` keyword acts as the matching value when none of the supplied `case` values is a match."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. If there's no matching `case` value labels, the optional `default` label is used as the matching value."
    - content: "The `default` keyword supplies a default actions code block that is always executed regardless of the matching case value"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The `default` keyword doesn't supply a code block that is always executed."
  - content: "Which of the following statements about the `switch-case` construct is true?"
    choices:
    - content: "A single switch section can have multiple case labels."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct!"
    - content: "A switch construct must include a default switch section."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The default switch section is optional."
    - content: "The colon at the end of the case label is optional."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The colon isn't optional."
