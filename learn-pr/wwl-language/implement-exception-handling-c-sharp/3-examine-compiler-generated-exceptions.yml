  questions:
  - content: "When is an `ArrayTypeMismatchException` exception thrown?"
    choices:
    - content: "An `ArrayTypeMismatchException` exception is thrown when an attempt is made to divide an integral value by zero."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This answer choice describes when a `DivideByZeroException` exception is thrown."
    - content: "An `ArrayTypeMismatchException` exception is thrown when an attempt is made to index an array outside the bounds of the array."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This answer choice describes when a `IndexOutOfRangeException` exception is thrown."
    - content: "An `ArrayTypeMismatchException` exception is thrown when an attempt is made to store a value of one type in an array of another type."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The `ArrayTypeMismatchException` exception is thrown when an attempt is made to store an element of the wrong type within an array."
  - content: "When is a `DivideByZeroException` exception thrown?"
