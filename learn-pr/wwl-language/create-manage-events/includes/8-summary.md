In this module, you learned the fundamentals of events in C#, including their reliance on delegates and their role in enabling communication between objects.

After completing this module, you're now able to:

- Understand the concept of events in C# and their reliance on delegates.  
- Declare and use events with standard or custom delegates.  
- Encapsulate events to control access and ensure proper propagation in derived classes.  
- Subscribe to and unsubscribe from events programmatically to manage resources effectively.  
- Apply modern .NET Core practices for event handling, including the use of `EventHandler` and custom `EventArgs` classes.  

Now that you have a basic understanding of events, consider reviewing the following resources:

- [Events (C# Programming Guide)](/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/events/)  
- [Delegates (C# Programming Guide)](/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/delegates)  
- [Event Handling in .NET](/dotnet/standard/events/)
