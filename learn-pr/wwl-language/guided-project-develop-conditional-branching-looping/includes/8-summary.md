Your goal was to build an application that implements a combination of selection and iteration statements to achieve the design goals of your application.

By creating nested combinations of iteration and selection statements, you built a user interface that enables the user to display pet data from the ourAnimals array. You also developed the features to enter and validate characteristics of new pets and add them to the ourAnimals array. The app user can continue making menu selections until they choose to exit the application.

Having the ability to implement a variety of iteration and selection statements enables you to optimize your code.
