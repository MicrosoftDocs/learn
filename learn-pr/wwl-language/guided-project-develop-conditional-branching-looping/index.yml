title: Guided project - Develop conditional branching and looping structures in C#
summary: Gain experience developing a console app that implements selection and iteration statements to achieve app specifications.
abstract: |
  In this module, you'll practice how to:
  *   Use Visual Studio Code to develop a C# console application that uses a combination of selection and iteration statements to implement logical workflows in accordance with supplied application data and user interactions.
  *   Evaluate the underlying conditions and make an informed decision when choosing between if-elseif-else and switch statements, and between foreach, for, while, and do iteration statements.
  *   Scope variables at an appropriate level within an application.
prerequisites: |
  *   Experience using Visual Studio Code to develop, build, and run C# console applications that include console I/O and access the methods of .NET classes
  *   Experience using C# code to evaluate conditional expressions and manage variable scope inside and outside of code blocks
  *   Experience using if-elseif-else and switch-case statements in C# to match a variable or expression against several possible outcomes
  *   Experience using foreach, for, do, and while statements in C# to loop through a block of code and access elements of array variables
