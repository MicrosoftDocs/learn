  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "When is it appropriate to use a `switch-case` construct rather than a `if-elseif-else` construct?"
    choices:
    - content: "A `switch-case` construct is appropriate when more than 2-3 `else if` code blocks are required."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! When more than 2-3 `else if` code blocks are required, the code can become difficult to read, and the `switch-case` construct is preferable"
    - content: "A `switch-case` construct is appropriate when the number of `case` patterns is small."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. If fewer than 2-3 `case` patterns are included in the selection list of a `switch` statement, an `if-elseif-else` construct may be the better choice."
    - content: "A `switch-case` construct is appropriate when the selection statement is inside a loop."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Being inside a loop doesn't affect the choice between a `switch-case` construct and a `if-elseif-else` construct."
  - content: "Why should a developer choose a `for` statement rather than a `foreach` statement when processing the contents of a multidimensional array?"
    choices:
    - content: "`for` statements do a better job of examining each array item separately."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A `foreach` statement processes each array item separately."
    - content: "`foreach` statements do a better job of examining each array item separately."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. It's true that a `foreach` statement processes each array item separately. However, that is a reason to choose a `foreach` statement, not a reason to choose a `for` statement."
    - content: "`for` statements enable a developer to treat array dimensions separately."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! When their code is processing the contents of a multidimensional array, a developer often wants to iterate through the array dimensions separately. The `for` statement provides better support for processing array dimensions separately."
  - content: "Why is it important to scope a variable at its lowest necessary level?"
    choices:
    - content: "It ensures that a variable that's declared outside of a code block, can be accessed inside the code block before it's been assigned a value."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A variable that's declared outside a code block must be assigned a value before it can be accessed inside the code block. If the variable hasn't been initialized a build error occurs."
    - content: "It ensures that application resources and the security footprint are kept small."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Keeping variables scoped at the lowest necessary level enables better resource management and helps to minimize the attack profile of the application."
    - content: "It ensures that a variable can be accessed within the lowest level code branches of an application."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Scoping a variable at its lowest necessary level doesn't ensure the variable is accessible within all low level code branches of an application."
