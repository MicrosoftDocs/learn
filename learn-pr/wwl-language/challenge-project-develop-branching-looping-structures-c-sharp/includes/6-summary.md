Your goal was to demonstrate the ability to develop features of an application that achieve a design specification. You needed to choose and implement the appropriate iteration and selection statement types to meet the stated requirements.

By creating nested combinations of iteration and selection statements, you built a user interface that enables the application user to enter valid pet data that filled gaps in the ourAnimals array.

Your ability to implement features of the Contoso Pets application based on a design specification demonstrates your understanding of the iteration and selection statements.
