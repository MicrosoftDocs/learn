  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "A developer is writing an application in Visual Studio Code. They save changes to their Program.cs file, and then run the `dotnet build` command in the Terminal panel. What information can they find in reported Error and Warning messages?"
    choices:
    - content: "One or more suggestions for how to fix any syntax issues detected."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Error and Warning messages don't include suggested fixes."
    - content: "The line number and information about what caused the error."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Error and Warning messages include a description of the issue and the line number where it occurs."
    - content: "Links to help documentation."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Error and Warning messages don't include links to documentation."
  - content: "A developer needs to create an iteration statement. Under what condition is a `while` statement a better choice than a `do` statement?"
    choices:
    - content: "When the expression values evaluated by the iteration statement are unknown prior to the iteration code block."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A `do` statement would work well in this situation."
    - content: "When the expression values evaluated by the iteration statement are known prior to the iteration code block."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. When the code is able to evaluate the loop expression prior to the loop, a `while` statement allows the code to implement zero iterations."
    - content: "When the developer creates nested `do` or `while` loops."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Nesting loops isn't a factor in this decision."
