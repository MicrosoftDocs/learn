  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "Which of the following variable names should or must be **avoided**?"
    choices:
    - content: "$DATA"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The `$` can't be used in a variable name. Furthermore, you shouldn't use all uppercase characters for a variable name."
    - content: "registrationComplete"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. `registrationComplete` is a valid variable name."
    - content: "flag"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. `flag` is a valid variable name."
  - content: "What is the problem with this line of code: `var message;`"
    choices:
    - content: "`var` isn't a data type."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. It's true that `var` isn't a data type, but that's not the problem with this code."
    - content: "Use of `var` keyword without initializing the variable"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct!"
    - content: "A variable named `message` should always be a string."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This isn't necessarily true. It depends on the context."
  - content: "Which of the following is the output of `Console.WriteLine(34.40M);`?"
    choices:
    - content: "`34.40M`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. An `M` is a literal suffix."
    - content: "`34.4`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Using the decimal literal `M` or `m` will print a number that includes values after the decimal point."
    - content: "`34.40`"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct!"
  - content: "Which of the following lines of code creates a variable correctly?"
    choices:
    - content: "`int x = 12.3m;`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. An `int` can't be set to a literal decimal value."
    - content: "`decimal x = 12.3m;`"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! The assignment correctly matches the declared data type."
    - content: "`bool x = 'False';`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The first problem is that you can't use a single quote to create a `string` literal. The second problem is that you can't set a `bool` to a `string` or `char` literal."
