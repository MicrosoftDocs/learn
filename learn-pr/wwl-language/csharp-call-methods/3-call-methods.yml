  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "Which of the following represents the correct way to create a class instance?"
    choices:
    - content: "`Random dice = new Random.Next();`."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Declaring an instance of a class requires a reference to the class. In this case `Random.Next()` is a reference to the `Next()` method, not the class."
    - content: "`Random dice = new Random();`."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! Defining the type and including the `new` operator is the correct way to create a class instance."
    - content: "`String dice = new Random();`."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The `Random` type must be used to define an instance of the `Random` class."
  - content: "A developer creates an instance of the `Random` class named `coins`. Which of the following code lines can they use to implement the `Next()` method?"
    choices:
    - content: "`int money = new coins.Next();`."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The keyword `new` can't be used when calling a method."
    - content: "`int money = Random.Next();`."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The `Random.Next()` method cannot be accessed directly (using the `Random` class) because it is a stateful method."
    - content: "`int money = coins.Next();`."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! This statement uses your instance of the `Random` class, `coins`, to return a random number."
