  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "What is a return value?"
    choices:
    - content: "It's a value type returned by a method."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! This is the correct definition of a return value."
    - content: "An argument in a method call is referred to as a return value inside the method."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A parameter of a method corresponds to an argument in the method call."
    - content: "It's a string value."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A return value could be a string, but it could also be an int32, a float, a custom type, or something else."
  - content: "What are method parameters?"
    choices:
    - content: "Variables that are used inside a method."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! Method parameters are variables used inside the method. The method definition specifies the names and types of any parameters that are required. When a caller invokes the method, the calling statement provides concrete values, called arguments, for each parameter."
    - content: "Values returned by a method."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The term \"return value\" does not refer to one or more method parameters."
    - content: "Variables that are passed into a method by the calling statement."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The values passed to a method in the calling statement are referred to as arguments."
  - content: "What is an overloaded method?"
    choices:
    - content: "A method that returns a value type."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Returning a value does not make a method an overloaded method."
    - content: "A method with more than five parameters."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. An overloaded method might include more than five parameters."
    - content: "It is a method that supports several implementations of the method, each with a unique method signature."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! This is the correct definition of an overloaded method."
  - content: "How does IntelliSense help developers?"
    choices:
    - content: "IntelliSense can help developers write code more quickly."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! IntelliSense can catch misspelling, incorrect usage, and suggest corrections. These things speed up the coding process."
    - content: "IntelliSense helps developers refactor their code."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While IntelliSense can help developers with their coding, it is not intended to be used as a code refactoring tool."
    - content: "IntelliSense can change the \\\"theme\\\" of an IDE."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. IntelliSense is not used for this purpose."
