Your goal was to call methods defined in the .NET Class Library to perform tasks like generating a random number or performing a mathematical operation.

Using C# syntax, you called different kinds of methods in the .NET Class Library: methods that returned values, methods that accepted multiple input parameters, and methods that maintained state. You used Visual Studio Code IntelliSense and learn.microsoft.com to research methods, and to improve your understanding of what a method does and how it works.

Imagine how much effort it would take to develop software if you didn't have a vast library of classes and methods (all of which you didn't have to build personally). The .NET Class Library is a boon to millions of developers. Tens of thousands of businesses rely on applications that are built on top of the methods implemented in the .NET Class Library.

In learning how to harness the .NET Class Library, you've taken a large step towards understanding how software developers build real world applications.
