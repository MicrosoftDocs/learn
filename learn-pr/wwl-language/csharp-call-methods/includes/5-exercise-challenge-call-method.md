## Math class methods challenge

In this challenge, you'll use either Intellisense or learn.microsoft.com to find and call a method that returns the larger of two numbers.

## Code challenge: Implement a method of the Math class that returns the larger of two numbers

Here are your challenge requirements:

1. Ensure that you have an empty Program.cs file open in Visual Studio Code.

1. Enter the following code as the starting point for your challenge.

    ```c#
    int firstValue = 500;
    int secondValue = 600;
    int largerValue;
    
    Console.WriteLine(largerValue);
    
    ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > Your final solution for this challenge must use this code, and must use the `Console.WriteLine(largerValue);` statement to generate the output.

1. Find a method of the `System.Math` class that returns the larger of two numbers.

    You can use either Visual Studio Code "Intellisense" or learn.microsoft.com to find the method and determine how to call it properly.

1. Use the method that you found to assign a value to the variable named `largerValue`.

    You should be able to pass the two integer values, `firstValue` and `secondValue`, to the method that you found. The method should return a value of type `int` that represents the larger of the two arguments that you passed it.

    You can assign the return value to `largerValue` on a new code line or on the existing code line that's used to declare `largerValue`.

1. Verify that your application writes the following output:

```Output
600

```
