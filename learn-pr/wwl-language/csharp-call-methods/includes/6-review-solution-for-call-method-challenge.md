The following code is one possible solution for the challenge from the previous unit.

```c#
int firstValue = 500;
int secondValue = 600;
int largerValue;
largerValue = Math.Max(firstValue, secondValue);
Console.WriteLine(largerValue);

```

The `Math.Max()` method supports 13 overloaded versions to accept different data types. The overloaded version of the `Math.Max()` method that you call will accept `int` as both input parameters, and returns the larger of the two values as an `int`.

When you run the code, you should see the following output:

```Output
600

```

If you succeeded, congratulations! Continue on to the knowledge check in the next unit.
