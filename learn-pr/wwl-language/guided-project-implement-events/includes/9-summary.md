When you want something to occur every time a specific event occurs in your program, either triggered by the user or the system itself, you can use events and delegates. You handle the event by associating it with a delegate. In this arrangement, a "listener" listens for an event. When the event occurs, the event calls the associated delegate and executes the method it contains.

In this module, you focused on reviewing how to create and use events and how to connect them to the new UI elements.

You learned about:

- Events and delegates.
- How to implement event handler stub methods.

Congratulations for learning about how to handle events in your code!
