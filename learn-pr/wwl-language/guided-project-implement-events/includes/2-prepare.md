You'll be using the VS Code Editor as your code development environment. You'll be writing code that uses event handlers.

## Project overview

This module guides you through the steps required to continue building the LangtonsAnts demonstration. It teaches you how to associate UI events with event handlers.

## Setup

Use the following steps to prepare for the Guided Project exercises:

1. Create a working directory with File Explorer in your Desktop folder called **LangtonsAnts**.

1. Download the zip file containing the Starter project code by selecting the following link: [Starter Files](https://codeload.github.com/MicrosoftLearning/Guided-Project-delegates-events-exceptions/zip/refs/heads/main).

1. Unzip the download files to your working directory.

    1. On your local machine, navigate to your downloads folder in File Explorer.

    1. Right-click **Guided-Project-delegates-events-exceptions**, and then select **Extract all**.

    1. Select **Show extracted files when complete**, and then select **Extract**.

    1. Open the **Guided-Project-delegates-events-exceptions** folder.

    1. Type Ctrl-A to select all of the files in the folder.

    1. Type Ctrl-C to copy them to the clip board.

    1. Navigate to the LangtonsAnts folder you created, type Ctrl-V to copy the files into the folder.

1. Open the new **LangstonsAnts** folder in VS Code.

    1. Right-click in an empty space on the screen and select **Show more options**.

    1. Select **Open with Code**.

        The VS Code should show the **Final**, **Solution** and **Starter** folders in the VS Code Explorer pane.

1. Start working on the exercises using the Starter code.

    1. Select View --> Terminal from the menu.

    1. In the terminal window, type cd Starter\WPF to change the current directory to the Starter code.

    1. Build the Starter code by typing `dotnet build` and press Enter.

    1. Run the Starter code by typing `dotnet run`.

If you're able to run the code successfully, you're now ready to begin the Guided Project exercises. Good luck!

> [!NOTE]
> If you were unable to build and run the Starter code, make sure you went through steps 1-5 correctly and that you are in the Terminal window directory for the Starter code. Remember, to build and run this code you will need to be in the Starter directory.
