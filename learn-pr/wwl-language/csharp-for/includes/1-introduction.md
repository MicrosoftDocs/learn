There are several ways to add looping logic in your application, and depending on the context, each provides a nuanced set of features that have both pros and cons.

Suppose you're about to start working on an application that processes string and numeric data using single dimensional and multidimensional arrays. After an initial review, you realize that `foreach` statements do not support looping logic that will be required in many cases. You'll need another approach for iterating through multidimensional arrays, and for situations where `foreach` loops don't provide the level of iteration control that's needed. You need to gain experience using `for` statements if you're going to succeed on this project.

In this module, you'll begin by writing `for` statements that iterate a specific number of times. After implementing a basic `for` statement, you'll learn how to implement `for` statements that iterate backwards through an array, skip over array elements during an iteration, or process only specified elements of an array (by changing the `for` statement's initializer, condition, and iterator).

By the end of this module, you'll be able to use `for` statements to implement looping logic when `foreach` statements don't support the scenario.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you will:

- Use a `for` statement to loop through a block of code.
- Examine the `for` statement syntax that enables you to control the iteration pattern.

## Prerequisites

- Experience with the `foreach` iteration statement.
- Experience working with variables.
