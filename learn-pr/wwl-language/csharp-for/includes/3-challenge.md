Code challenges throughout these modules will reinforce what you've learned and help you gain some confidence before continuing on.

## FizzBuzz challenge

FizzBuzz is a popular coding challenge and interview question. It exercises your understanding of the `for`, the `if`, the `%` remainder operator, and your command of basic logic.

### Step 1 - Delete all of the code in the .NET Editor from the earlier exercise

Select all of the code in the .NET Editor, then select the <kbd>Del</kbd> or <kbd>Backspace</kbd> key to delete it.

### Step 2 - Implement the FizzBuzz challenge rules

Using the .NET Editor, implement each rule.

**FizzBuzz rules:**

- Output values from 1 to 100, one number per line.
- When the current value is divisible by 3, print the term `Fizz` next to the number.
- When the current value is divisible by 5, print the term `Buzz` next to the number.
- When the current value is divisible by **both** 3 and 5, print the term `FizzBuzz` next to the number.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You'll need to understand how to use the `%` remainder operator to determine if a number is divisible by another number evenly. We covered this in the [Perform basic operations on numbers in C#](/training/modules/csharp-basic-operations/) module.

No matter how you do it, your code should produce the following output. We'll only show the first 22 values, but your output should continue to 100.

```output
1
2
3 - Fizz
4
5 - Buzz
6 - Fizz
7
8
9 - Fizz
10 - Buzz
11
12 - Fizz
13
14
15 - FizzBuzz
16
17
18 - Fizz
19
20 - Buzz
21 - Fizz
22

```

As you can see, the number `15` is divisible by both 3 and 5, so we print `FizzBuzz` next to the number.
