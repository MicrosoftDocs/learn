quiz:
  title: "Knowledge check"
  questions:
  - content: "Which of the following `for` statements is correct?"
    choices:
    - content: "`for (int x = 20: x < 80: x++)`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A colon can't be used as an end of statement operator."
    - content: "`for (int j = 0; j < 80; j + 1)`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The iterator section `j + 1` causes a compilation error."
    - content: "`for (int counter = 20; counter < 80; counter++)`"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct!"
  - content: "Which of the following statements should be used to exit out of a `for` loop before the iteration has completed?"
    choices:
    - content: "`exit;`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The word \"exit\" isn't a keyword in C#."
    - content: "`break;`"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! The `break` keyword can be used to jump out of a `for` loop when a desired condition is met."
    - content: "`return;`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The `return` keyword would exit out of the entire method."
