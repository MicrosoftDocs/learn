abstract: |
  After you complete this module, you'll be able to:
  - Use the for statement to loop through a block of code
  - Modify how the .NET Runtime executes the looping logic, changing the value of the iterator, the condition and the pattern
prerequisites: |
  *   Experience creating simple C# applications that include console I/O and access the methods of .NET classes such as String and Random
  *   Experience using Visual Studio Code to develop, build, and run C# console applications that implement arrays, if-elseif-else statements, and foreach statements
  *   Experience using C# code to evaluate conditional expressions and manage variable scope inside and outside of code blocks
  *   Experience using the switch-case construct to match a variable or expression against several possible outcomes
