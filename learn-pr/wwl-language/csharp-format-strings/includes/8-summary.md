Your company needed to create a personalized marketing message to promote a new financial product to your customers. Using C#, you were able to write code that combined string and numeric data about your current customers.

You exercised different techniques for merging a string template with variables using composite formatting and string interpolation. The various specifiers allow you to properly format large numbers, currency, and percentages. The built-in methods on variables of type string allowed you to add padding to left and right align data.

Imagine how much extra work would have required if you didn't have a wealth of string and number formatting tools and techniques available to you in C#. You would likely attempt to use string concatenation everywhere, possibly making it difficult to maintain or update.

Techniques and tools for formatting strings and numeric data has a wide array of applications. For example, you can use these techniques to present data for display on screen and format data to transfer between disparate systems.
