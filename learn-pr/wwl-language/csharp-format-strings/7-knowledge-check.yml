  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "For the C# code `Console.WriteLine(\"C110\".PadLeft(6, '0'));`, which is the expected output?"
    choices:
    - content: "`C11000`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. `.PadLeft(6, '0')` doesn't append zeros to the right side of the string."
    - content: "`C110000000`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. `.PadLeft(6, '0')` won't append zeros to the right side of a string and won't append after the string reaches six characters long."
    - content: "`00C110`"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. `.PadLeft(6, '0')` appends zeros to the left side of a string until the string is six characters long."
  - content: "Which format specifier presents a decimal value with the following format to an en-US audience: `12,345.67`"
    choices:
    - content: "`0:C`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Though it looks similar, the numeric value is not necessarily currency."
    - content: "`0:H`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. `H` isn't a known format specifier."
    - content: "`0:N2`"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. `N2` is the correct format specifier!"
  - content: "Which character must be used as a directive to perform string interpolation?"
    choices:
    - content: "`$`"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The `$` directive is used to perform string interpolation."
    - content: "`@`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. `@` is used to create a verbatim string literal, and doesn't perform string interpolation."
    - content: "`%`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. `%` is used for math to return the remainder (modulus), but isn't a valid directive for string interpolation."
