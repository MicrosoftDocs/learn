  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "Which line of code uses logical negation?"
    choices:
    - content: "`Console.WriteLine(!value);`."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! Adding the `!` operator (the \"not-operator\") before a conditional expression forces your code to reverse its evaluation of the operand. When logical negation is applied, the evaluation produces `true` if the operand evaluates to `false` and `false` if the operand evaluates to `true`."
    - content: "`Console.WriteLine(value != false);`."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Using the inequality operator to evaluate whether `value` isn't equal to `false` isn't an example of logical negation."
    - content: "`Console.WriteLine(a != b);`."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Using the inequality operator to evaluate whether two values aren't equal isn't an example of logical negation."
  - content: "Which of the following lines of code is a valid use of the conditional operator?"
    choices:
    - content: "`int value = amount >= 10? 10: 20;`."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! The syntax for a conditional operator is \"? (value 1) : (value 2)\"."
    - content: "`int value = amount >= 10: 10? 20;`."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The conditional operator is reversed."
    - content: "`int value = amount >= 10? 10| 20;`."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The pipe character isn't a component of the conditional operator syntax."
