## Conditional operator challenge

In this challenge, you'll implement a conditional operator to simulate a "coin flip". The resulting decision logic will display either `heads` or `tails`.

## Code challenge: write code to display the result of a coin flip

Here are your challenge requirements:

1. Ensure that you have an empty Program.cs file open in Visual Studio Code.

    If necessary, open Visual Studio Code, and then complete the following steps to prepare a Program.cs file in the Editor:

    1. On the **File** menu, select **Open Folder**.

    1. Use the Open Folder dialog to navigate to, and then open, the **CsharpProjects** folder.

    1. In the Visual Studio Code EXPLORER panel, select **Program.cs**.

    1. On the Visual Studio Code **Selection** menu, select **Select All**, and then press the Delete key.

1. Use the `Random` class to generate a value.

    Consider the range of numbers that is required.

1. Based on the value generated, use the conditional operator to display either `heads` or `tails`.

    There should be a 50% chance that the result is either heads or tails.

1. Your code should be easy to read, but with as few lines as possible.

    You should be able to accomplish the desired result in three lines of code.
