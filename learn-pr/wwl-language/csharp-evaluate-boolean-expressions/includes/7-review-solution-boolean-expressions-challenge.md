The following code is one possible solution for the challenge from the previous unit.

```c#
string permission = "Admin|Manager";
int level = 53;

if (permission.Contains("Admin"))
{
    if (level > 55)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Welcome, Super Admin user.");
    }
    else
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Welcome, Admin user.");
    }
}
else if (permission.Contains("Manager"))
{
    if (level >= 20)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Contact an Admin for access.");
    }
    else
    {
        Console.WriteLine("You do not have sufficient privileges.");
    }
}
else
{
    Console.WriteLine("You do not have sufficient privileges.");
}
```

This code is merely "*one possible solution*" because in some cases it's possible to use different Boolean expressions to get the same result.

```Output
Welcome, Admin user.
```

If you were successful, congratulations! Continue on to the knowledge check in the next unit.
