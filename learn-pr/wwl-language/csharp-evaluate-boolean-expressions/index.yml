title: Evaluate Boolean expressions to make decisions in C#
summary: Learn the operators and techniques required to evaluate and compare values in your decision statements.
abstract: |
  After you complete this module, you'll be able to:
  -   Use operators to create Boolean expressions that test for comparison and equality.
  -   Use built-in methods to the string class to perform better evaluations on strings.
  -   Use the negation operator to test for the opposite of a given condition.
  -   Use the conditional operator to perform an inline evaluation.
prerequisites: |
  -   Experience creating simple C# applications that include console I/O and access the methods of .NET classes such as String and Random.
  -   Experience using Visual Studio Code to develop, build, and run C# console applications that implement arrays, if-elseif-else statements, and foreach statements.
