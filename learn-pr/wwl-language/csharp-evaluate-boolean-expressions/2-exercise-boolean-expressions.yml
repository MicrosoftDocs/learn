quiz:
  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "Which of the following is a list of valid comparison operators?"
    choices:
    - content: "`==`, `~=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, and `<=`."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. `~=` isn't a valid comparison operator."
    - content: "`==`, `<>`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, and `<=`."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. `<>` isn't a valid comparison operator."
    - content: "`==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, and `<=`."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, and `<=` are all valid comparison operators."
  - content: "Which of the following code lines uses logical negation?"
    choices:
    - content: "`Console.WriteLine(myValue!= true);`."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Using the \"not equal\" operator isn't an example of logical negation."
    - content: "`Console.WriteLine(!myValue);`."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! Adding the `!` operator before a conditional expression is the correct way to implement logical negation."
    - content: "`Console.WriteLine(myValue == false);`."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Evaluating whether a value is equal to `false` isn't an example of logical negation."
  - content: "An application contains two string variables named `myValue1` and `myValue2`. The user enters the following two values for these variables: \"Y \" and \" y\". Which of the following expressions return `false`?"
    choices:
    - content: "`(myValue1!= myValue2)`."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This expression returns `true` because the two values aren't equivalent."
    - content: "`(myValue1.Trim().ToLower() != myValue2.Trim().ToLower())`."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! This expression returns `false` since the two values are equal and the inequality operator is being used."
    - content: "`(myValue1.Trim().ToLower() == myValue2.Trim().ToLower())`."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This expression returns `true` because the two values are equal, and the equality operator is being used."
