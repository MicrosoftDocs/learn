  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "What is the purpose of defining an optional parameter in a method?"
    choices:
    - content: "To cause a method to perform a different task."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A method should generally perform the task it's named to do, and an optional parameter should reflect a trivial difference."
    - content: "To overload a method."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Adding an optional parameter doesn't overload a method."
    - content: "To simplify the required parameters when a parameter isn't significant to the result."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! Optional parameters enable you to pass fewer arguments and accomplish the method task."
  - content: "What is the purpose of pseudo-code?"
    choices:
    - content: "To provide a design template for the intended code."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! Pseudo-code helps to bridge the gap between concept and code."
    - content: "To safely cast operations performed in methods."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Pseudo-code doesn't have an effect on written operations."
    - content: "To develop syntactically correct code."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Pseudo-code doesn't help with syntax, instead it plans general tasks before the exact code is written."
