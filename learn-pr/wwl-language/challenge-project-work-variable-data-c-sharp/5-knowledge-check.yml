  questions:
  - content: "To sort a string array, why is it important to use the `String.Trim()` method on each array element before sorting?"
    choices:
    - content: "Only string arrays with elements trimmed with `String.Trim()` can sort"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. `String.Trim()` doesn't prevent or enable sorting of a string array."
    - content: "`String.Trim()` removes leading white space that would sort before numbers and letters."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. String.Trim() removes white spaces that would interfere with sorting."
    - content: "The array sort is noticeably faster using `String.Trim()` on each element."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The array sort isn't noticeably faster using `String.Trim()`."
  - content: "Both `foreach` and `for` are good choices to iterate small single dimension arrays like {\"cat\", \"fox\", \"dog\", \"snake\", \"eagle\"}, but when is it best to use a `for` loop?"
    choices:
    - content: "When the elements have alphabetical sort order"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. You sort elements effectively with either a `foreach` or `for` loop."
    - content: "When you need to perform a search on each element in the array"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A search of each element using both `foreach` and `for` is appropriate."
    - content: "When you need to evaluate a specific range of elements"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. A `for` is better when you want index ranges that aren't the *first* to the *last* index."
