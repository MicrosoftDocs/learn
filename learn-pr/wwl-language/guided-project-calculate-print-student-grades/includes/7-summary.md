Your goal was to build an application that takes the assignment scores for students in a class, calculates their grade, and displays the results. 

To accomplish this, you declared and assigned values to variables of different data types, performed numeric operations, and used type casting to achieve accurate results. You also used `Console.WriteLine()` and character escape sequences to format the output.

By breaking the problem down, you were able to build a solution using the skills you learned in the previous modules. Congratulations on developing a structured application!
