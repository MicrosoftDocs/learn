  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "What does the following code accomplish? `var value = (int) dividend / (int) divisor;`"
    choices:
    - content: "Casts the operands to truncate the result"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The operands are casted to the int data type that will create an implicitly typed int result"
    - content: "Declares an explicitly typed int variable"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The var keyword creates an implicitly typed variable"
    - content: "Casts the operands to prevent truncating the result"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The operands are casted to the int data type that will truncate the result"
  - content: "Why does the tab appear to be a space in the output of the following code? `Console.WriteLine(\"Student\\tGrade\");`"
    choices:
    - content: "The tab escape sequence is incorrect"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. `\\t` is the correct escape sequence for tab"
    - content: "The next tab stop after `Student` is simply one space wide"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Printing a tab fills variable length whitespace until a position divisible by 4 is reached"
    - content: "The tab escape sequence needs to be doubled (`\\t\\t`) to work"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A single `t` will display a tab correctly"
  - content: "What is wrong with the following code? `int sophiaSum; Console.WriteLine(\"Sophia: \" + sophiaSum);`"
    choices:
    - content: "`sophiaSum` is not initialized before use"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. You must set a variable to a value before you can reference the value from the variable"
    - content: "`sophiaSum` is not implicitly typed to a string"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Using Console.WriteLine will implicitly convert variables into strings"
    - content: "`sophiaSum` should use the var keyword"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. var variables need to be initialized immediately"
