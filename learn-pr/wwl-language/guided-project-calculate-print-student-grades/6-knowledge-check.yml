  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "What does the following code accomplish? `var value = (int) dividend / (int) divisor;`"
    choices:
    - content: "Casts the operands to truncate the result."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The operands are casted to the int data type that will create an implicitly typed int result."
    - content: "Declares an explicitly typed int variable."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The var keyword creates an implicitly typed variable."
    - content: "Casts the operands to prevent truncating the result."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The operands are casted to the int data type that will truncate the result."
  - content: "What does the `$` symbol do when used in a string in C#?"
    choices:
    - content: "It allows you to use string interpolation to include variables in the string."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! The `$` symbol allows you to use string interpolation to include variables in the string."
    - content: "It indicates that the string is a regular expression."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The `$` symbol doesn't indicate a regular expression."
    - content: "It indicates that the string is a verbatim string literal."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The `$` symbol doesn't indicate a verbatim string literal."
  - content: "What is wrong with the following code? `int sophiaSum; Console.WriteLine(\"Sophia: \" + sophiaSum);`"
    choices:
    - content: "`sophiaSum` isn't initialized before use."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. You must set a variable to a value before you can reference the value from the variable."
    - content: "`sophiaSum` isn't implicitly typed to a string."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Using Console.WriteLine will implicitly convert variables into strings."
    - content: "`sophiaSum` should use the var keyword."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. var variables need to be initialized immediately."
