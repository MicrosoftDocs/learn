The following code is one possible solution for the challenge from the previous unit.

```c#
Random random = new Random();
int daysUntilExpiration = random.Next(12);
int discountPercentage = 0;

if (daysUntilExpiration == 0)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Your subscription has expired.");
}
else if (daysUntilExpiration == 1)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Your subscription expires within a day!");
    discountPercentage = 20;
}
else if (daysUntilExpiration <= 5)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Your subscription expires in {daysUntilExpiration} days.");
    discountPercentage = 10;
}
else if (daysUntilExpiration <= 10)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Your subscription will expire soon. Renew now!");
}

if (discountPercentage > 0)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Renew now and save {discountPercentage}%.");
}

```

This code is merely "*one possible solution*" because a lot depends on how you decided to implement the logic. As long as you got the right results per the rules in the challenge, and you used two `if` statements, you did great!

If you're successful, congratulations! Continue on to the knowledge check in the next unit.
