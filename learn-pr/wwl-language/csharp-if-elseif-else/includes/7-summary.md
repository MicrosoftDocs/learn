Your goal in this module was to add branching logic to your code by using decision statements.

Using `if`, `else if`, and `else` statements, you evaluated Boolean expressions to create alternative execution paths through your application. This allowed you to execute some code and ignore other code, depending on some condition. Without decision statements, your applications would lack the ability to automate common business, gaming, and scientific tasks required in modern applications.

You'll come to rely on the techniques we learned in this module in virtually every application we build.
