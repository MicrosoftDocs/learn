abstract: |
  - Learn the fundamental differences between *value types* and *reference types*.
  - Describe the properties of many new numeric data types, including new *integral types* and *floating-point* types.
  - Write code that returns the maximum and minimum values that numeric data types can store.
  - Use the `new` keyword to create new instances of a reference type.
  - Determine which data type you should choose for a given application.
prerequisites: |
