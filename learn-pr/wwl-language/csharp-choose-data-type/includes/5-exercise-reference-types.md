Reference types include arrays, classes, and strings. Reference types are treated differently from value types regarding the way values are stored when the application is executing.

In this exercise, you learn how reference types are different from value types, and how to use the `new` operator to associate a variable with a value in the computer's memory.

## How reference types are different from value types

A value type variable stores its values directly in an area of storage called the *stack*. The stack is memory allocated to the code that is currently running on the CPU (also known as the stack frame, or activation frame). When the stack frame has finished executing, the values in the stack are removed.

A reference type variable stores its values in a separate memory region called the *heap*. The heap is a memory area that is shared across many applications running on the operating system at the same time. The .NET Runtime communicates with the operating system to determine what memory addresses are available, and requests an address where it can store the value. The .NET Runtime stores the value, and then returns the memory address to the variable. When your code uses the variable, the .NET Runtime seamlessly looks up the address stored in the variable, and retrieves the value that's stored there.

You'll next write some code that illustrates these ideas more clearly.

## Define a reference type variable

1. Delete or use the line comment operator `//` to comment out all of the code from the previous exercises.

1. Update your code in the Visual Studio Code Editor as follows:

    ```csharp
    int[] data;
    ```
  
    The previous code defines a variable that can hold a value of type `int` array.

    At this point, `data` is merely a variable that could hold a reference, or rather, a memory address of a value in the heap. Because it's not pointing to a memory address, it's called a *null reference*.

1. Create an instance of `int` array using the `new` keyword

    Update your code in the Visual Studio Code Editor to create and assign a new instance of `int` array, using the following code:

    ```csharp
    int[] data;
    data = new int[3];
    ```

    The `new` keyword informs .NET Runtime to create an instance of `int` array, and then coordinate with the operating system to store the array sized for three int values in memory. The .NET Runtime complies, and returns a memory address of the new `int` array. Finally, the memory address is stored in the variable data. The `int` array's elements default to the value `0`, because that is the default value of an `int`.

1. Modify the code example to perform both operations in a single line of code

    The two lines of code in the previous step are typically shortened to a single line of code to both declare the variable, and create a new instance of the `int` array. Modify the code from step 3 to the following.

    ```csharp
    int[] data = new int[3];
    
    ```

    While there's no output to observe, hopefully this exercise added clarity to how the C# syntax relates to the steps of the process for working with reference types.

### What's different about the C\# string data type?

The `string` data type is also a reference type. You might be wondering why a `new` operator wasn't used when declaring a string. This is purely a convenience afforded by the designers of C#. Because the `string` data type is used so frequently, you can use this format:

```csharp
string shortenedString = "Hello World!";
Console.WriteLine(shortenedString);

```

Behind the scenes, however, a new instance of `System.String` is created and initialized to "Hello World!".

## Recap

- Value types can hold smaller values and are stored in the stack. Reference types can hold large values, and a new instance of a reference type is created using the `new` operator. Reference type variables hold a reference (the memory address) to the actual value stored in the heap.
- Reference types include arrays, strings, and classes.
