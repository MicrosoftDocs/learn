Choosing the right data type for your application is a vital programming skill. Your goal was to understand the differences between each data type to make an informed decision on the data types in your code.

You have criteria you can use when deciding which data types to employ in your code. Finally, you understand why you need to use the `new` keyword when creating instances of reference types.
