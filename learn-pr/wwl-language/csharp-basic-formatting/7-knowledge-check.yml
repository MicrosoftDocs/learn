  questions:
  - content: "Which of the following escape sequences should be used to add double quotes to a literal string in C# code?"
    choices:
    - content: "'`\\q`'"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. \\q isn't a valid escape sequence."
    - content: "'`\\'`'"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. \\' is the escape sequence for a single quote, not a double quote."
    - content: "'`\\\"`'"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Correct, `\\\"` will display double quotes!"
  - content: "Which of the following lines of code correctly uses string interpolation assuming that the variable `value` is a string?"
    choices:
    - content: "'`Console.WriteLine(@\"My value: {value}\");`'"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This line uses the at `@` symbol instead of the dollar `$` symbol as the prefix for string interpolation."
    - content: "'`Console.WriteLine($\"My value: {value}\");`'"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct!"
    - content: "'`Console.WriteLine(@\"My value: [value]\");`'"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This line uses the at `@` symbol instead of the dollar `$` symbol, and square brackets instead of curly braces for the interpolation expression."
  - content: "Unicode characters were embedded in the C# strings for a console application to present a greeting message in Thai. However, the message is only displayed as question mark characters.  What is a possible cause?"
    choices:
    - content: "A missing \\u escape sequence for Unicode characters."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. If the \\u escape sequence for Unicode characters aren't used, only numbers will appear, question marks won't be displayed."
    - content: "The wrong Unicode characters were used."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This is unlikely.  It would only be true if all the Unicode characters were the same value representing a question mark--\\u003F."
    - content: "The user's console doesn't support Unicode characters."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct.Correct!"
  - content: "Which of the following lines of code append a single `\\` to the string `directory`?"
    choices:
    - content: "'`directory = directory + \"\\\";`'"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This line escapes the `\"` character and results in an error."
    - content: "'`directory = directory + '\\';`'"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This line escapes the `'` character and results in an error."
    - content: "'`directory = directory + @\"\\\";`'"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The `@` symbol creates a verbatim string where it's unnecessary to escape the `\\`."
