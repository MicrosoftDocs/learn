Code challenges will reinforce what you've learned and help you gain some confidence before continuing on.

In this challenge, you'll print instructions to the end user to let them know where your application will output data files. You won't be actually creating any files -- you're only interested in displaying formatted instructions to the console window.

You'll use what you've learned about character escape sequences, verbatim strings, unicode, and string interpolation to provide instructions in both English and Russian.

### Challenge: Format and display instructions

1. Select all of the code in the .NET Editor, and press <kbd>Delete</kbd> or <kbd>Backspace</kbd> to delete it.

1. Begin solving the challenge with the following two lines of code.

  ```csharp
  string projectName = "ACME";

  string russianMessage = "\u041f\u043e\u0441\u043c\u043e\u0442\u0440\u0435\u0442\u044c \u0440\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0432\u044b\u0432\u043e\u0434";
  ```

  The `projectName` variable will be used twice in the desired output.

  The `russianMessage` variable contains the message "View Russian output" in Russian. You must use this variable in your code that prints the message.

  You may not change these two lines of code, but you can add code above and below each line. You must use these two lines of code to form the desired output.

1. You may only use either the `Console.WriteLine()` or the `Console.Write()` method twice.

  In other words, to complete this challenge, you can only create two instructions that actually print output to the console. If you need to print additional new lines or add any formatting, you must use what you've learned in this module to accomplish it.

1. Use character escape sequences, verbatim strings, unicode, and string interpolation to generate the output.

  To complete this challenge, your code must produce the following output.

  ```Output
  View English output:
    c:\Exercise\ACME\data.txt

  Посмотреть русский вывод:
    c:\Exercise\ACME\ru-RU\data.txt

  ```

  Take note of the new lines, the tabs, and how the two mandatory lines of code are used in the output.
