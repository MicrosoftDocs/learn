Your goal was to write code that formats strings with special characters, such as double quotes, new lines, tabs, and other white space, as well as unicode characters. You also combined strings using two different techniques.

Using character escape sequences, you added special characters in your literal strings by either using special escaping sequences or using verbatim strings. You added Unicode characters from other language sets like Japanese Kanji and Russian Cyrillic in your literal strings. You used simple string concatenation with the `+` symbol, and upgraded to string interpolation for combining values into a string template.

Without the ability to format your output, you would be severely restricted in what kinds of information you could present to the user. However, now you can provide your users with sophisticated instructions and feedback with a wide variety of formatting, symbols, and languages.
