      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Methods should throw an exception whenever they can't complete their intended purpose."
    - content: "A method should throw an exception when an exception type matches the intended purpose of the method."

    - content: "The `Message` property shouldn't explain the reason for the exception."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The `Message` property of an exception should explain the reason for the exception."
    - content: "The `Message` property should explain the reason for the exception."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The `Message` property of an exception should explain the reason for the exception. Since `Message` is a read-only property, it must be assigned when instantiating the exception object."
