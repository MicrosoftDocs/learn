  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "Which of the following method signatures correctly defines 3 integer parameters?"
    choices:
    - content: "`void Multiply(int a, b, c)`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The data type for each parameter must be included."
    - content: "`void Multiply(int a, int b, int c)`"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! The data type for each parameter is included and parameters are comma separated."
    - content: "`void Multiply(int a; int b; int c)`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Parameters should be separated by commas."
  - content: "Given the method signature, `void Print(string name, string number = \"\", bool member = false)`, which of the following options correctly uses named and optional arguments?"
    choices:
    - content: "`Print(\"Tony\", member: true);`"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! The optional argument is included using the parameter name followed by a `:`"
    - content: "`Print(number: \"555\", member: false)`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. All required arguments must be included."
    - content: "`Print(\"Tony\", false)`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. `false` needs to be a named argument using the parameter name `member`."
  - content: "Given the following method signature, `void SetHealth(string health)`, why don't operations inside the method affect the original input string `health`?"
    choices:
    - content: "The `string` data type is pass by value."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Strings are pass by reference, but they're immutable so the value can't be altered once assigned."
    - content: "The method code must be incorrect."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Strings are pass by reference, but they're immutable so the value can't be altered once assigned."
    - content: "Strings can't be altered once assigned, they can only be overwritten with a new value."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! Strings are pass by reference, but they're immutable and can't be altered once assigned."
