You can improve application performance and remove bottlenecks that impede performance by creating computation-bound and io-bound operations as Tasks.

In this module, you learned how to implement asynchronous programming in C# to create a new Task and prevent the UI from freezing during calculations. Additionally, you learned how to implement asynchronous IO operations using the `async` and `await` keywords in C# to make file IO operations asynchronous and prevent UI freezes.

The main takeaways from this module are:

- Implement asynchronous programming in C# to create a new Task and prevent UI freezes during calculations.
- Implement asynchronous IO operations using the `async` and `await` keywords in C# to make file IO operations asynchronous and prevent UI freezes.
