Code challenges reinforce what you've learned and help you gain some confidence before continuing.

This module features two code challenges. This first challenge forces you to split up the data depending on its type and either concatenate or add the data accordingly.

> [!NOTE]
> The code samples in this exercise are designed based on en-US culture settings, and use a period (`.`) as the decimal separator. Building and running the code with a culture setting that uses a different decimal separators (such as a comma `,`) may give unexpected results or errors. To fix this issue, replace the period decimal separators in the code samples with your local decimal separator (such as `,`).
> Alternatively, to run a program using the en-US culture setting, add the following code to the top of your program: `using System.Globalization;` and after any other `using` statements add `CultureInfo.CurrentCulture = new CultureInfo("en-US");`.

1. Select and delete all code lines in the Visual Studio Code Editor. Optionally, use the line comment operator `//` to comment out all of the code from the previous step.

1. To instantiate a string array, enter the following "starter" code:

    ```csharp
    string[] values = { "12.3", "45", "ABC", "11", "DEF" };
    ```

1. Create a looping structure that can be used to iterate through each string value in the array `values`.

1. Complete the required code, placing it within the array looping structure code block. It's necessary to implement the following business rules in your code logic:

    - Rule 1: If the value is alphabetical, concatenate it to form a message.
    - Rule 2: If the value is numeric, add it to the total.
    - Rule 3: The result should match the following output:

        ```Output
        Message: ABCDEF
        Total: 68.3
        ```

1. Once your code is complete, in the Visual Studio Code **File** menu, select **Save**.

    The Program.cs file must be saved before building or running the code.

1. In the EXPLORER panel, to open a Terminal at your TestProject folder location, right-click **TestProject**, and then select **Open in Integrated Terminal**.

    A Terminal panel should open, and should include a command prompt showing that the Terminal is open to your TestProject folder location.

1. At the Terminal command prompt, to run your code, type **dotnet run** and then press Enter.

    You should see the following output:

    ```Output
        Message: ABCDEF
        Total: 68.3
    ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you see a message saying "Couldn't find a project to run", ensure that the Terminal command prompt displays the expected TestProject folder location. For example: `C:\Users\someuser\Desktop\csharpprojects\TestProject>`
