  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "Which technique results in an error when used to convert a `string` value `\"4.123456789\"` into a `decimal`?"
    choices:
    - content: "`Convert.ToDecimal()`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Using `ToDecimal` is a valid technique and doesn't result in an error."
    - content: "`decimal.TryParse()`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Using `TryParse` is a valid technique and doesn't result in an error."
    - content: "`(decimal)`"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. It isn't possible to directly cast a `string` into a `decimal` and results in an error."
  - content: "What type of action is being performed when changing a `float` into an `int`?"
    choices:
    - content: "A narrowing conversion."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Changing a `float` into an `int` is a narrowing conversion, because `float` can store more precision data compared to `int`."
    - content: "A widening conversion."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Changing a `float` into an `int` isn't a widening conversion because `float` can store more precision data than an `int` can store."
    - content: "An illegal conversion."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Changing a `float` into an `int` isn't an illegal conversion. It can be accomplished, but it's with the loss of precision data."
