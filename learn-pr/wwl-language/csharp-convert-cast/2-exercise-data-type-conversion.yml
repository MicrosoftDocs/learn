  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "Which is the best technique to convert a decimal type to an int type in C#?"
    choices:
    - content: "cast"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. `decimal` to `int` is a narrowing conversion so `cast` is the best answer."
    - content: "narrowing"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That’s incorrect. \"Narrowing\" describes the data precision change in a conversion."
    - content: "implicit conversion"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That’s incorrect. `decimal` to `int` is a narrowing conversion and implicit conversion can't be used because data loss is possible."
  - content: "Which of the following conversion rounds the value (versus truncate)?"
    choices:
    - content: "`int cost = (int)3.75m;`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That’s incorrect. Casting truncates all decimals."
    - content: "`int cost = Convert.ToInt32(3.75m);`"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That’s correct. `Convert.ToInt32()` rounds values with fractional precision"
    - content: "`uint cost = (uint)3.75m;`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That’s incorrect. Casting truncates all decimals."
