  questions:
  - content: "Which choice best describes the purpose of `TryParse()`?"
    choices:
    - content: "To split sentences into words stored in an array."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. `TryParse()` doesn't split sentences into words."
    - content: "To safely test a cast operation"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. `TryParse()` returns a `bool` if (true or false) indicating if a cast can be completed."
    - content: "To find a substring in a larger string"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. `TryParse()` doesn't find a substring in a larger string."
  - content: "For the code `decimal.TryParse(numberString, out myConvert))` when the type of `numberString` is a String. Which best describes the value type for `myConvert` when the `TryParse()` is successful?"
    choices:
    - content: "A string representing numeric digits."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A constant might be used to replace a magic string or number, but they aren't the same thing."
    - content: "A Boolean value."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The `TryParse()` returns a boolean value, but the `out` variable `myConvert` isn't a Boolean."
    - content: "A decimal"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. For `decimal.TryParse()` the `out` variable, `myConvert` is a decimal."
