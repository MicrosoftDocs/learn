Suppose you're a developer who likes to support the local community. You and some of your friends started a business that helps find new homes for stray or abandoned cats and dogs. Your business started off small, with just a couple of animals, but it's starting to grow. Your friends have an initial application developed that enables the entry and display of the animals available for adoption. They ask you to investigate adding features to the app that could help to match the animals in your care with people who are looking for a new family pet.

In completing this coding project, you apply your C# data knowledge and skills in:

- Choosing the correct data types and safely converting data types.
- Manipulating number, string and character arrays, as well as adding, removing, and sorting data.
- Modifying and building complex strings from multiple data sources, and formatting data for display across regions.

Your team has found that it's important to search the pet data to identify animals with possible matches based on characteristics provided by potential owners. Further, the team wants to include a fundraising feature to include suggested donation data and to present the pet data with fewer lines of output.

You begin with a starting application that adds a predefined *sample* data to the pets array. The application has two menu items. The first item displays all the pet data, and the code is complete.  The second is menu item, "Display all dogs with a specified characteristic", is "work in progress" that you complete.

You also make updates to existing code to add `suggestedDonation` data and display all data in a shortened format.

By the end of this module, you're able to develop code that combines iteration statements with data input, data processing, string indexing, and data output.
