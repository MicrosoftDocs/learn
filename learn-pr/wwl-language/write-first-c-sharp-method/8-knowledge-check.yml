  - content: "Which of the following correctly declares a method?"
    choices:
    - content: "`DisplayNumbers();`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. To declare a method, you need to include a return type."
    - content: "`void DisplayNumbers{};`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Methods must use parentheses `()` after the name, and brackets `{}` to contain the method body."
    - content: "`void DisplayNumbers() { }`"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. A method is declared using the return type, followed by parentheses `()` containing any parameters, and brackets `{}` to contain the method body."
  - content: "Which of the following correctly calls a method?"
    choices:
    - content: "`GenerateID();`"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! Methods are called using the name, followed by parentheses `()` and a semicolon"
    - content: "`void GenerateID() {}`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. To call a method, you must include parentheses `()` after the name, followed by a semicolon"
    - content: "`GenerateID;`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. To call a method, you must include parentheses `()` after the name, followed by a semicolon"
  - content: "Which of the following is true about the `return` keyword?"
    choices:
    - content: "It is identical to the `break` keyword."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The `break` keyword terminates a loop or `switch` statement, but the `return` keyword terminates the current method."
    - content: "It terminates the execution of a method."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! The return statement terminates execution of its method and returns control to the caller."
    - content: "It must always be used with a value or expression."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. `void` methods don't return values and can use the `return` keyword on its own."
