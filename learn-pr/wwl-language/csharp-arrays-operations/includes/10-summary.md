In this module, you completed exercises using helper methods to use arrays more effectively to:

- Clear items in an array, learning the elements are set to null, using the `Array.Clear()`method.
- Resize an array to add and remove elements using the `Array.Resize()` method.
- Convert a string into an array using `String.Split()` specifying a string separator character to produce a value in the returned array.
- Combine all of the elements of an array into a single string using the `String.Join()` method.

The array helper methods allowed you to work flexibly with data in the applications. Without these features, arrays would be less useful.
