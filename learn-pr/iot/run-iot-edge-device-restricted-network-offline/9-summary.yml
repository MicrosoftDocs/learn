  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:

  - content: 'What does the use of Parent / Child relationships including an IoT Edge Gateway (the parent) and other IoT Devices (the child or leaf devices) enable?'
    choices: 
    - content: 'The use of Offline capabilities within an Azure IoT solution'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation:  Once messages reach the parent IoT Edge Device, the IoT Edge Modules and Routing will handle the messages as configured; including sending the messages to the Azure IoT Hub when connected.
    - content: 'The ability to remove child devices within an Azure IoT solution'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Think about the solution delivered specifically addressing the capture of data.
    - content: 'The ability to add security certificates to child devices within an Azure IoT solution'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Think about the solution delivered specifically addressing the capture of data.

  - content: 'Within the Azure Cloud Shell, what communication protocols were given commands to add Inbound rules to the NSG?'
    choices: 
    - content: 'TCP and UDP'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Remember we are looking for communication protocols.
    - content: 'SMTP, IMAP & POP3'
