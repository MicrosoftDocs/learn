  - content: 'What is the default order of layers in Azure Maps, from the lowest up?'
    choices: 
    - content: 'base, transit, labels, flow'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: You can leave off the flow, for a less stressful map!
    - content: 'base, labels, transit, flow'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Labels take priority over transit.
    - content: 'base, transit, flow, labels'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Flow takes priority over labels.
      
  - content: 'The sample app adds layers to the top of the layer stack. Which layers?'
    choices: 
    - content: 'The statement is false, no layers are added.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Layers are added.
    - content: 'One layer, containing the routes, and city point data.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: More than one layer is added.     
    - content: 'Two layers. One for route lines, the other to display point data.'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: The routes for the car, truck, and bicycle are on one layer, the city names, and icons on the other layer.
    - content: 'Three layers. One layer for each of the car, truck, and bicycle.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Fewer than three layers are added.
    - content: 'Four layers are added. One for each of the car, truck, and bicycle. And one layer for city point data.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Fewer than four layers are added.

  - content: 'In Azure IoT, a sister product to Azure Maps, what are temperature, velocity, lat/lon values transmitted from devices known as?'
    choices: 
    - content: 'telemetry'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: The most common telemetry values are temperature, humidity, velocity, acceleration, pressure, and location.
    - content: 'streaming data'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Close, but there is a more specific term.
    - content: 'layers'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: No, layers apply only to map construction.

  - content: 'The Primary Key, that you extract from your Azure Maps account, is required for what purpose?'
    choices: 
    - content: 'The Primary Key is used to verify that you have access to Azure resources.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: No, separate keys are required for each resource. You cannot, for example, use an Azure Maps key to access an Azure IoT resource.
    - content: 'The Primary Key is used by Azure Maps, to verify that the app making the requests of the resource is from a legit subscription.'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Either the Primary Key, or the Secondary Key, works for this purpose.    
    - content: 'The Primary Key is used to verify that your subscription has been paid up to date.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: No, Azure resources are free in this module.

  - content: 'Which API component is used to adjust the view of the map, so that the start and end points are clearly visible?'
    choices: 
    - content: 'camera'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: A bounding box is calculated based on the start and end points.
    - content: 'coordinates'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Coordinates are used to send the start, end, and all intermediary points, to the route finding service.
    - content: 'layers'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: No, layers apply only to map construction.

  - content: 'Which of the following data sets might work with a heat map?'
    choices: 
    - content: 'A: earthquakes in the last 30 days'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Other data sets might work too.
    - content: 'B: route finding'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Route finding isn't suitable for displaying as a heat map.
    - content: 'C: construction cranes per square mile'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Other data sets might work too.
    - content: 'D: population growth'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Other data sets might work too.
    - content: 'All of the above'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Not all the above data sets would work with a heat map.
    - content: 'A, C, and D'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Events, with varying strengths, tied to a geographical location, do make good data for rendering in heat maps.
