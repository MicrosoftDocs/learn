  - content: "What is the default order of layers in Azure Maps, from the lowest up?"
    choices: 
    - content: "Base, transit, labels, flow."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: You can leave off the flow, for a less stressful map!
    - content: "Base, labels, transit, flow."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Labels take priority over transit.
    - content: "Base, transit, flow, labels."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Flow takes priority over labels.
      
  - content: "The sample app adds layers to the top of the layer stack. Which layers?"
    choices: 
    - content: "The statement is false. No layers are added."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Layers are added.
    - content: "One layer, containing the routes, and city point data."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: More than one layer is added.     
    - content: "Two layers. One for route lines, the other to display point data."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: The routes for the car, truck, and bicycle are on one layer, the city names, and icons on the other layer.
    - content: "Three layers. One layer for each of the car, truck, and bicycle."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Fewer than three layers are added.
    - content: "Four layers are added. One for each of the car, truck, and bicycle. And one layer for city point data."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Fewer than four layers are added.

  - content: "In Azure IoT, a sister product to Azure Maps, what are the values for temperature, velocity, and lat/lon that are transmitted from devices known as?"
    choices: 
    - content: "Telemetry"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: The most common telemetry values are temperature, humidity, velocity, acceleration, pressure, and location.
    - content: "Streaming data"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Close, but there's a more specific term.
    - content: "Layers"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: No, layers apply only to map construction.

  - content: "The Primary Key, that you extract from your Azure Maps account, is required for what purpose?"
    choices: 
    - content: "The Primary Key is used to verify that you have access to Azure resources."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: No, separate keys are required for each resource. You can't, for example, use an Azure Maps key to access an Azure IoT resource.
    - content: "The Primary Key is used by Azure Maps, to verify that the app making the requests of the resource is from a legit subscription."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Either the Primary Key, or the Secondary Key, works for this purpose.    
    - content: "The Primary Key is used to verify that your subscription is from a legit subscription."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: No, Azure resources are free in this module.

  - content: "Which API component is used to adjust the view of the map, so that the start and end points are clearly visible?"
    choices: 
    - content: "Camera"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: A bounding box is calculated based on the start and end points.
    - content: "Coordinates"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Coordinates are used to send the start, end, and all intermediary points, to the route finding service.
    - content: "Layers"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: No, layers apply only to map construction.

  - content: "Which of the following data sets might work with a heat map?"
    choices: 
    - content: "A: earthquakes in the last 30 days"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Other data sets might work too.
    - content: "B: route finding"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Route finding isn't suitable for displaying as a heat map.
    - content: "C: construction cranes per square mile"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Other data sets might work too.
    - content: "D: population growth"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Other data sets might work too.
    - content: "All of the listed data sets."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Not all these data sets would work with a heat map.
    - content: "A, C, and D"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Events, with varying strengths, tied to a geographical location, do make good data for rendering in heat maps.
