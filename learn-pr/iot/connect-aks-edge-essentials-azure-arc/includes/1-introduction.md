Once you set up on-premises Kubernetes using AKS Edge Essentials and create a Kubernetes cluster, you can manage your Kubernetes infrastructure using the Azure portal, which provides a centralized management console for Kubernetes clusters running anywhere. In addition, various Azure Arc-enabled services like Azure policy, Azure monitor, and Azure Machine Learning services enable you to ensure compliance, monitor your clusters, and run cloud-services on your edge clusters. It helps to ensure that applications and clusters are consistently deployed and configured at scale from source control.
