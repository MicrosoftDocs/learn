  questions:
    - content: 'Which of the following ThreadX service calls should be used to obtain an instance from a semaphore?'
      choices:
        - content: 'tx_semaphore_put(&my_semaphore, TX_NO_WAIT)'
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: 'Incorrect. A get operation must be used.'
        - content: 'tx_mutex_get(&my_semaphore, TX_NO_WAIT)'
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: 'Incorrect. A counting semaphore must be used.'
        - content: 'tx_semaphore_get(&my_semaphore, TX_WAIT_FOREVER)'
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: 'Correct.'
        - content: 'All of these service calls are correct'
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: 'Incorrect. A semaphore_get operation must be used.'
    - content: 'Which of the following ThreadX resources embodies the property of ownership?'
      choices:
        - content: 'Mutex'
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: 'Correct.'
        - content: 'Counting semaphore'
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: 'Incorrect. Only a mutex has the concept of ownership.'
        - content: 'Application timer'
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: 'Incorrect. Only a mutex has the concept of ownership.'
        - content: 'None of these resources'
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: 'Incorrect. Only a mutex has the concept of ownership.'
    - content: 'Which of the following ThreadX resources has the property of priority inheritance?'
      choices:
        - content: 'Counting semaphore'
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: 'Incorrect. Only a mutex has the concept of priority inheritance.'
        - content: 'Mutex'
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: 'Correct.'
        - content: 'Application timer'
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: 'Incorrect. Only a mutex has the concept of priority inheritance.'
        - content: 'None of these resources'
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: 'Incorrect. Only a mutex has the concept of priority inheritance.'
    - content: "Which of the following ThreadX service calls can't cause suspension?"
      choices:
        - content: 'tx_mutex_get(&my_mutex, WAIT_FOREVER)'
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: 'Incorrect. A semaphore_get operation with TX_NO_WAIT never causes suspension.'
        - content: 'tx_mutex_get(&my_mutex, 1)'
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: 'Incorrect. A semaphore_get operation with TX_NO_WAIT never causes suspension.'
        - content: 'tx_semaphore_get(&my_semaphore, TX_NO_WAIT)'
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: 'Correct.'
        - content: 'tx_semaphore_get(&my_semaphore, 5)'
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: 'Incorrect. A semaphore_get operation with TX_NO_WAIT never causes suspension.'
    - content: 'Which of the following ThreadX service calls could result in thread suspension?'
      choices:
        - content: 'tx_semaphore_put(&my_semaphore, TX_WAIT_FOREVER)'
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: 'Incorrect. This semaphore put service call is invalid.'
        - content: 'tx_semaphore_get(&my_semaphore, TX_NO_WAIT)'
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. The TX_NO_WAIT option means that suspension can't occur."
        - content: 'tx_semaphore_get(&my_semaphore, 5)'
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: 'Correct.'
        - content: 'All of these service calls are correct'
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: 'Incorrect. Only one of the options is correct.'
