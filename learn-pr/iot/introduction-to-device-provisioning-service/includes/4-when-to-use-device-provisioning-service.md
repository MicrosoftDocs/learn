There are many provisioning scenarios in which the Device Provisioning Service is an excellent choice for getting devices connected and configured to IoT Hub, such as:

 -  Zero-touch provisioning to a single IoT solution without hardcoding IoT Hub connection information at the factory (initial setup)
 -  Load-balancing devices across multiple hubs
 -  Connecting devices to their ownerâ€™s IoT solution based on sales transaction data (multitenancy)
 -  Connecting devices to a particular IoT solution depending on use-case (solution isolation)
 -  Connecting a device to the IoT hub with the lowest latency (geo-sharding)
 -  Reprovisioning based on a change in the device
 -  Rolling the keys used by the device to connect to IoT Hub (when not using X.509 certificates to connect)
