Azure IoT Hub Device Provisioning Service enables the provisioning of IoT devices using a combination of enrollment, provisioning, and attestation features.

Suppose you have joined a team that is implementing an Azure IoT solution for the company. The company needs to manage the deployment of thousands of devices and asked you to determine whether Device Provisioning Service (DPS) is the right solution.

In this module, you'll determine when to use DPS to manage device enrollment, provisioning, and attestation. You'll also learn about some key terms and concepts so that you can plan for a successful first deployment.

By the end of this module, you will be able to evaluate whether DPS is appropriate for your IoT scenario and to describe how DPS works to secure devices through their provisioning lifecycle.
