In this module, you learned about key concepts of the Device Provisioning Service, including:

* How DPS automates the initial provisioning process.
* The difference between individual and group enrollments, and when to use each.
* The supported attestation methods of X.509 certificates, TPM, and symmetric keys and how DPS authenticates devices based on their attestation method.
* How DPS handles device lifecycle events using reprovisioning policies.

With this information, you feel comfortable recommending whether or not your team moves forward with testing DPS for your IoT solution.
