quiz:
  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "A company is investigating the IoT Hub Device Provisioning Service as an option for provisioning devices. Which of the following answer choices accurately describes support provided by the Device Provisioning Service?"
    choices:
    - content: "Provides multi-hub support that allows the Device Provisioning Service to assign devices to more than one IoT hub and region."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The IoT Hub Device Provisioning Service provides multi-hub support that allows it to assign devices to more than one IoT hub and region."
    - content: "Provides enrollment lists for the devices that are registered with each specific IoT Hub for a subscription."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The IoT Hub Device Provisioning Service uses a single enrollment list that specifies the devices that may be registered with an IoT hub, and specifies which IoT hub the device will be registered with if/when registration occurs."
    - content: "Provides support for removing IoT and IoT Edge devices from the IoT hub registry for each IoT hub in a subscription."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The IoT Hub Device Provisioning Service does not remove devices from the IoT Hub identify registry."
  - content: "A company will be using the IoT Hub Device Provisioning Service (DPS) to provision a large number of devices. They will begin by creating a plan for device enrollments. What is device enrollment?"
    choices:
    - content: "Device enrollment is a DPS-enabled process for automatically adding a single device or group of devices to the IoT Hub identity registry."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Device enrollment does not add devices to the IoT Hub identity registry."
    - content: "Device enrollment is a DPS-enabled process for creating a record of a single device or a group of devices that may at some point be registered with IoT Hub."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Device enrollment is a DPS-enabled process for creating a record of a single device or a group of devices that may at some point be registered with IoT Hub."
    - content: "Device enrollment is a DPS-enabled process for creating a record of the devices connected to IoT Hub using the X.509 attestation mechanism."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Device enrollment is not specific to devices connected to IoT hub or devices that use X.509 certificates for attestation."
  - content: "Which of the following answers correctly describes attestation and the attestation mechanisms supported by the IoT Hub Device Provisioning Service (DPS)?"
    choices:
    - content: "Attestation is a process for linking DPS to one or more IoT hubs."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Linking DPS to one or more IoT hubs is a configuration setting for DPS and is not related to attestation."
    - content: "Attestation is a process for confirming a device's identity."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Attestation is a process for confirming a device's identity."
    - content: "The attestation mechanisms supported by DPS are Symmetric Key and TPM."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Symmetric Key attestation is supported by DPS, but TPM (Trusted Platform Module) is not used for attestation."
