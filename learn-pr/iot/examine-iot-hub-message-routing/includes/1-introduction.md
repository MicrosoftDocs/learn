Azure IoT Hub is the primary entry-point for device information that must be evaluated and delivered to the appropriate cloud services within an IoT solution.

Suppose you joined a team that is implementing an Azure IoT solution for the company. The company needs your team to implement device message processing in support of data analytics and other downstream requirements. Understanding how Azure IoT Hub processes messages and events helps to ensure that the implementation is successful. You decide to begin by examining Azure IoT Hub message routing.

In this module, you will:

* Review message processing concepts.
* Examine the Azure IoT Hub common message features and features of Azure IoT Hub message routing.
* Examine the built-in and custom endpoints that can be used with Azure IoT Hub message routing.
* Examine the message routing query syntax.

By the end of this module, you'll be able to describe how an Azure IoT Hub solution uses message routing to process message and event data.
