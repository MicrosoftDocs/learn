In this module, you learned how to:

- Create an Azure IoT Central custom app by using the IoT Central portal.
- Create a device template for a custom device by using the IoT Central portal.
- Create a programming project to simulate a sensor device in a refrigerated truck. You used routes selected by Azure Maps.
- Monitor and command the simulated device from the IoT Central Device portal.

## Clean up

If you used a trial subscription in the IoT Central app, your work is deleted automatically when the trial ends.

If you created a new Azure Maps account for this module, you will need to clean up your account by deleting the resource. If you created a new resource group for your Azure Maps account, then you need to delete the resource group, and this will automatically delete the Azure Maps account.
