  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:

  - content: 'What keys are required to connect an app to IoT Central?'
    choices: 
    - content: 'Device ID and Primary Key'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Both of these values are needed, but more information is needed to complete a connection.
    - content: 'Scope ID, Device ID, and Primary Key'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: These three strings identify the app, the device, and permission to communicate with IoT Central.
    - content:  'Scope ID, Device ID, Primary Key, and Secondary Key'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Secondary Key isn't needed.
      
  - content: 'In our scenario, what states can the cooling fan be in?'
    choices: 
    - content: 'On, Off, and Failed'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: A failing cooling fan triggers a series of events, melting contents, truck recalls, that is helpful to simulate.
    - content: 'On, Off, and Melting.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: A melting cooling fan would be bad, but isn't something that is simulated.
    - content: 'On and Off.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Unfortunately, mechanical systems aren't this perfect.

  - content: 'In our scenario, the simulated time interval is 60 seconds, the actual time interval is 5 seconds. What does this mean?'
    choices:    
    - content: 'The simulation runs in real time, with 12 sets of telemetry data communicated to IoT Central every minute.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Telemetry data is sent 12 times per minute, but the simulation doesn't run in real time.
    - content: 'The simulation runs at 60 times real time, with the telemetry reported every five seconds.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: The simulation doesn't run at 60 times real time.
    - content: 'The simulation is run at 60/5 = 12 times real time.'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Many simulations are set to run faster than real time.
