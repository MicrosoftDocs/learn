  questions:
    - content: 'Which phrase best describes event chaining?'
      choices:
        - content: "It's the ability of a thread to suspend on multiple resources."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: 'Correct! Event chaining refers to the ability of a thread to suspend on multiple resources.'
        - content: "It's when two or more queues are chained together."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. Event chaining isn't when two or more queues are chained together."
        - content: "It's when two or more threads are chained together."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. Event chaining isn't when two or more threads are chained together."
    - content: 'Which of the following ThreadX service calls can be used to register a callback function?'
      choices:
        - content: 'tx_queue_register'
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. This ThreadX service call can't be used to register a callback function."
        - content: 'tx_queue_send_notify'
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: 'Correct! This is the ThreadX service call that can be used to register a callback function.'
        - content: 'tx_queue_gateway'
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. This ThreadX service call can't be used to register a callback function."
    - content: 'Which ThreadX service call is usually placed in a notification function?'
      choices:
        - content: 'tx_semaphore_put'
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: 'Correct! This is the ThreadX service call that is usually placed in a notification function.'
        - content: 'tx_semaphore_get'
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. This ThreadX service call isn't usually placed in a notification function."
        - content: 'tx_semaphore_info_get'
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. This ThreadX service call isn't usually placed in a notification function."
    - content: 'What happens when a queue send notification function is registered for Queue_1?'
      choices:
        - content: 'ThreadX sends a message to Queue_1.'
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: 'Incorrect! ThreadX monitors Queue_1 and when a message is sent to Queue_1, the notification function is invoked.'
        - content: 'ThreadX sends a message to all the queues.'
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. In this scenario, ThreadX doesn't send a message to all the queues."
        - content: 'ThreadX monitors Queue_1 and when a message is sent to Queue_1, the notification function is invoked.'
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: 'Correct. In this scenario, the notification function is invoked when a message is sent to Queue_1.'
    - content: 'Which one of the following statements is true about event chaining?'
      choices:
        - content: 'The number of threads and associated resources are increased.'
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: 'Incorrect. In event chaining, the number of threads and associated resources are reduced.'
        - content: 'It prevents a thread from waiting on multiple resources.'
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: 'Incorrect. Event chaining permits a thread to wait on multiple resources by using notification functions.'
        - content: 'It simplifies thread activation in situations that involve multiple independent events.'
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: 'Correct! Event chaining simplifies thread activation in situations that involve multiple independent events.'
