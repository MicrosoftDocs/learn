  title: "IoT application with IoT Edge pattern"
  questions:
  - content: "Where does the IoT Edge runtime run?"
    choices:
    - content: "On an IoT Edge device"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The IoT Edge runtime runs on each IoT Edge device and manages the modules deployed to each device."
    - content: "In an Azure service"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "No. The IoT Edge runtime runs on a device and interacts with Azure services such as IoT Hub."
    - content: "In your IoT Central application"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "No. The IoT Central UI lets you manage IoT Edge device by communicating with the IoT Edge runtime on the device."
  - content: "What is the role of a deployment manifest?"
    choices:
    - content: "It specifies the capabilities of a device you want to connect to your application"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "no. A device template specifies the capabilities of a device you want to connect to your application."
    - content: "It contains information that lets the IoT Edge runtime determine which IoT Edge modules to download and run"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. When an IoT Edge device connects to an IoT Central application, the IoT Edge runtime downloads the deployment manifest to determine which modules it should install and run on the device."
    - content: "It specifies the type of IoT Central application to deploy to your Azure subscription"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "No. An IoT Central application template specifies the initial configuration of your IoT Central application."
