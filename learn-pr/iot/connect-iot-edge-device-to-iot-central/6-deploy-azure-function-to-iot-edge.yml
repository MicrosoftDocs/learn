  title: "Use Azure Functions at the edge"
  questions:
  - content: "Where can you run an Azure function?"
    choices:
    - content: "In the cloud and in an IoT Edge module"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Yes. You can run an Azure function in either location."
    - content: "Only in the cloud"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "No. You can also run an Azure function in an IoT Edge module if you want the processing to happen locally."
    - content: "Only in an IoT Edge module"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "No. You can also run an Azure function in the cloud if you're building scalable cloud solutions."
  - content: "What is the role of routing in a deployment manifest?"
    choices:
    - content: "It routes messages between IoT Edge modules"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Yes. It routes messages between modules. For example routing telemetry from a sensor to a filter module before sending it to your IoT Central application."
    - content: "It routes messages to devices in IoT Central"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "No. Each IoT Edge device is configured to send data to a specific device in IoT Central. Routing doesn't affect this behavior."
    - content: "It routes messages to specific IoT Hub instances in the cloud"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "No. Each IoT Edge device is connected to a specific IoT Hub. Routing doesn't affect this behavior."
