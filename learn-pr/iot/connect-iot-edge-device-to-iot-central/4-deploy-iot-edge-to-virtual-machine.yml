  title: "Deploy IoT Edge to a VM"
  questions:
  - content: "How does an IoT Edge device connect to IoT Central?"
    choices:
    - content: "Using information in the configuration file on the device"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Yes. The configuration file on the IoT Edge device includes information such as the scope ID, device ID, and device key for a device in IoT Central."
    - content: "Using information in the deployment manifest"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "No. The device downloads the deployment manifest after it connects to IoT Central. The deployment manifest specifies the modules to run."
    - content: "Using information passed as command line parameters"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "No. The IoT Edge modules run as Docker containers that read configuration information from a file."
  - content: "Where does an IoT Edge device download modules from?"
    choices:
    - content: "A GitHub repository"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "No. Although module source code might be stored in GitHub, modules are stored in a dedicated container registry."
    - content: "A container registry"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Modules are downloaded from a container registry such as Azure Container Registry or Docker Hub."
    - content: "Your IoT Central application"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "No. A device template in IoT Central contains the IoT Edge deployment manifest that specifies the modules the device must download from a container registry."
