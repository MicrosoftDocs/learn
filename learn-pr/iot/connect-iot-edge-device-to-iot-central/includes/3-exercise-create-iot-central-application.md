Create an IoT Central application for your IoT Edge devices to connect to and be managed from.

Recall that you plan to deploy an IoT Edge device in each store to manage the local sensors and filter the data that's sent to IoT Central.

Here, you'll use the Azure CLI to create an IoT Central application from the **Custom application** template. You'll run the CLI commands in the Azure sandbox and then navigate to the application's web UI. In the web UI, you complete the setup by adding a device template for your IoT Edge device.

[!INCLUDE [learn-pr/includes/azure-optional-exercise-subscription-note](../../../includes/azure-optional-exercise-subscription-note.md)]

## Download the deployment manifest

When you create the device template for your IoT Edge device, you'll need the deployment manifest and an interface definition on your local machine. You can download these files by right-clicking on the following links and choosing **Save as**:

- [EnvironmentalSensorManifest-1-4.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure-Samples/iot-central-docs-samples/main/iotedge/EnvironmentalSensorManifest-1-4.json)
- [TelemetryInterface.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure-Samples/iot-central-docs-samples/main/iotedge/TelemetryInterface.json)

Remember where you save these files, you'll use them later.

## Create and configure the IoT Central application

The following steps create an IoT Central application and generate an API token to use later in this module.

1. Run the following commands in the Cloud Shell to generate a unique name for your IoT Central application and save it in an environment variable to use later:

    ```azurecli
    APP_NAME="store-manager-$RANDOM"
    echo "Your application name is: $APP_NAME"
    ```

    Make a note of the application name just in case the shell times out and loses the environment variable.

1. Run the following command in the Cloud Shell to create an IoT Central application in the sandbox:

    ```azurecli
    az iot central app create \
    --resource-group <rgn>[sandbox resource group name]</rgn> \
    --name $APP_NAME --sku ST2 --location centralus \
    --subdomain $APP_NAME --template iotc-pnp-preview \
    --display-name 'Store Management'
    echo "You can now navigate to: https://$APP_NAME.azureiotcentral.com/edge-manifests"

    ```

    Expect this command to take a minute or two to run.

1. In another browser tab or window, navigate to the URL shown in the output of the previous command. This page in the web UI is where you upload an IoT Edge deployment manifest:

    :::image type="content" source="../media/3-deployment-manifests.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the deployment manifests page where you manage the IoT Edge deployment manifests in your IoT Central application.":::

1. Select **Create an edge manifest**, enter the name *Environmental Sensor*, select **Upload a file**, and then browse to select the *EnvironmentalSensorManifest-1-4.json* file you downloaded previously.

1. Select **Next** and then **Create** to upload the manifest. The manifest configures three IoT Edge modules: **edgeAgent**, **edgeHub**, and **SimulatedTemperatureSensor**.

1. Next select **Device templates**. This page in the web UI is where you create a device template:

    :::image type="content" source="../media/3-device-templates.png" alt-text="The device templates page where you manage the templates in your IoT Central application.":::

1. Select **Create a device template**, choose the **Azure IoT Edge** tile, and then select **Next: Customize**.

1. Enter *Environmental Sensor Edge Device* as the device template name. Then select **Next: Review**.

1. Select **Create** to create the device template. Then select **Custom model** to start with a blank model.

The deployment manifest you uploaded has a module called **SimulatedTemperatureSensor** with an interface called **management**. The **management** interface includes the writable properties **SendData** and **SendInterval**. To add this information to your new device template:

1. On the device template page, select **Modules** in the **Model** section.

1. Select **Import modules from manifest**:

    :::image type="content" source="../media/3-import-modules.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the device templates page where you import the module definitions from the deployment manifest.":::

1. Select the **Environmental Sensor** deployment manifest to import the modules.

Your device template now includes the **SimulatedTemperatureSensor** module with a **management** interface. The interface defines the **SendData** and **SendInterval** writable properties.

The deployment manifest doesn't include information about the telemetry the device modules send. To enable IoT Central to create visualizations for the telemetry, add an interface with the required definitions:

1. Select the **SimulatedTemperatureSensor** module and then select **+ Add inherited interface**. You may need to select **...** to see this option.

1. Choose the **Import interface** tile. Select the *TelemetryInterface.json* file you downloaded previously.

1. The **Telemetry** interface defines **machine** and **ambient** telemetry types as objects. The machine object includes temperature and pressure telemetry. The ambient object includes temperature and humidity telemetry. The interface also includes **timeCreated** as a **DateTime** telemetry type.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/3-telemetry-interface.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the telemetry interface in the device template.":::

To enable an operator to record information about each IoT Edge device, add the following **Cloud properties** to the **Environmental Sensor Edge Device** model:

| Display name | Name | Capability type | Schema |
| ------------ | ---- | ---- | ------ |
| Store Name | StoreName |Cloud Property| String |
| Service Date | ServiceDate |Cloud Property| Date |

:::image type="content" source="../media/3-cloud-properties.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the cloud properties in the device template.":::

> [!TIP]
> You need to expand the cloud property to see the schema setting.

Select **Save** to save the changes.

To enable an operator to view environmental data from your stores, add the following view to the device template:

1. To add a new view, select **Views** in the device template. Then choose the **Visualizing the device** tile.

1. Change the name of the view to *View IoT Edge device telemetry*.

1. Select **Start with devices**.

1. Add the **ambient / temperature**, **humidity**, **machine/temperature**, and **pressure** telemetry types, and then select **Add tile**.

1. Select **Save**.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/3-telemetry-view.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows telemetry view definition.":::

To enable the operator to record information about each store and manage the device, add the following view to the device template:

1. To add a new view, select **Views** in the device template. Then choose the **Editing device and cloud data** tile.

1. Change the form name to *Store information*.

1. Select the **Store Name** and **Service Date** cloud properties. Then select **Add section**.

1. Select **Save**.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/3-property-editor.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows cloud property form definition.":::

You're now ready to publish the template and add a device:

1. Select **Publish**, and then in the **Publish this device template to the application** dialog, select **Publish**.

1. Go to the **Devices** page in your IoT Central application.

1. Select the **Environmental Sensor Edge** device template and then select **+ New**.

1. In the **Create a new device** dialog, enter *store-001* as the device ID. Make sure that the device template is **Environmental Sensor Edge Device**. The **Azure IoT Edge device?** is already set to **Yes**. Then select **Environmental Sensor** as the edge manifest. Select **Create**.

1. The **store-001** device appears in the list of devices with the status **Registered**.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/3-registered-device.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the registered device in the device list.":::

## Check your work

1. In the list of devices, click on the device name **Environmental Sensor Edge Device - store-001**. You can see the available views for the device, including **Store information** and **View IoT Edge device telemetry**.

1. Select **Connect**. Make a note of the **ID scope**  and **Primary key**. You'll use these values later to configure your IoT Edge device to connect to your application.

Keep this page open in your web browser - you'll return to this IoT Central application later.

You've now created an application to manage your stores, created a device template that includes an IoT Edge deployment manifest for the devices you plan to install in your stores. The template includes views that will enable an operator to monitor the environmental conditions in the store and manage the devices remotely.
