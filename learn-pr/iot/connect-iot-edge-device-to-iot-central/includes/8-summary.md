Your company plans to deploy environmental monitoring devices to its stores. You were asked to design a solution that enables central monitoring, command, and control while minimizing the infrastructure requirements in each store. The solution should be robust if there are connectivity outages, and minimize the amount of data sent from each store.

IoT Edge devices deployed in each store can manage the local sensors and filter the data that's sent to IoT Central.

You configured an IoT Central application with a device template that defines the capabilities of the IoT Edge device. You added some dashboards that enabled an operator to view telemetry from the IoT Edge device, set properties, and control it with commands. To test the scenario, you deployed an IoT Edge device to a virtual machine and connected the device to your IoT Central application. When the basic scenario was working, you used Azure Functions to add filtering capabilities to the IoT Edge device.

Using IoT Edge devices in your stores delivers a robust solution that can handle connectivity outages and reduce the amount of data sent from each store.
