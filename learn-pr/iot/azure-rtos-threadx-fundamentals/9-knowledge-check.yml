  questions:
    - content: 'Which of the following statements is most correct for ThreadX RTOS scheduling?'
      choices:
        - content: 'It uses a priority-based preemptive scheduling approach.'
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: 'This is true, but note the other statements are also correct.'
        - content: 'It quickly responds to important events because it does not have to wait for any polling.'
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: 'This is true, but note the other statements are also correct.'
        - content: 'It schedules the ready thread with the highest priority that has been waiting for the processor the longest.'
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: 'This is true, but note the other statements are also correct.'
        - content: 'All of the above.'
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: 'All these statements are correct.'

    - content: 'Which of the following statements is most correct for threads?'
      choices:
        - content: 'It is possible for a thread to be in a ready state and a suspended state at the same time.'
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: 'A thread cannot be both in a ready state and a suspended state at the same time.'
        - content: 'Under certain circumstances, a suspended thread can be executed.'
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: 'A suspended thread would have to become ready before being executed.'
        - content: 'Each thread must have its own stack.'
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: 'Correct.'
        - content: 'All thread stacks must be the same size.'
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: 'A stack can be any size, but it must be large enough for successful thread operation.'

    - content: 'Which of the following statements is most correct for thread suspension?'
      choices:
        - content: 'There is only one way for a thread to become suspended.'
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: 'There are many ways for a thread to become suspended.'
        - content: 'A thread can be suspended because it needs a resource that is unavailable.'
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: 'Correct.'
        - content: 'The length of time for a thread to be suspended depends on its priority.'
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: 'Suspension time has nothing to do with priority.'
        - content: 'When a thread is removed from the suspended state, it is immediately terminated.'
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: 'In most cases, a suspended thread enters the ready state.'

    - content: 'Which of the following statements is most correct?'
      choices:
        - content: 'The Thread Control Block schedules all the threads.'
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: 'The Thread Control Block contains essential thread information and does no scheduling.'
        - content: 'The thread entry function stores the priority of a thread.'
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: 'The thread entry function stores executable code.'
        - content: 'The thread stack size is not important, so it can be assigned any value.'
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: 'Stack size is crucial and must be assigned a value large enough for successful thread operation.'
        - content: 'There is no explicit limit on how many threads can be created.'
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: 'Correct.'

    - content: 'Which of the following statements is most correct?'
      choices:
        - content: 'The context of a thread refers to the contents of the Thread Control Block.'
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: 'Thread context usually consists of register contents, program counter, and stack pointer.'
        - content: "When a thread's context has been restored, its priority is decreased by 1."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: 'There is no connection between priority and thread context.'
        - content: 'When a thread is preempted, its context must be saved.'
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: 'Correct.'
        - content: "A thread's context contains the number of times that thread has been preempted."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: 'Thread context usually consists of register contents, program counter, and stack pointer.'
