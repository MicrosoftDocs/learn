## Overview

In a previous module of this learning path, you were introduced to some fundamental concepts of Azure RTOS ThreadX (ThreadX). Concepts such as scheduling, determinism, priorities, preemption, and threads. You were also presented with an overview of ThreadX services and memory management options. You should now be ready to explore more ThreadX services and apply them in a project.

The purpose of the Hello World project in this module is to provide you with a practical introduction to ThreadX and demonstrate how it can be used. By investigating a small problem and developing a solution for it, you gain a better understanding of ThreadX, and discover why it's one of the most widely deployed RTOSes in the world.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you will:

- Be introduced to the basics of ThreadX system development.
- Walk through a simple illustrative example of a ThreadX project.
- Be given a simple but realistic scenario and identify the essential ThreadX components needed to implement that system.
- Understand the fundamentals required for a ThreadX real-time solution.
- Design and debug the ThreadX solution using a hands-on approach with GitHub Codespace or Visual Studio.

## Prerequisites
