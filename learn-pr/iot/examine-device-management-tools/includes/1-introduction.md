Azure IoT device management tools provide interactive user interfaces that can be used to perform IoT device management tasks. Capabilities include starting or stopping a device, reading or writing device state information, and firmware updates.

Imagine that you work as an operator in an electrical power monitoring and control room at a large auto manufacturing plant. One day you receive notification that a power line voltage measurement IoT device is malfunctioning, and is giving erratic readings that could affect the stability of the power grid. You decide to use an Azure IoT device management tool to bring the device offline.

In this module, you will:

- Review the Azure IoT device management tools and approaches
- Examine device management using Azure IoT extension for Azure CLI
- Examine device management using Visual Studio Code and the Azure IoT Hub extension

By the end of this module, you will be able to describe the service and coding tools that are used to implement device management tasks in Azure IoT Hub.
