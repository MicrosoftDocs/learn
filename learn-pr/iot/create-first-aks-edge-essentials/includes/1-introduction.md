AKS Edge Essentials is a Microsoft-supported Kubernetes platform that automates running containerized applications at scale. It's designed for static, predefined configurations and has minimal compute and memory requirements (4-GB RAM and 2 vCPUs). Each machine in an AKS Edge Essentials cluster can have one Linux and an optional Windows node.

## Example scenario

Imagine youâ€™re employed at an industrial factory as an IT specialist. Your company recognizes the significance of integrating AI-assisted computer vision for defect detection to enhance the safety of its workers. The company is committed to creating a secure environment and is seeking solutions to seamlessly integrate software that needs ongoing human supervision, without constant update feature disturbances. This solution should also facilitate the connection and management of multiple devices, ensuring robust security measures, while creating a specialized device. Your task is to empower the devices with the capability to identify potentially hazardous zones within the industrial setting.

## What will we be doing?

In this module, you'll learn how to prepare your machine and deploy AKS Edge Essentials to automate and run your containerized applications on Linux and Windows worker nodes.

## What is the main goal?

After you complete this module, you'll be able to prepare your Windows machines to then deploy AKS Edge Essentials and run containerized applications, whether on Linux or Windows, that leverage AI-assisted computer vision for defect detection.
