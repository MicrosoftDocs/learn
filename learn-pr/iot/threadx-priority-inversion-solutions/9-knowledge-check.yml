  questions:
    - content: 'Suppose that T1, T2, and T3 are threads that have priorities 1, 2, and 3, respectively. T1 and T2 share mutex M. Which of these statements describes a priority inversion problem?'
      choices:
        - content: 'T1 owns M, T3 attempts to get M, T2 preempts T3.'
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. This answer doesn't describe a priority inversion scenario."
        - content: 'T2 preempts T3, T1 gets M, T3 attempts to get M.'
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. This answer doesn't describe a priority inversion scenario."
        - content: 'T3 owns M, T2 preempts T3, T1 attempts to get M.'
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: 'Correct! This answer describes a priority inversion scenario.'
    - content: 'What danger does the priority inversion problem present?'
      choices:
        - content: 'It leads to a nondeterministic situation that might cause system failure.'
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: 'Correct! Priority inversion leads to a nondeterministic situation that might cause system failure.'
        - content: "It leads to a confusing situation because priorities aren't correct."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. This answer doesn't describe the primary danger posed by priority inversion."
        - content: 'The scheduler might incorrectly schedule threads.'
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. This answer doesn't describe the primary danger posed by priority inversion."
    - content: 'What is another name for preemption threshold?'
      choices:
        - content: 'Priority ceiling.'
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: 'Correct! Another name for preemption threshold is priority ceiling.'
        - content: 'Preemption preventer.'
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. Preemption preventer isn't another name for preemption threshold."
        - content: 'Priority blocker.'
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. Priority blocker isn't another name for preemption threshold."
    - content: 'Suppose thread N has a priority of 20 and a preemption threshold of 15. Which of the following statements is true?'
      choices:
        - content: 'Thread N can preempt a thread that has a priority greater than 15.'
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. In this scenario, thread N can't preempt a thread that has a priority greater than 15."
        - content: 'Only a thread that has a priority greater than 15 can preempt Thread N.'
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: 'Correct! In this scenario, only a thread that has a priority greater than 15 can preempt Thread N.'
        - content: 'A thread that has a priority less than 14 can preempt Thread N.'
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. In this scenario, a thread that has a priority less than 14 can't preempt Thread N."
    - content: 'Which of the following statements is true about preemption threshold?'
      choices:
        - content: 'Preemption threshold uses more overhead than priority inheritance.'
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: 'Incorrect. Preemption threshold uses less overhead than priority inheritance.'
        - content: 'Preemption threshold uses more context switches than priority inheritance.'
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: 'Incorrect. Preemption threshold uses fewer context switches than priority inheritance.'
        - content: "Preemption threshold is a feature that's unique to Azure RTOS ThreadX."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: 'Correct! Only ThreadX uses preemption threshold to solve the priority inversion problem.'
