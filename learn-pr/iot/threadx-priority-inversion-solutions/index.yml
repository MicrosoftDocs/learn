title: ThreadX priority inversion solutions
summary: Learn how preemption threshold and priority inheritance work as solutions to priority inversion in Azure RTOS ThreadX.
abstract: |
  In this module, you will:
  - Understand the dangers of priority inversion
  -	Understand how to use priority inheritance to avoid priority inversion problems.
  -	Understand how to use preemption threshold to avoid priority inversion problems.
  -	Understand the differences between these two solutions to the priority inversion problem.
  -	Design and debug a ThreadX solution using a hands-on approach with GitHub Codespace or Visual Studio.
  - Study the priority inversion problem, and compare the priority inheritance and preemption threshold solutions.
