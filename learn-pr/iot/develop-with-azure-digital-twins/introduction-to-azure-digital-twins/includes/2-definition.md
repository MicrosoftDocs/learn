Microsoft's definition of a *digital twin* is a digital replica of real-world things, places, business processes, and people. A digital twin is designed to understand, control, simulate, analyze, and improve real-world business operations. Azure Digital Twins is an Internet of Things (IoT) platform that enables the creation of next-generation IoT solutions that model the real world.

The IoT gives businesses unprecedented insights into their assets. As connected solutions continue to evolve, companies are looking to create comprehensive digital models of their entire environments to gain insights that:

- Drive better products.
- Optimize operations.
- Reduce costs.
- Create breakthrough customer experiences.

Examples include buildings, factories, farms, energy networks, railways, stadiums, and even entire cities.

Azure Digital Twins enables customers to model an environment and then bring this digital twin to life in a scalable and secure manner. Businesses can connect existing business systems and assets like IoT devices to Azure Digital Twins. Azure Digital Twins helps break down silos that previously stood in the way of insights and provides a robust platform on which to build dynamic business logic.

Azure Digital Twins seamlessly integrates with Azure data, analytics, and AI services to make it easy to track the past and then predict the future. This capability gives businesses the edge they need to meet the challenges they face today and tomorrow.
