  questions:

  - content: 'Which services are used by event routes to drive your desired data flows?'
    choices: 
    - content: 'Event Hub, Event Grid, Service Bus'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: 'An endpoint is a connection to a destination outside of Azure Digital Twins. Supported destinations are: Event Grid, EventHub, and Service Bus.'
    - content: 'Azure Data Lake, Azure Synapse Analytics, Logic Apps'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'An endpoint is a connection to a destination outside of Azure Digital Twins. Supported destinations are: Event Grid, EventHub, and Service Bus.'
    - content: 'Time Series Insights, Azure Maps, Azure Functions'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'An endpoint is a connection to a destination outside of Azure Digital Twins. Supported destinations are: Event Grid, EventHub, and Service Bus.'

  - content: 'Event routes are defined using data plane APIs. A route definition contains:'
    choices: 
    - content: 'The desired route ID'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'Event routes are defined using data plane APIs. A route definition contains: the desired route ID, desired endpoint ID, and a filter that defines which events are sent to the endpoint.'
    - content: 'The desired endpoint ID'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'Event routes are defined using data plane APIs. A route definition contains: the desired route ID, desired endpoint ID, and a filter that defines which events are sent to the endpoint.'
    - content: 'A filter that defines which events are sent to the endpoint'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'Event routes are defined using data plane APIs. A route definition contains: the desired route ID, desired endpoint ID, and a filter that defines which events are sent to the endpoint.'
    - content: 'All of the above'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: 'Event routes are defined using data plane APIs. A route definition contains: the desired route ID, desired endpoint ID, and a filter that defines which events are sent to the endpoint.'
  
  - content: 'The function will send the JSON objects and eventually connect to Time Series Insights using:'
    choices: 
    - content: 'An IoT Hub'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'The Azure Function will convert twin update events from their original form as JSON Patch documents to JSON objects, containing only updated, and added values from your twins. Then it will send the JSON objects it creates to an event hub to connect to Time Series Insights.'
    - content: 'An Event Hub'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: 'The Azure Function will convert twin update events from their original form as JSON Patch documents to JSON objects, containing only updated, and added values from your twins. Then it will send the JSON objects it creates to an event hub to connect to Time Series Insights.'
