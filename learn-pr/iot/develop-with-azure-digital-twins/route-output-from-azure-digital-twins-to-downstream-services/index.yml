title: Output from Azure Digital Twins to downstream services
summary: |
  In this module, you'll learn about how Azure Digital Twins uses event routes to send data to consumers outside the service.
  It's the fun part of this learning path. You can finally start to experience the outcome of the hard work you invested earlier in the form of insights, dashboards, visualizations, and more.
abstract: |
  In this module, you will:
  - Build and simulate the chocolate factory twin.
  - Create a route and filter for twin update notifications.
  - Create and configure an Azure function, and send telemetry messages to an event hub.
  - Create an Azure Time Series Insights instance, and connect it to Azure Digital Twins.
  - Visualize and query your data in Time Series Insights.
prerequisites: |
  - (Recommended.) Introductory knowledge of Azure IoT. You can learn more by completing the [Introduction to Azure IoT](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/introduction-to-azure-iot/) learning path.
  - A basic understanding of the Azure CLI. We recommend that you complete the [Control Azure services with the CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/control-azure-services-with-cli/) module. 
  - [The Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).
    - We recommend that you install the Azure CLI locally. 
    - We don't recommend that you use Azure Cloud Shell. It will time out because of the length of the lab. 
  - PowerShell
    - On Windows, PowerShell is built in.
    - On macOS, you need to install [PowerShell for Mac](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-core-on-macos?view=powershell-6).
  - (For the exercise units.) Access to an Azure subscription in which you have the Global Administrator role for your account and an Azure Active Directory tenant. 
  - (Recommended.) Some experience working with Time Series Insights. You can learn more by completing the [Explore and analyze time-stamped data with Time Series Insights](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/explore-analyze-time-series-insights/) module. 
  - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) to run the device simulator application.
  - [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
  - [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
  - [.NET Core 3.1](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download).
  - [C# Visual Studio Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.csharp).
  - [Azure Functions Visual Studio Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-azurefunctions).
