  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:

  - content: 'What are the fields of a Digital Twins Definition Language (DTDL) interface?'
    choices: 
    - content: '@type, name, schema'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Good guess, but these are the attributes of the contents entry in a model.
    - content: 'Property, Telemetry, Component, Relationship'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Properties are stored data, Telemetry are measurements, Components aid in organization, Relationships include contains, heats, cools, isBilledTo, and so on.
    - content: '@id, @type, @context, displayName, contents'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Good guess, but these are the fields of a model, not the interface.
    - content: 'primitive types, and Object, Map, Enum'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: These are the schema values for model Property, or Telemetry.

  - content: 'What is the difference between a DTDL property and DTDL telemetry?'
    choices: 
    - content: 'There is no significant difference.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Properties and Telemetry are not interchangeable.
    - content: 'Properties are expected to have storage, that can be written to if necessary. Telemetry is a stream of values.'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Typically telemetry is sent by a sensor (temperature, humidity, pressure). Properties might include ID, or date of last maintenance.
    - content: 'Properties do not change, Telemetry changes continuously.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Telemetry might not change, and properties can be set as writable, and written to.
    - content: 'Telemetry is for IoT devices, Properties are for digital twins.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: IoT devices do send telemetry, and properties are an important component of digital twin models. But digital twin models can have telemetry components.

  - content: 'You have a set of models, some of which contain a property called Temperature. Which of the following queries return all models with a temperature less than 65 degrees?'
    choices: 
    - content: 'SELECT * FROM DigitalTwins T WHERE T.Temp < 65'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Close, but Temp is not the correct name of the property.
    - content: 'SELECT * FROM DigitalTwins T WHERE T.Temperature < 65'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: The >, <, = and != are acceptable comparisons in a query.
    - content: 'SELECT * FROM DigitalTwins WHERE IS_DEFINED(Temperature)'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: This query would return all models with a Temperature property.
    - content: 'if (Temperature < 65) return model.name;'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: This answer does not have the right syntax.

  - content: 'What is a distinction between a FROM clause in a SQL-type language and a FROM clause in the Azure Digital Twins query language?'
    choices:
      - content: 'In the ADT query language, you can only have one JOIN statement in the FROM clause, while in a SQL-type language, you can have multiple.'
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: You can use an N amount of JOIN statements following the FROM statement in the ADT query language.
      - content: 'In the ADT query language, each expression in a FROM clause is not a table. Instead, the FROM clause expresses a cross-entity relationship traversal, and is written with an Azure Digital Twins version of JOIN.'
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: This answer is correct. The distinction is that in a SQL-type language, each expression in a FROM clause is a separate table.
      - content: 'In the ADT query language, the FROM clause is used to specify which table to select data from, while in a SQL-type language, each expression in a FROM clause expresses a cross-entity relationship traversal.'
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: This answer is the other way around - in a SQL-type language, the FROM clause is used to specify which table to select data from. While in the ADT query language, each expression in a FROM clause expresses a cross-entity relationship traversal.
