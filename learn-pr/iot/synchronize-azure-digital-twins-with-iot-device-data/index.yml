title: Synchronize Azure Digital Twins with IoT device data
summary: >
  Set up an automatic data flow from a simulated IoT Hub device into Azure Digital Twins. Combine this data with business logic to update digital twin properties.
abstract: | 
  By the end of this module, you'll be able to...
  - Identify which Azure services are used to carry IoT data to Azure Digital Twins
  - Describe the flow of data from a connected IoT device through supportive Azure services into Azure Digital Twins
  - Create Azure functions to define how twins should be updated, based on device data and business logic.
prerequisites: |
  - Understanding of how models, twins, and relationships are used in an Azure Digital Twins solution
  - Experience with programming concepts at the intermediate level
  - [.NET Core](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet)
