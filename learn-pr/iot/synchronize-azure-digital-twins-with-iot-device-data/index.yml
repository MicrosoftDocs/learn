title: Synchronize Azure Digital Twins with IoT device data
summary: Set up an automatic data flow from a simulated IoT Hub device into Azure Digital Twins. Combine this data with business logic to update digital twin properties.
abstract: | 
  By the end of this module, you'll be able to...
  - Identify which Azure services are used to carry IoT data to Azure Digital Twins.
  - Describe the flow of data from a connected IoT device through supportive Azure services into Azure Digital Twins.
  - Create Azure functions to define how twins should be updated, based on device data and business logic.
prerequisites: |
  - Understanding of how models, twins, and relationships are used in an Azure Digital Twins solution.
  - Experience with programming concepts at the intermediate level.
  - An [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free), and permission to manage access to Azure resources in the subscription (or cooperation from someone that does have that permission, who can run some commands on your behalf).
  - [Microsoft Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) with the Azure development workload.
  - [.NET Core](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet).
