  questions:

  - content: 'The sending of temperature and humidity values is called telemetry. What value in the following list could also be considered telemetry?'
    choices:  
    - content: 'Build date of the remote IoT Hub device'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: This date would be a property of the device, not telemetry.
    - content: 'Sensor ID'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: This ID could be a property of the device, or a tag in a device twin.
    - content: 'Heartbeat'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: A heart-rate monitor sends out a heartbeat as its telemetry.

  - content: 'What statement best describes a direct method?'
    choices:  
    - content: 'Direct methods are designed for querying, and automatically synchronizing, with the real IoT Hub device'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: This explanation best describes a device twin.
    - content: 'A direct method is a function on the device that can be invoked by the back-end app'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: The back-end app prepares the parameters, then invokes the direct method.
    - content: 'A direct method runs on the back-end app, updating desired properties for the remote device'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Direct methods run on the device app.
    - content: 'A direct method runs on the device app, without any involvement of the back-end app'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Direct methods do run on the device app, but are triggered from the back-end app.

  - content: "Only one of the following statements is true, which one?"
    choices:  
    - content: 'The name of a direct method in the device app appears as a string in the back-end app.'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: In our sample, 'SetFanState' appears in both apps to identify the direct method.
    - content: 'Device twin tags are data shared with the IoT device.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Tags aren't shared, and are invisible to the device.  
    - content: 'A direct method can contain zero, or one, parameter.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Direct methods include a payload that can contain many parameters.
    - content: 'To create a device twin, a single line of code is required.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Device twins are created by default, no lines of code are required.

  - content: 'What is an IoT Hub device twin?'
    choices:  
    - content: 'A device twin is a copy of the device state information, held on the device itself.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Device twins are stored in the cloud.
    - content: 'Device twins are duplicate hardware devices, in case one device malfunctions.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Duplicating devices may be a sensible approach, but they aren't called IoT Hub device twins.
    - content: 'Device twins are JSON documents that store, in the cloud, device information.'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Azure IoT Hub, by default, maintains a device twin for each device that you connect to IoT Hub. State information includes metadata, configuration settings, and conditions.
