In this module, you learned how to:

- Create a custom Azure IoT Hub, using the Azure portal
- Create a device ID for a custom device, using the Azure portal
- Create an app to simulate a device monitoring a cheese cave
- Create an app to provide a back-end service to listen for the telemetry sent by the device
- Add code to both apps to provide a _direct method_
- Add code to both apps to show the role of _device twins_

## Clean up

When you're satisfied you do not need to return to the CheeseCaveHub, delete the device, then delete the hub. These options are available in your [Azure portal](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#home).

No need to delete your project code though, keep it for future reference!

## Next steps
