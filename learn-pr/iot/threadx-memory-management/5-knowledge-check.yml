  questions:
    - content: 'Why does ThreadX provide primitive data types?'
      choices:
        - content: 'To increase processor speed.'
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. Data types don't increase processor speed."
        - content: 'To ensure portability between C compilers.'
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: 'Correct! Providing primitive data types helps ensure portability between C compilers.'
        - content: 'To reduce data type conflicts.'
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. Using primitive data types doesn't reduce data type conflicts."
    - content: 'Which of these statements is true for a ThreadX memory block pool?'
      choices:
        - content: 'Using a memory block pool might cause fragmentation.'
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: 'Incorrect. Using a memory block pool never results in fragmentation.'
        - content: 'Each memory block is the same size.'
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: 'Correct! Each memory block is the same size in a memory block pool.'
        - content: 'Using a memory block pool is a good way to implement nondeterminism.'
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: 'Incorrect. Using a memory block pool can never result in nondeterminism.'
    - content: 'Which of the following statements is true for a ThreadX stack?'
      choices:
        - content: "There's no minimum size requirements for a stack."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. A stack size that's too small is likely to result in application failure."
        - content: 'The main thread uses the stack to make function calls and to allocate local variables.'
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: 'Incorrect. The compiler uses the stack to make function calls and to temporarily allocate local variables.'
        - content: 'The context of a thread is stored in the thread stack.'
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: 'Correct! In a ThreadX stack, the context of the thread is stored in the thread stack.'
    - content: 'Which of these code structures should you avoid in a thread entry function?'
      choices:
        - content: 'Recursive algorithms.'
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: 'Correct! You should avoid using recursive algorithms in a thread entry function.'
        - content: 'Infinite loops.'
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: 'Incorrect. Most thread entry functions are infinite loops.'
        - content: 'If statements.'
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: 'Incorrect. No problems result from using if statements in a thread entry function.'
    - content: 'What would happen if a thread requested 100 bytes from a memory byte pool, but no memory was available?'
      choices:
        - content: 'The thread probably would suspend.'
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: 'Correct! The thread probably would suspend.'
        - content: 'Memory would be taken from a previous allocation.'
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. Memory wouldn't be taken from a previous allocation."
        - content: 'The scheduler would add more memory to the byte pool.'
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: 'Incorrect. No memory would be added in this scenario.'
