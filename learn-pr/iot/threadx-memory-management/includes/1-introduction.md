## Introduction

Have you wondered about the memory management options that Azure RTOS ThreadX (ThreadX) offers you? If so, you've come to the right place.

Most ThreadX resources require the allocation of memory space when those resources are created. For example, when a thread is created, memory space for its stack must be provided. ThreadX provides two memory management techniques. You can choose one of these techniques, or any other method, to allocate memory space.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you will:

- View a summary of ThreadX services.
- Learn about ThreadX primitive data types and service data types.
- Learn about ThreadX memory byte pools.
- Learn about ThreadX memory block pools.
- Learn about memory allocation for thread stacks.

When you complete this module, you'll be well on your way to exploring additional ThreadX services and how to apply them in a project.
