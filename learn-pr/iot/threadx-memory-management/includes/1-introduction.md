## Overview

Have you wondered about the memory management options that Azure RTOS ThreadX (ThreadX) offers you? If so, you've come to the right place.

Most ThreadX resources require the allocation of memory space when those resources are created. For example, when a thread is created, memory space for its stack must be provided. ThreadX provides two memory management techniques. You can choose one of these techniques, or any other method, to allocate memory space.
