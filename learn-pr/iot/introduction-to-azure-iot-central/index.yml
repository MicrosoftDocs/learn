### Summary
###
### Length:
###   - Write 2 sentences.
###   - Total length should be 20-25 words; up to 35 is acceptable.
###   - To keep it brief, avoid teaching, omit motivation, and remove "learn", "in this module", and title words.
###
### Sentence 1:
###   Goal: List key features of the product covered here. Omit less-important parts or group low-level parts into one higher-level element.
###   Pattern: "Describe the <list of covered features> that <perform the key product use-case>."
###   Example 1: "Describe the function of <connectors, triggers, and actions> and show how you <combine them to create an app>."
###   Example 2: "Survey GitHub <notifications, branches, commits, and pull requests> that help you <collaborate, build, and deploy software>."
###
### Sentence 2:
###   Goal: Describe how the module will achieve the 'evaluate' task.
###   Pattern: "Characterize the types of <problem> that <product> can <solve>".
###   Example 1: "Characterize the types of <business processes> that <Logic Apps> can <automate>."
###   Example 2: "Determine the types of <software projects> for which <GitHub> is a <good development platform>."
###

###
summary: "Describe how Azure IoT Central can help you collect, monitor, and analyze IoT data. Determine the types of IoT solutions Azure IoT Central can be used to implement."

### Learning Objectives
###
### Write 2 Learning Objectives, one that fits each pattern shown below.
###
### Learning Objective 1:
###   Goal: Express that 'evaluate' is the terminal learning objective of an "Introduction to <product>" module.
###   Pattern: "Evaluate whether <product> is right for <general-type-of-problem-solved-by-product>."
###   Example: "Evaluate whether <Logic Apps> is appropriate to <automate your business processes>."
###
### Learning Objective 2:
###   Goal: Express that the learner will be able to describe how the product works to perform a task.
###   Pattern: "Describe how <feature(s)> of <product> <solve problem>."
###   Example: "Describe how <the components> of a <Logic App> work together to <launch your app and implement your business logic>."
###
### Notes:
###   - The YAML element name here is 'abstract' but it must contain your Learning Objectives.
###   - Do not edit the lead-in sentence ("By the end of this module, you'll be able to:").
###   - Start each objective with an upper-case letter.
###   - End each objective with a period.
###
### Detailed guidance: https://review.docs.microsoft.com/help/learn/id-guidance-learning-objectives?branch=master
###
