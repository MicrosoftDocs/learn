      explanation: "Correct. Azure Maps provides map capabilities to Azure IoT Central using secure geo-spatial services, APIs and SDKs in Azure."
    - content: "Azure Stream Analytics"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Azure Stream Analytics enables real time insights from data streams sent from IoT devices."
  - content: "What is the responsibility of the Operator user role in Azure IoT Central?"
    choices:
    - content: "Builds IoT solutions in the cloud"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The Solution Builder builds the IoT solution that devices connect to."
    - content: "Creates user roles and assigns their permissions"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Administrators handle administrative tasks such as creating users and assigning roles and permissions."
    - content: "Manages IoT devices connected to Azure IoT Central"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The Operator is responsible for managing IoT devices connected to Azure IoT Central."
  - content: "A small tech startup has plans to develop a line of tracking devices. Due to budget limitations, they aren't able to hire experienced IoT professionals. The startup wants an IoT solution that allows them to quickly provision their devices with little to no code. One of their senior developers doesn't believe Azure IoT Central will work. Is this senior developer correct?"
    choices:
    - content: "Yes. All Azure IoT Central solutions require code to be written both in the cloud and on the devices."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Azure IoT Central solutions don't require code to be written for both the cloud and devices."
    - content: "Yes. Azure IoT Central solutions always require users to write code for the cloud application to function."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Azure IoT Central cloud applications are built to function \"right out of the box\"."
    - content: "No. Azure IoT Central has an IoT Plug and Play feature that lets users build solutions without writing any code."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The IoT Plug and Play feature in Azure IoT Central enables solution builders to build production-ready solutions without writing code for the cloud or device."
  - content: "A warehouse owner wants to automate their inventory management system. The owner would like to place sensors on each shelf of the warehouse to monitor item availability and programmatically replenish low inventory. The warehouse's IT department is in search of an IoT solution that will allow them to securely place orders to replenish low inventory. Which of the following benefits of Azure IoT Central makes this possible?"
    choices:
    - content: "Big Data Management"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Big Data Management refers to how the IoT application will handle its data but doesn't adequately secure the data it handles."
    - content: "Device Management"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Device Management refers to the systematic pattern used to handle devices themselves; not their security."
    - content: "Security & Compliance"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Azure IoT Central's Security & Compliance features allow builders to create a secure IoT solution, including secure communication between devices and the cloud."
  - content: "An online retail company is planning for their biggest annual sale. They have built an IoT solution using Azure IoT Central that will help them monitor inventory in each of their warehouses to ensure product availability during the sale. A tropical storm warning has been issued for the region where their Azure resources have been deployed. The IT department isn't worried at all. Why are they confident that their site won't experience any interruptions if a regional datacenter outage occurs?"
    choices:
    - content: "Azure IoT Central's high availability & disaster recovery benefits will ensure their application continues to function in the event of a regional outage."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. High availability & disaster recovery are benefits of using Azure cloud services. SLAs guarantee an uptime of close to 100% and application backups can be used for restorations, if needed."
    - content: "Azure DevOps will allow the company to redeploy their application to datacenters affected by outages and immediately restore services."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Azure DevOps can be used to deploy code; however, if a datacenter is experiencing an outage, a deployment to that datacenter won't guarantee availability of the deployed code."
    - content: "Scaling gives the company enough compute power to overcome the outage."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Scaling refers to adding additional resources or power for cloud services but can't ensure availability of cloud services."
