Most IoT solutions require methods for automating device management tasks that can be applied to large groups of IoT devices based on solution parameters. Azure IoT Hub includes automated device management at scale features that can handle up to millions of IoT devices.

Suppose you have joined a development team that is implementing a warehouse product inventory tracking solution for a large national retailer. The company needs your team to manage the thousands of IoT devices that have been deployed in product inventory warehouses across the country. Understanding how to automate device management for large numbers of devices using Azure IoT Hub helps to ensure that the team is ready to manage the IoT devices that your company has deployed. You decide to examine the approaches to IoT Hub device management at scale.

In this module, you will:

- Examine how to use IoT Hub jobs for device management.
- Examine IoT Hub automatic device management.
- Examine IoT Hub device management best practices.

By the end of this module, you will be able to describe the approaches to device management in bulk.
