Azure IoT Hub developers may be called upon to complete many different types of device provisioning tasks in support of the deployment lifecycle.

Suppose you joined a team that is implementing an Azure IoT Hub solution for the company. The company is provisioning and deploying of thousands of devices using the Azure IoT Hub Device Provisioning Service. Understanding the tasks associated with the deployment lifecycle helps to ensure that the team is ready to fulfill their responsibilities. You decide to examine the tasks that must be completed in order to securely provision and deprovision devices.

In this module, you will:

* Review the device enrollment tools and processes.
* Examine how to configure and use certificates within the provisioning lifecycle.
* Examine the deprovisioning and disenrollment processes.
* Examine how to provision for multi-tenancy scenarios.

By the end of this module, you will be able to describe tasks that you need to implement in support of the deployment lifecycle.
