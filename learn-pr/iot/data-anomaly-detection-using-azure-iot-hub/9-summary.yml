  questions:

  - content: 'Conveyor belt vibration is measured in what units?'
    choices:  
    - content: 'pressure'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Pressure sensors don't measure vibration.
    - content: 'decibels'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Sound vibrations could be measured in decibels, but, realistically, not conveyor belts.
    - content: 'velocity'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Vibration is a bit more complex than a simple velocity.
    - content: 'acceleration'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: The two common units of vibration are acceleration in m/s<sup>2</sup>, or in g-forces.

  - content: 'An IoT Hub name must be unique across what space?'
    choices:  
    - content: 'The worldwide web'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: The IoT Hub name forms the unique part of the Azure URL, so must be unique across the web.
    - content: 'Your Azure resources'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: The name needs to be unique across a wider space than just your resources.
    - content: 'All Azure resources'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: The name needs to be unique across a wider space than all Azure resources.
    - content: 'All Azure IoT Hub names'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: The name needs to be unique across a wider space than all Azure IoT Hub names.

  - content: 'How did our sample C# device app warn the operator if the conveyor belt stopped for more than 5 seconds?'
    choices:  
    - content: 'As an entry in the message data'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: An alert could be sent this way. However, our app doesn't use this approach.
    - content: 'As a property named beltAlert, with a value set to true if the condition was met'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Properties can be simple, such as device IDs, or more complex types such as conditional alerts.
    - content: 'By setting off an alarm'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: A remote operator will probably not hear the alarm.
    - content: 'As a separate warning message, with an HTTP code of 400'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: There's no need to send a separate message, alerts can be added to a message as message data, or as a message property.
  
  - content: 'What is the purpose of Azure Event Hubs?'
    choices:  
    - content: 'Azure Event Hubs is a central message hub, for bi-directional communications with remote devices.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Bi-directional communications is the role of an IoT Hub.
    - content: 'Azure Event Hubs is a fully managed service to move certain workloads to the edge of the network.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Moving work to the edge of the network is the role of Azure IoT Edge.
    - content: 'Azure Event Hubs is a data streaming platform and event ingestion service. It can receive and process millions of events per second.'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: The processed event data can be stored, run through Azure Stream Analytics, and other cloud processes.
    - content: 'Azure Event Hubs is a real-time analytics service, designed for demanding workloads.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Analyzing demanding streaming workloads is the role of Azure Stream Analytics.

  - content: 'Streaming input to an Azure Stream Analytics job can come from three sources, which three?'
    choices:  
    - content: 'IoT Hub message route, Event Hub, Blob storage'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: A message route doesn't define streaming input.
    - content: 'Event Hub, Blob storage, SQL query'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: The SQL query provides the processing for the job, not one of its inputs.
    - content: 'IoT Hub, Event Hub, Blob storage'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: These three options appear in the Add Stream input drop-down list.
    - content: 'BI dashboard, BI dataset, IoT Hub message route'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: None of these features are streaming inputs.
