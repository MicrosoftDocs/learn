  questions:
    - content: 'How many threads leave suspension when the specified event flags are satisfied?'
      choices:
        - content: '2'
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. All suspended threads that satisfy the specified event flags leave suspension."
        - content: '32'
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. All suspended threads that satisfy the specified event flags leave suspension."
        - content: 'All suspended threads that satisfy the specified event flags leave suspension.'
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: 'Correct! All suspended threads that satisfy the specified event flags leave suspension.'
    - content: 'At what point in time is an event flags group initialized to zero?'
      choices:
        - content: 'When the event flags group is created'
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: 'Correct! An event flags group is initialized to zero when the event flags group is created.'
        - content: 'When the first get operation occurs'
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. An event flags group isn't initialized to zero when the first get operation occurs."
        - content: 'When the event flags group is satisfied'
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. An event flags group isn't initialized to zero when the event flags group is satisfied."
    - content: 'Which of the following ThreadX service calls will always succeed?'
      choices:
        - content: 'tx_event_flags_set(&my_flags, 0x101, TX_OR);'
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: 'Correct! The service call tx_event_flags_set(&my_flags, 0x101, TX_OR); always succeeds.'
        - content: 'tx_event_flags_get(&my_flags, 0x110, TX_OR, &actual_TX_WAIT_FOREVER);'
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. This ThreadX service call doesn't always succeed."
        - content: 'tx_event_flags_get(&my_flags, 0x110, TX_AND_CLEAR, &actual_TX_WAIT_FOREVER);'
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. This ThreadX service call doesn't always succeed."
    - content: 'Suppose that the event flags group contains 0x111. What is the result of this valid service call: tx_event_flags_set(&my_flags, 0x101, TX_AND);'
      choices:
        - content: 'The new value of the event flags group is 0x111.'
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. The new value of the event flags group isn't 0x111 as a result of this service call."
        - content: 'The new value of the event flags group is 0x101.'
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: 'Correct! The new value of the event flags group is 0x101.'
        - content: 'The new value of the event flags group is 0x010.'
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. The new value of the event flags group isn't 0x010 as a result of this service call."
    - content: 'Suppose that the event flags group contains 0x101. What is the result of this valid service call: tx_event_flags_get(&my_flags, 0x101, TX_OR_CLEAR, &actual, TX_WAIT_FOREVER);'
      choices:
        - content: 'The specified flags are satisfied and the new value of the event flags group is 0x101.'
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. The new value of the event flags group isn't 0x101 as a result of this service call."
        - content: 'The specified flags are satisfied and the new value of the event flags group is 0x100'
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. The new value of the event flags group isn't 0x100 as a result of this service call."
        - content: 'The specified flags are satisfied and the new value of the event flags group is 0x000.'
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: 'Correct! The specified flags are satisfied and the new value of the event flags group is 0x000.'
