title: Azure RTOS ThreadX — Analyze thread behavior with timing facilities
summary: Now that you have created your first Hello World project, have you thought about analyzing the behavior of your system? If so, this is the module you should investigate.
abstract: |
  In this module, you will:
  - Explore the features and uses of Application Timers and the Thread Info Get services.
  - Review the purpose of the internal system clock.
  - Obtain a better understanding of the behavior of the Hello World project and modify some of its code.
  - Use the internal system clock function to collect timing data for each cycle of the activities performed by the two threads.
  - Use an Application Timer to compute and display the total number of cycles each thread completed, the average time for each cycle, and selected values provided by the thread_performance_info_get service.
  - Design and debug the ThreadX solution using a hands-on approach with GitHub Codespace or Visual Studio.
