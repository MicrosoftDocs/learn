  questions:

  - content: 'Why do we need an Azure Maps account for this module?'
    choices: 
    - content: 'To enter the location of the truck on a map'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: The location of the truck is handled by the IoT Central dashboard.
    - content: 'To calculate the best route from one location to another'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. Azure Maps enables many route finding options.
    - content: 'To display a map background'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: We don't render any particular background in this module.

  - content: 'What three Azure resources can IoT Central continuous data be exported to?'
    choices: 
    - content: 'Blob storage, IoT Hub, and Service Queue'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Only one of these three resources is correct.
    - content: 'Blob storage, Service Bus, and IoT Hub'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Two of these resources are correct.
    - content: 'Azure Cosmos DB storage, Service Queue, and IoT Hub'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: None of these resources is correct.
    - content: 'Blob storage, Service Bus, and Event Hubs'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. You use Blob storage for a cold path, and Service Bus or Event Hubs for a warm path.
      
  - content: 'What is one of the key differences between sending data to Blob storage and sending it to either Service Bus or Event Hubs?'
    choices: 
    - content: 'When it comes to sending data, there is no real difference.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: There's a difference, Blob storage doesn't make the best warm path.
    - content: 'When you send data to Blob storage, all changes are submitted once per minute. Service Bus and Event Hubs receive data in near real time.'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. You use Blob storage for a cold path, and Service Bus or Event Hubs for a warm path.
    - content: 'For Blob storage, all the telemetry and device data is sent. For the other two services, only a subset of telemetry data is sent.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: All three services receive comprehensive and complete data.
    - content: "Blob storage receives data in the JSON format, and the other services do not."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: All of the services receive data in the JSON format.

  - content: 'Which of the following statements is false?'
    choices: 
    - content: 'You can export data to Blob storage, Service Bus, or Event Hubs only if the data is in the same Azure subscription as the IoT Central app.'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. You can send data to other subscriptions by entering a connection string, so this statement is false. 
    - content: 'For warm-path analysis, data can be sent to trigger custom rules in Azure Stream Analytics, trigger custom flows in Azure Logic Apps, or pass through Azure Functions for transformation.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: This statement is true, and it describes good uses of the warm continuous data paths.
    - content: 'Good uses of sending data to Blob storage include cold-path analytics, such as Azure Machine Learning models, long-term trend analysis, or archiving.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: This statement is true, and it describes good uses of the cold continuous data paths.
    - content: 'Blob storage, Service Bus, and Event Hubs all receive data in the JSON format.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: This statement is true. The JSON format is used extensively within Azure IoT.

  - content: 'Which of the following statements is false?'
    choices: 
    - content: 'Data sent to Azure Blob storage can be routed to Azure Machine Learning, to train the learning models.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: This statement is true.
    - content: 'Azure Service Bus is a good service for enterprise-level message routing.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: This statement is true.
    - content: 'When an IoT Central data export service is created, data is automatically routed to it. '
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: The statement is true, as long as the Enabled setting is On, which it is by default.
    - content: 'Event Hubs is a good gateway for an event pipeline.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: This statement is true.  
    - content: 'The option to create a container within a Blob storage resource is optional, for data export purposes.'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. A container is required, so this statement is false.

  - content: 'What are the different types of apps in Power Apps?'
    choices: 
    - content: 'Canvas apps and model-driven apps'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: There are three types of apps in Power Apps.
    - content: 'Canvas apps, model-driven apps, and mobile apps'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Mobile app isn't the name of a supported type.
    - content: 'Canvas apps, model-driven apps, and portals'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. These are the three types of apps in Power Apps.
    - content: 'Phone apps, tablet apps, and web portal apps'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: There's a portal app type, but the other two are not associated with Power Apps.

  - content: 'In IoT Central data export, you get to choose which data runs continuously. What are the options?'

    - content: 'Devices, device templates, and telemetry'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. You select devices, device templates, and telemetry in the "Create data export" pane.
    - content: 'Telemetry and devices'
