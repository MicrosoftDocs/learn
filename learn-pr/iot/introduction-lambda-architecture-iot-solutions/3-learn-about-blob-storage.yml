  questions:

  - content: 'What answer best describes lambda architecture?'
    choices:  
    - content: 'Lambda architecture supports multiple outputs from a message data source.  Typically, a real-time stream for quick analysis, and batch processing for bulk operations.'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Lambda architecture is indeed a hybrid approach.
    - content: 'Lambda architecture prioritizes speed over batch processing, enabling quick queries and responses.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Lambda architecture doesn't prioritize one form of processing over the other.
    - content: 'Lambda architecture batch processes large quantities of data, enabling a complete analysis, though with some latency.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Lambda architecture can also include a real-time processing stream.

  - content: 'Blob storage by default is general purpose, but it can be set to one of three specific roles?'
    choices:  
    - content: 'Append blobs, Big blobs, Data Lake storage'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Only Append blobs in this list is correct.
    - content: 'Append blobs, Block blobs, Hot blobs'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Blobs are storage, and can't be hot or cold.
    - content: 'Append blobs, Cosmos DB blobs, Data lake blobs'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Cosmos DB isn't blob storage.
    - content: 'Append blobs, Page blobs, Block blobs'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Append blobs for logging, Page blobs for read/write access, Block blobs for big data.
