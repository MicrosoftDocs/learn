You've constructed the prototype device and written the console app that drives it. Now, it's time to deploy your app to the device.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Ensure your Raspberry Pi is configured as described in the *Introduction* unit. The SSH service must be enabled for secure shell access from your development machine. The `I2C` service must be enabled to allow your code to access the I<sup>2</sup>C bus. Ensure your Raspberry Pi is connected to your network via WiFi or Ethernet.

## Deployment types

.NET provides two publishing modes: **framework-dependent** and **self-contained**. In a framework-dependent deployment, the app relies on an installation of the .NET runtime on the target device. In a self-contained deployment, the app includes all of the .NET runtime dependencies with the compiled assemblies. There are advantages to each approach. For this module, you'll deploy your app as a self-contained app.

## Create a destination directory on the Raspberry Pi

Complete the following steps *in a new terminal window*:

1. Open a secure shell session to your Raspberry Pi.

    ```bash
    ssh pi@raspberrypi
    ```

    In the preceding command:

    - `ssh` is the command to launch OpenSSH.
    - `pi` is the username on the Raspberry Pi.
    - `raspberrypi` is the host name for the Raspberry Pi. If you've changed the host name on your device, use the device's host name or IP address.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Most modern operating systems have OpenSSH preinstalled. If the `ssh` command doesn't resolve, install OpenSSH.

1. In the SSH session, create a directory named *cheesecave.net* in the home directory. Switch to the new directory.

    ```bash
    mkdir cheesecave.net
    cd cheesecave.net
    ```

    Your current location is *~/cheesecave.net*.

## Publish a self-contained app to the Raspberry Pi

Complete the following steps *in the original terminal window on your development machine*:

1. Publish the app as a self-contained app.

    ```dotnetcli
    dotnet publish --runtime linux-arm64 --self-contained
    ```

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > This assumes you're using the recommended 64-bit OS. If you're using a 32-bit version of Raspberry Pi OS, use `--runtime linux-arm` in the preceding command to target the correct OS.

    The preceding command creates a directory with the files required for a self-contained deployment for the `linux-arm64` runtime. Take note of the location of the *publish* folder.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/dotnet-publish.png" alt-text="A screenshot of a terminal session showing the output from dotnet publish." lightbox="../media/dotnet-publish.png":::

1. Copy the files from the *publish* folder to the deployment location on the Raspberry Pi.

    ```bash
    scp ./bin/Debug/net7.0/linux-arm64/publish/* pi@raspberrypi:~/cheesecave.net
    ```

    In the preceding command:

    - `scp` is the secure file copy command included with OpenSSH.
    - `./bin/Debug/net7.0/linux-arm64/publish/*` specifies the files to be copied. In this case, every file in the `./bin/Debug/net7.0/linux-arm64/publish/` directory is included. Enter the correct path if you're using a different version of the .NET SDK or are targeting `linux-arm`, as the path will be different.
    - `pi@raspberrypi:~/cheesecave.net` is the destination.
        - `pi@raspberrypi` is the username and host name, as before.
        - `~/cheesecave.net` is the location on the Raspberry Pi where the files will be copied to.

## Grant execute permissions

In Linux-based operating systems like Raspberry Pi OS, binary files aren't allowed to execute until they've been marked as executable in the file system.

**In the SSH session on the Raspberry Pi**, execute the following command:

```bash
chmod +x ./cheesecave.net
```

The `cheesecave.net` executable file now has permission to execute.

In the next unit, you'll test the code on your device.
