Your team is responsible for monitoring IoT Hub and troubleshooting device connection and communication issues for the company's IoT solution.

In this module, you learned how to configure IoT Hub monitoring diagnostics, metrics, alerts, and logging.

If you hadn't research IoT Hub monitoring, you wouldn't be prepared to create a IoT Hub monitoring proof-of-concept.

The experience that you gained by configuring IoT Hub monitoring, alerts, and logging in a test environment enabled you to create a monitoring proof-of-concept that can be reviewed with your IT team.
