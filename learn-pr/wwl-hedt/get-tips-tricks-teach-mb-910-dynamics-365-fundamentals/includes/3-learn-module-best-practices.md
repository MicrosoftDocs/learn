Skilling our future generations is important, and the MB-910: Microsoft Dynamics 365 Fundamentals (CRM) course aims to be accessible to everyone and anyone. This may be your students' first introduction to a CRM, and these courses serve as a foundation for some of our more advanced courses. We’re just going to start with the basics.

Before we begin, make sure you use the most up-to-date version of the Microsoft Official Curriculum (MOC). It's recommended that you log into the [Learning Download Center](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/mctnews/current-courseware-downloading-process/4196123) (LDC) at least quarterly. If you haven't already done so, download the course materials from the LDC before continuing in this learning path.
