As we begin to teach students worldwide about Microsoft technologies and solutions, we must include students with diverse learning needs. More than 1 billion people around the world have a disability. While some disabilities may be visually apparent, others may not be, and at some point in our lives, many of us may experience a disability, whether itâ€™s temporary or permanent. Microsoft is proudly designing technologies with [built-in accessibility tools](https://aka.ms/microsoftaccessibility) and features. 

We encourage you to create a digitally diverse learning community with bias-free communication and inclusive design methodology by accommodating students' diverse needs around: 

- Hearing 

- Mobility 

- Vision 

- Neurodiversity
