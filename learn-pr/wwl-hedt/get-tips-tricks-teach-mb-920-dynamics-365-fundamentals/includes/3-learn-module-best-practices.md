Skilling our future generations is important, and the MB-920: Microsoft Dynamics 365 Fundamentals (ERP) course aims to be accessible to everyone and anyone. This may be your students' first introduction to the enterprise resource planning world, and these courses serve as a foundation for some of our more advanced courses. We’re just going to start with the basics.
Before we begin, make sure you use the most up-to-date version of the Microsoft Official Curriculum. It's recommended that you log into the Learning Download Center (LDC) at least quarterly. If you haven't already done so, please download the course materials from the LDC before continuing in this learning path.
