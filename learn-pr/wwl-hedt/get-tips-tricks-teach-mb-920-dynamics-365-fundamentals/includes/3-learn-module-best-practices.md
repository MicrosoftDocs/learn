Skilling our future generations is important, and the MB-920: Microsoft Dynamics 365 Fundamentals (ERP) course aims to be accessible to everyone and anyone.

We’re just going to start with the basics.

If you haven't already done so, please download the course materials from the LDC before continuing in this learning path.
