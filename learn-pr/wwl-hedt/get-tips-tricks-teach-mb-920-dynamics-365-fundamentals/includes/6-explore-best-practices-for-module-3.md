MB-920: Module 3 Learn the Fundamentals of Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management

Module 3 Overview

As you begin to teach this module, get familiar with what the students will learn during the module. This module is a very content-heavy module where students will learn about supply chain management in Dynamics 365. With a content heavy module, we recommend using different modalities in your delivery to keep your class engaged.

This module consists of three lessons:

- Lesson 1 – Identify general capabilities of Microsoft Dynamics 365 supply chain management
- Lesson 2 – Explore warehouse and inventory management capabilities in Microsoft Dynamics 365 supply chain management

Module 3 Tips and Tricks

- Describe the features within Product Information Management as well as trade agreements and discounts
- Explain the capabilities to control day-to-day operations of a warehouse, costing methods, warehouse configuration options, and inventory management
- Describe the capabilities to implement manufacturing strategies and tools used to manage the shop floor
- Since this is a content heavy module consider using different modalities to keep your class engaged. One way to keep your class engaged is to cover no more than 10 minutes of theory, then do a lab, and ask your class an interactive question. We recommend keeping the pace of the class moving to keep your students’ focus
