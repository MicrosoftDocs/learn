During Module 2: Onboarding on-demand, we talked about the importance of early planning to decide how you're going to teach the materials and certify your students. Where your institution is in the process of adopting industry-recognized technical certifications as a part of your curriculum will determine whether you take a course-level or a program-level approach. We’ve developed a Learning Path to help you select the approach that makes sense for your course or institution. The Microsoft Learning Path [Implement certifications in academic programs](https://aka.ms/implementationLP) will introduce you to different approaches for implementing a certification at the course and program level. 

You can also review the “Curriculum Planning” folder in the [Microsoft Learning Download Center](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/mctnews/current-courseware-downloading-process/4196123) for more information about each approach.

You can tailor the student journey for any Microsoft courses to best fit your delivery schedule and available resources, creating a positive experience for your learners. These are the main implementation approaches we’ve observed that can be applied to each course. As an educator you can choose to adopt and modify any approach for your needs: 

The course level approach: 

- Implement as a standalone course 

- Integrate alongside a course (an extra curricular course) 

- Integrate inside a course (a lesson in a related course) 

Program-level approach: 

- Develop a new program (for example, degree, diploma, etc.) 

- Integrate with an existing program (for example, degree, diploma, etc.) 

It's recommended that you refer to the other teaching materials provided in the [Microsoft Learning Download Center](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/mctnews/current-courseware-downloading-process/4196123). In particular, the Course Datasheet and the Educator Teaching Guide will help to inform the overall integration approach that is appropriate for your delivery plans.
