Microsoft provides tools to integrate content from Microsoft Learn into your institution’s Learning Management System (LMS). The Learning Tools Interoperability (LTI) application enables institutions to embed modules and pathways from the Microsoft Learn catalog and display them within an institution's LMS (e.g., [Blackboard](https://aka.ms/LTIBBdemo), [Canvas](https://aka.ms/LTICdemo) and [Moodle](https://aka.ms/LTIMdemo)). Find more information on [Microsoft Learn Catalog LTI Provider](https://aka.ms/MSLTI).
