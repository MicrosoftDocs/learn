Now that you've seen the `if` statement and the looping
constructs in the C# language, see if you can write C# code to
find the sum of all integers 1 through 20 that are divisible
by 3.  Here are a few hints:

- The `%` operator gives you the remainder of a division operation.
- The `if` statement gives you the condition to see if a number should be part of the sum.
- The `for` loop can help you repeat a series of steps for all the numbers 1 through 20.

Try it yourself. Then check how you did. As a hint, you should get 63 for an answer.
