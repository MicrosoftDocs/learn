    You've completed the list quickstart. This quickstart is the final interactive quickstart. You can continue these quickstarts on your own development environment. Learn the basics of [local development](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/csharp/quick-starts/local-environment) and then pick a quickstart. You can try this same exercise, move directly to the next quickstart, or start again at with the [numbers in C#](numbers-in-csharp.yml) quickstart. You can learn more about working with the `List` type in the
    [.NET Guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/standard) topic on [collections](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/quick-starts/arrays-and-collections). You'll also learn about other collection types.
