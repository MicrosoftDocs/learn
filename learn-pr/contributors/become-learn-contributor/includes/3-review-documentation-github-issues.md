One of the most useful ways to contribute to Microsoft Learn is to give feedback directly on a documentation article. Using the feedback link on the page, you can provide edits, suggestions, questions, or other insights as they come up in your browsing. Since most Microsoft Learn documentation content is stored in GitHub repositories, you can provide your feedback using a GitHub process called submitting a GitHub Issue. 

An Issue in GitHub is a tool that enables technology users, engineers, and other Microsoft Learn visitors to share and track feedback on a specific article. You fill out a form to document your feedback and post it to the source article’s repository in GitHub, where an author or owner will be notified. Anyone who visits the GitHub repository can see Issues. They serve as a helpful way to collect and store valuable feedback, like reporting bugs, feature requests, or notes. 

## Why review content in GitHub?

Providing content reviews on GitHub is a direct way to contribute to a topic you’re passionate or knowledgeable about. This means you can add your ideas as you’re exploring a topic on Microsoft documentation. Contributing your insights to the pool of knowledge helps improve Microsoft product experiences for millions of other users. Your feedback advances content for other Microsoft Learn visitors who rely on Microsoft products and their supporting content.

In most cases, submitting GitHub feedback enables you to send your ideas to the team in charge of the product’s content set. This collaboration pathway between content teams and product users allows feedback to be shared and discussed directly in GitHub. 

Contributing to documentation content can provide professional benefits to you as well. GitHub is a well-known platform where technical contributions can be made and tracked. Each time you contribute to a project on GitHub, it’s reflected in your GitHub profile. Over time, you can build a record of your contributions to add to your technical portfolio.
