You're an administrator for an architecture firm. The firm stores computer-aided design (CAD) files locally on a Windows Server file share. These CAD files are so large that your on-premises file share is nearly at capacity. The organization needs quick access to the CAD files that are used most frequently. The system can tolerate some network latency for the files that are used less frequently. You've been asked to investigate how you can extend your file share capacity by using Azure.

## Learning objectives

- Deploy Azure File Sync.
- Test that the file sync is working.
