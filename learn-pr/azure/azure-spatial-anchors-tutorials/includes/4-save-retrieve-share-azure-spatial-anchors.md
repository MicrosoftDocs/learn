Azure Spatial Anchors enable you to share anchors in the world across many devices. It works with various development environments. We can share the Azure Anchor ID between multiple devices By saving the Anchor ID to the local disc on HoloLens. We can achieve spatial alignment across multiple app sessions.

## Spatial placements

Spatial mapping provides applications with the opportunity to present natural and familiar forms of interaction to the user; what could be more natural than placing down your phone on the desk?

Constraining the placement of holograms (or more generally, any selection of spatial locations) to lie on surfaces provides a natural mapping from 3D (point in space) to 2D (point on surface). This reduces the amount of information the user needs to provide to the application and makes the user's interactions faster, easier, and more precise.
