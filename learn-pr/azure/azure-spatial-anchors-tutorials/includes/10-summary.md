In these Azure Spatial Anchors tutorials, you learned the fundamentals. You explored various steps required to start and stop an Azure Spatial Anchors session. Also, to create, upload, and download Azure Spatial Anchors on a single device.

Later you learned how to persist Azure Spatial Anchors between app sessions and app restarts by saving the Azure Spatial Anchor ID to the local disk on HoloLens. You also learned to share Azure Spatial Anchors between multiple devices for a basic multi-user, static hologram shared experience. You learned to create a UI panel that displays the current status of the Azure Spatial Anchors and provided an opportunity for users to provide real-time feedback.
In the end, you learned how to build your project to Android and iOS devices using AR Foundation, ARCore XR Plugin, and ARKit XR Plugin.

## Next steps
