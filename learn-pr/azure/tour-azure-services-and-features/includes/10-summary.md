We have covered a lot of ground in this module. 

- You have seen some of the core products in Azure across the main service pillars.
- You have learned how to create a free account for Microsoft Azure and how to sign in using that account. 
- You reviewed the features of the Azure portal and its customization options. 
- You created, customized, and shared a dashboard.

However, this is just the beginning. Azure has so much to offer you, no matter what role you plan in your organization. If you are a developer, Azure provides an easy way to test new platforms and build sophisticated apps. If you are an administrator, you will use the Azure portal, Azure CLI, or Azure PowerShell tools to administer your cloud-based infrastructure. If you are an architect, you can use Azure to test out new architecture ideas quickly.
