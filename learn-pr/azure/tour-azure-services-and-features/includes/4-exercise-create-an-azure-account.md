To create and use Azure services, you will eventually need an account. If you already have an Azure account, or if you aren't ready to create one now, you can skip this unit and move onto the next unit where we will begin to explore the Azure Portal.

> [!NOTE]
> You need a valid credit card for age and identity validation only. Your card will _not be charged_ until you decide to upgrade the trial / free account to a full subscription.

## Sign up for a free account

1. In a web browser, navigate to [azure.microsoft.com](https://azure.microsoft.com?azure-portal=true), and click **Free Account**.

1. On the **Create your Azure free account today** page, click **Start free >** button. 

1. You'll be prompted to sign in with your Microsoft account. Sign in with your Microsoft credentials or create a new free Microsoft account.

1. On the **About you** page, select your correct country or region, and then enter your first and last names, along with your email address and phone number. Depending on your country, you may see additional fields, such as VAT number. Click **Next** to continue.

1. On the **Identity verification by phone** screen, select your country code, and type the number of a telephone to which you have immediate access.

1. You have the option of text or callback to obtain a verification code. Click the relevant button, type the code in the **Verification code** box, and click **Verify code**.

1. If the verification code is correct, you will now be asked to enter details of a valid credit card. Enter the card number, the expiration date, the CVV number, your name as it is written on the card, the address to which the card is registered, along with the postal or ZIP code, and then click **Next**.

1. Finally, check the box to accept the subscription agreement, privacy statement, and communications policy. The second checkbox is optional. Now click **Sign up**.

You have now successfully set up a free account, and you will be taken to the Azure portal home page. Let's explore that next.
