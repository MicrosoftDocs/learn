The Azure Toolkit for IntelliJ makes it easy to deploy a Java web app to Azure App Service.

Suppose you've been hired as a new developer for a manufacturing company that uses IntelliJ IDEA as its development environment. Your organization's customer-facing website, which wholesalers can use to order stock, is written in Java Server Pages (JSP) and your developers use IntelliJ IDEA as their IDE. Your company has used an on-premises web server in the past, but they'd like to move their website to Azure App Service to reduce their costs and increase reliability. With that in mind, your development lead has tasked you with researching the steps necessary to publish web apps to Azure while preserving your existing development environment as much as possible.

By the end of this module, you'll be able to use Azure to host your Java web app and deploy it from within IntelliJ IDEA.
