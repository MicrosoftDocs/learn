Containers are an Operating System virtualization technology that offers a lightweight solution for packaging and deploying software applications. In a container, an application and all its dependencies are bundled together in an isolated environment, providing a consistent runtime experience across diverse computing environments. This simplifies the process of deploying applications on different systems, eliminating the need for complex installation and configuration procedures of the application. Containers have become increasingly popular in modern software development workflows as they offer fast, repeatable, and scalable deployment capabilities.

When troubleshooting containers, most of the activities are centered around checking container and application logs, resources utilization, runtime logs, and host settings. In this module, we'll cover the many ways you can get started with troubleshooting Windows containers, what tools can be used to support that process and guidance on additional tools to evaluate. First, let's take a look at how you can get it working on your environment.
