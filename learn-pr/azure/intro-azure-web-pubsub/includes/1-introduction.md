Azure Web PubSub is an excellent choice when you want to develop web applications with real-time messaging. It's a fully managed service that supports native and serverless WebSockets. You can create loosely coupled, scalable applications—including chats, live broadcasting and IoT dashboards—with the publish-subscribe messaging pattern. Using Web PubSub to manage the flow of data and content to your webpages or mobile apps, means you can focus on the functionality instead of the infrastructure.

- **High frequency data updates**: Applications like gaming, voting, polling, and auction require fast data transits, and Web PubSub can provide the necessary speed.
- **Live dashboards and monitoring**: Azure Web PubSub can be used for making company dashboard, financial market data, instant sales update, multi-player game leader board, and IoT monitoring.
- **Cross-platform live chat**: Real-time messaging is one of the signature uses of Web PubSub. It can be used for live chat room, chat bot, on-line customer support, real-time shopping assistant, messenger, in-game chat, and so on.
- **Real-time location on map**: Azure Web PubSub is widely used in logistic tracking, delivery status tracking, transportation status updates, and GPS apps.
- **Real-time targeted ads**: Azure Web PubSub can quickly assess user choices and then present personalized real-time push ads and offers.
- **Collaborative apps**: Presentation and live meeting functionality is in most of the social meeting apps, whiteboard apps, and team meeting software. Azure Web PubSub can provide a seamless experience for live collaboration.
- **Push instant notifications**: Applications like social networking, email, games, and travel apps require instant notifications to provide updates about the respective apps.
- **Real-time broadcasting**: Azure Web PubSub has a wide range of applications for live audio/video broadcasting, live captioning, translating, and events/news broadcasting.
- **IoT and connected devices**: Devices today are developed with the expectation of constant connectivity with the user. Real-time IoT metrics, remote control, real-time status, and location tracking can all be easily achieved with Azure Web PubSub.
