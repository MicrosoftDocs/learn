The goal here was to help you understand how Azure Web PubSub can help you add real-time messaging and communication functionality to your application without the need to provision and maintain WebSocket servers. We also learned that Azure Web PubSub handles hosting, scalability, load balancing, and other tasks so you're free to focus on what you do best.

Azure Web PubSub delivers real-time messages to your customers anywhere across web applications, mobile platforms, and desktop platforms with flexible SDKs.

We learned that with Azure Web PubSub, you can add sophisticated capabilities to your applications using Azure services—such as Azure Cognitive Services for speech recognition and machine learning—and help protect them with built-in Azure security.
