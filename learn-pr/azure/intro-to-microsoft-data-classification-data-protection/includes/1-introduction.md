Suppose you're the lead system engineer and server administrator at Contoso, Ltd., a medium-size electronics company based in London with a branch office in New York. Most of Contoso's compute environment runs on-premises on Windows Server, and its cloud services are under evaluation.

Contoso has an outdated operational model that uses limited automation and relies on older technology. The Contoso IT Engineering team is exploring the capabilities of Azure and the Microsoft 365 platform to help modernize its current operational model through automation and virtualization.

Contoso is also considering using Microsoft 365 productivity services instead of locally deployed services for email, intranet, and storage. You need to evaluate the data privacy, data protection, and compliance capabilities of Azure and the Microsoft 365 platform. You must decide whether these services sufficiently address Contoso's legal concerns and compliance requirements.

Microsoft data classification and information protection technologies can help you know your data, protect your data, and avoid data loss. In this module, you learn to use tools like Microsoft Purview Information Protection and Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps.
