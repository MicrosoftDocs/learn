You're ready to perform an action based on your logic app receiving a published event.

In the previous exercise, you completed the initial setup of the logic app. Now, you now need the logic app to send an email notification that contains details whenever any change occurs to any virtual machine in your resource group.

In this exercise, you'll learn how to set up a condition that enables the logic app to inspect a published event, respond with a logic app action, and send an email.

## Add a condition

First, let's create a condition that runs the logic app whenever a certain event is published.

1. In the Azure portal, the Logic app you created should be active. If not, select **Home**, and under **Recent resources**, select the Logic app you just created.

1. In the **Logic app** menu, under **Development Tools**, select **Logic app designer**. The **Logic app designer** pane for your logic app appears.

1. In the Event Grid under **When a resource event occurs**, select **New step**. The **Choose an operation** pane appears.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/5-choose-new-step-condition.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the icon for a new logic app step.":::

1. In the *Search connectors and actions* search box, enter *condition* as your filter, and the press <kbd>Enter</kbd>. From the results, select **Control**. The control workflow dialog box appears.

1. On the **Actions** tab, select **Condition** *Control*.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/5-select-condition.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the conditions for choosing an action.":::

    The Logic app designer adds an empty condition to your workflow, including action paths to follow, based on a true or false condition.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/5-empty-condition.png" alt-text="Screenshot of an empty condition.":::

1. In the **Condition** title bar, select the ellipsis icon and in the context menu, select **Rename**. Enter *If a virtual machine in your resource group has changed*.

1. In the condition work area, select **Choose a value**, then select the **Expression** tab.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/5-condition-choose-expression.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the selections for choosing an expression as a value.":::

1. In the function field, enter the value `triggerBody()?['data']['operationName']` and select **OK**.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/5-condition-add-data-operation-name.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the entered expression for a data operation.":::

1. Leave the middle box as **is equal to**, then select the remaining **Choose a value** box and enter the value `Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/write`.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/5-complete-condition.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the completed condition.":::

1. In the **Logic app designer** command bar, select **Save**.

##  email notification

Now we can add an email action based on the logic app being triggered. The following steps use Office 365 Outlook. If you don't have an Office 365 account, you can also use Outlook.com. The configuration steps for email programs may differ, so you may need to adjust accordingly.

1. In your Logic app's **Logic app designer** pane, in the *When a resource event occurs* condition's **True** box, select **Add an action**. The **Choose an operation** pane appears.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/5-condition-true-add-action.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Add an action button.":::

1. In the *Search connectors and actions* search box, enter *send an email* as your filter, then select the **Office 365 Outlook** provider.

1. From the results list, scroll down to and select **Send an email (V2)**.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/5-logic-app-send-email.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the selections for sending an email action.":::

1. If you don't already have a connection for your email provider, you might be prompted to sign in to your email account. Select **Sign in** and allow the authorization to complete.

1. On the action's title bar, select the ellipsis, select **Rename**, and rename the *Send an email (V2)* to action to *Send email when virtual machine updates*.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/5-send-email-vm-update.png" alt-text="Screenshot for sending an email when vm updates.":::

1. In the **To** field, add your own email address to test the workflow in the next section. 
1. In the **Subject** field, type **Resource updated**. You can also drag fields from the **Dynamic content** window to this field.
1. Click in the **Body** field, type **Subject:** into the **Dynamic content** window, then select **Subject** from the **Dynamic Content** pop-up window.

    If you see the following message in the **Dynamic content** window, select **See more** to see all the fields.

    `We can't find any outputs to match this input format. Select See more to see all outputs from previous actions.`

    Repeat these steps to build the **Body** field as show in the following image.

    Your email action should look similar to the following. If you selected a different email account type (Outlook.com or Gmail), your inputs might differ.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/5-logic-app-send-email-details.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Email action view.":::

1. Your finished logic app should look similar to the following screenshot.

1. In the command bar, select **Save** to save your logic app.

## Test your workflow

You've created and configured a logic app to listen for virtual machine events and send an email notification. Event details are dynamically written into the body of the email.

The final step is to test the complete workflow.

1. In the search bar at the top of the Azure portal, search for **vm1**, and select the virtual machine in the results. Your **vm1** virtual machine pane appears.

1. In the left menu pane, under **Availability + scale**, select **Size**.

1. Select a new size of **DS2_v2** from the list for the virtual machine, then select **Resize**.

1. Select **Resize** again to confirm.

1. Wait to be notified that your virtual machine has been resized, allowing time for the email to be generated and processed. After a few minutes, you should receive an email that looks similar to the following:

    ```text
    Subject: /subscriptions/0000000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000000000/resourcegroups/learn-8b04c19e-f5ab-4567-80cb-a4a1e257d6dd/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/vm1

    Event type: Microsoft.Resources.ResourceWriteSuccess
    Event ID: f917484e-eb07-428c-9a54-5c2e819a9eaf
    Time: 2021-12-10T03:59:18.7494126Z    
    ```
