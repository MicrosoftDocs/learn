In a complex cloud environment, you might need to respond to events from many different sources automatically and manually.

Suppose you work on an operations team for a large healthcare organization. You have a system with virtual machines under strict regulatory and change control. You want to be notified by email of any changes to these virtual machines' configuration in Azure. To accomplish this notification, you'll use Azure Event Grid to receive virtual-machine events and Azure Logic Apps to send emails that alert your team of any changes.

By the end of this module, you'll be able to use Event Grid to manage and route event notifications to the right destinations for your requirements.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you'll:

- Describe the capabilities and use cases for Event Grid.
- Create an application that handles events with Event Grid and Logic Apps.

## Prerequisites

- An Azure subscription
- An Office 365 or Outlook.com email account to receive notifications
