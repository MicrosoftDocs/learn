  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
    - content: "What's the persistent state of an application?"
      choices:
        - content: "It's the type of state that continues to exist even after the application has been closed."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Although state itself involves all the contents of an application stored in memory, the persistent state is the one that needs to be stored persistently across the lifecycle of the application."
        - content: "It's the state that's stored in memory or locally on the container."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "This is the ephemeral state. It's stored only in local memory or in the local container's file system and destroyed after the application or container is closed."
        - content: "It's all the disks and volumes that compose the application."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Disks and volumes make a state persistent, but they store only the state."
    - content: "How does Kubernetes handle states?"
      choices:
        - content: "It doesn't. Kubernetes doesn't have state-handling features."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Kubernetes supports state handling through a series of objects."
        - content: "It externalizes the state to another node outside the cluster."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Kubernetes doesn't have access to external nodes outside the cluster."
        - content: "It uses a set of objects called `PersistentVolumes` and `PersistentVolumeClaims`."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct. Those objects use the cluster's nodes to attach disks and give a pod their claim on that space."
    - content: "What's a best practice for handling state in Kubernetes applications?"
      choices:
        - content: "Store the state inside Kubernetes only."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Although it's possible to store state in Kubernetes, the complexity of maintaining that for a highly available and scalable application doesn't pay off."
        - content: "Remove any possible state and use only ephemeral storage."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Although this is the easiest solution, it's nearly impossible to hold a large system together without any state management."
        - content: "Delegate the state management to external specialized solutions."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "To efficiently solve all scalability and availability problems, the best option is to externalize the state to specialized applications such as Azure Cosmos DB."
