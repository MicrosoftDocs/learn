Now that our Redis cache is created in Azure, let's create an application to use it. Make sure you have your connection string information from the Azure portal.

> [!NOTE]
> The integrated Cloud Shell is available on the right. You can use that command prompt to create and run the example code we're building here, or perform these steps locally if you have a .NET Core development environment set up.

## Create a console application

We'll use a console application so we can focus on the Redis implementation.

1. In the Cloud Shell, create a new .NET Core Console Application and name it `SportsStatsTracker`.

    ```bash
    dotnet new console --name SportsStatsTracker
    ```

1. Change the current directory to the folder for the new project.

    ```bash
    cd SportsStatsTracker
    ```

## Add the connection string

Let's add the connection string we got from the Azure portal into the code. Never store credentials like this in your source code. To keep this sample simple, we're going to use a configuration file. A better approach for a server-side application in Azure would be to use Azure Key Vault with certificates.

1. Create a new **appsettings.json** file to add to the project.

    ```bash
    touch appsettings.json
    ```

1. Open the code editor by entering `code .` in the project folder. If you're working locally, we recommend using **Visual Studio Code**. The steps here will mostly align with its usage.

1. Select the **appsettings.json** file in the editor, and add the following text. Paste your connection string into the **value** of the setting.

    ```json
    {
      "CacheConnection": "[value-goes-here]"
    }
    ```

1. Save the changes.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > Whenever you paste or change code into a file in the editor, make sure to save afterwards using the **...** menu, or the accelerator key (<kbd>Ctrl+S</kbd> on Windows and Linux, <kbd>Cmd+S</kbd> on macOS).

1. Select the **SportsStatsTracker.csproj** file in the editor to open it.

1. Add the following `<ItemGroup>` configuration block into the root `<Project>` element below the `<PropertyGroup>` element. This configuration will include the new file in the project and copy it to the output folder. The instructions in this block will ensure that the app configuration file is placed in the output directory when the app is compiled/built.

   ```xml
   <Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">
       
     <PropertyGroup>
         ...
     </PropertyGroup>

     <ItemGroup>
        <None Update="appsettings.json">
          <CopyToOutputDirectory>PreserveNewest</CopyToOutputDirectory>
        </None>
     </ItemGroup>
    
   </Project>
   ```

1. Save the file.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > If you don't save the file, you'll lose the change when you add the package later.

## Add support to read a JSON configuration file

A .NET Core application requires other NuGet packages to read a JSON configuration file.

In the command prompt section of the window, add a reference to the **Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.Json** NuGet package:

```bash
dotnet add package Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.Json
```

## Add code to read the configuration file

Now that we've added the required libraries to enable reading configuration, we need to enable that functionality within our console application.

1. Select **Program.cs** in the editor. Replace the contents of the file with the following code:

   ```csharp
   using Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration;
    
   namespace SportsStatsTracker
   {
       class Program
       {
           static void Main(string[] args)
           {
               var config = new ConfigurationBuilder()
                   .SetBasePath(Directory.GetCurrentDirectory())
                   .AddJsonFile("appsettings.json")
                   .Build();
           }
       }
   }
   ```

   The `using` statement lets us access the libraries to read the configuration, and the code in the `Main` method initializes the configuration system to read from the **appsettings.json** file.

## Get the connection string from configuration

In **Program.cs**, at the end of the **Main** method, use the new **config** variable to retrieve the connection string, and store it in a new variable named **connectionString**.

The **config** variable has an indexer where you can pass in a string to retrieve from your **appSettings.json** file.

   ```csharp
   string connectionString = config["CacheConnection"];
   ```

## Add support for the Redis cache .NET client

Next, let's configure the console application to use the **StackExchange.Redis** client for .NET.

1. Add the **StackExchange.Redis** NuGet package to the project using the command prompt at the bottom of the Cloud Shell editor.

   ```bash
   dotnet add package StackExchange.Redis
   ```

1. Select **Program.cs** in the editor, and add a `using` for the namespace **StackExchange.Redis**

   ```csharp
   using StackExchange.Redis;
   ```

After the installation is completed, the Redis cache client is available to use with your project.

## Connect to the cache

Let's add the code to connect to the cache.

1. Select **Program.cs** in the editor.

1. Create a `ConnectionMultiplexer` using `ConnectionMultiplexer.Connect` by passing it your connection string. Name the returned value **cache**.

1. Because the created connection is _disposable_, wrap it in a `using` block. Your code should look something like the following.

   ```csharp
   string connectionString = config["CacheConnection"];
    
   using (var cache = ConnectionMultiplexer.Connect(connectionString))
   {
        
   }
   ```

> [!NOTE]
> The connection to Azure Cache for Redis is managed by the `ConnectionMultiplexer` class. This class should be shared and reused throughout your client application. We _don't_ want to create a new connection for each operation. Instead, we want to store it off as a field in our class and reuse it for each operation. Here, we're only going to use it in the **Main** method, but in a production application, it should be stored in a class field or a singleton.

## Add a value to the cache

Now that we have the connection, let's add a value to the cache.

1. Inside the `using` block after the connection has been created, use the `GetDatabase` method to retrieve an `IDatabase` instance:

   ```csharp
    IDatabase db = cache.GetDatabase();
   ```

1. Call `StringSet` on the `IDatabase` object to set the key "test:key" to the value "some value".

The return value from `StringSet` is a `bool` indicating whether the key was added.

1. Display the return value from `StringSet` onto the console:

   ```csharp
    bool setValue = db.StringSet("test:key", "some value");
    Console.WriteLine($"SET: {setValue}");
   ```

## Get a value from the cache

1. Next, retrieve the value using `StringGet`. This method takes the key to retrieve and returns the value.

1. Output the returned value:

   ```csharp
    string? getValue = db.StringGet("test:key");
    Console.WriteLine($"GET: {getValue}");
   ```

1. Your code should look like this:

   ```csharp
    using System;
    using Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration;
    using System.IO;
    using StackExchange.Redis;
    
    namespace SportsStatsTracker
    {
        class Program
        {
            static void Main(string[] args)
            {
                var config = new ConfigurationBuilder()
                    .SetBasePath(Directory.GetCurrentDirectory())
                    .AddJsonFile("appsettings.json")
                    .Build();
    
                string connectionString = config["CacheConnection"];
    
                using (var cache = ConnectionMultiplexer.Connect(connectionString))
                {
                    IDatabase db = cache.GetDatabase();
    
                    bool setValue = db.StringSet("test:key", "some value");
                    Console.WriteLine($"SET: {setValue}");
    
                    string? getValue = db.StringGet("test:key");
                    Console.WriteLine($"GET: {getValue}");
                }
            }
        }
    }
   ```

1. Run the application to see the result. Enter `dotnet run` in the terminal window below the editor. Make sure you're in the project folder, or it won't find your code to build and run.

   ```bash
    dotnet run
   ```

> [!TIP]
> If the program doesn't do what you expect, but compiles, it might be because you haven't saved changes in the editor. Always remember to save changes as you switch between the terminal and the editor windows.

## Use the async versions of the methods

We've been able to get and set values from the cache, but we're using the older synchronous versions of these methods. In server-side applications, these methods aren't an efficient use of our threads. Instead, we want to use the _asynchronous_ versions. You can easily spot them; they all end in **Async**.

To make these methods easy to work with, we can use the C# `async` and `await` keywords. If you're using your own .NET Core development environment instead of the integrated Cloud Shell, you must use _at least_ C# 7.1 to be able to apply these keywords to the **Main** method.

### Apply the async keyword

To apply the `async` keyword to the **Main** method. We'll have to do two things.

1. Add the `async` keyword onto the **Main** method signature.

1. Change the return type from `void` to `Task`.

   ```csharp
   using Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration;
   using StackExchange.Redis;
    
   namespace SportsStatsTracker
   {
      class Program
      {
         static async Task Main(string[] args)
         {
            ...
   ```

### Get and set values asynchronously

We can leave the synchronous methods in place. Let's add a call to the `StringSetAsync` and `StringGetAsync` methods to add another value to the cache. Set **counter** to the value **100**.  

1. Use the `StringSetAsync` and `StringGetAsync` methods to set and retrieve a key named **counter**. Set the value to **100**.

1. Apply the `await` keyword to get the results from each method.

1. Output the results to the console window, just as you did with the synchronous versions:

   ```csharp
   // Simple get and put of integral data types into the cache
   setValue = await db.StringSetAsync("counter", "100");
   Console.WriteLine($"SET: {setValue}");
    
   getValue = await db.StringGetAsync("counter");
   Console.WriteLine($"GET: {getValue}");
   ```

1. Run the application again. It should still work, and now have two values.

#### Increment the value

1. Use the `StringIncrementAsync` method to increment your **counter** value. Pass the number **50** to add to the counter:

    - Notice that the method takes the key _and_ either a `long` or `double`.

    - Depending on the parameters passed, it either returns a `long` or `double`.

1. Output the results of the method to the console.

   ```csharp
   long newValue = await db.StringIncrementAsync("counter", 50);
   Console.WriteLine($"INCR new value = {newValue}");
   ```

## Other operations

Finally, let's try executing a few more methods with the `ExecuteAsync` support.

1. Execute **PING** to test the server connection. It should respond with **PONG**.

1. Execute **FLUSHDB** to clear the database values. It should respond with **OK**:

   ```csharp
   var result = await db.ExecuteAsync("ping");
   Console.WriteLine($"PING = {result.Type} : {result}");
    
   result = await db.ExecuteAsync("flushdb");
   Console.WriteLine($"FLUSHDB = {result.Type} : {result}");
   ```

The final code should look something like the following:

   ```csharp
   using Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration;
   using StackExchange.Redis;
    
   namespace SportsStatsTracker
   {
      class Program
      {
         static async Task Main(string[] args)
         {
            var config = new ConfigurationBuilder()
               .SetBasePath(Directory.GetCurrentDirectory())
               .AddJsonFile("appsettings.json")
               .Build();
    
            string connectionString = config["CacheConnection"];
    
            using (var cache = ConnectionMultiplexer.Connect(connectionString))
            {
               IDatabase db = cache.GetDatabase();
    
               bool setValue = db.StringSet("test:key", "some value");
               Console.WriteLine($"SET: {setValue}");
    
               string getValue = db.StringGet("test:key");
               Console.WriteLine($"GET: {getValue}");
    
               setValue = await db.StringSetAsync("counter", "100");
               Console.WriteLine($"SET: {setValue}");
    
               getValue = await db.StringGetAsync("counter");
               Console.WriteLine($"GET: {getValue}");

               long newValue = await db.StringIncrementAsync("counter", 50);
               Console.WriteLine($"INCR new value = {newValue}");  
    
               var result = await db.ExecuteAsync("ping");
               Console.WriteLine($"PING = {result.Type} : {result}");
                    
               result = await db.ExecuteAsync("flushdb");
               Console.WriteLine($"FLUSHDB = {result.Type} : {result}");
            }
         }
      }
   }
   ```

When you run the application again, you should see the following output:

```output
SET: True
GET: some value
SET: True
GET: 100
INCR new value = 150
PING = SimpleString : PONG
FLUSHDB = SimpleString : OK
```

## Challenge

As a challenge, try serializing an object type to the cache. Here are the basic steps.

1. Create a new `class` with some public properties. You can invent one of your own ("Person" or "Car" are popular), or use the "GameStats" example given in the previous unit.

1. Add support for the **Newtonsoft.Json** NuGet package using `dotnet add package`.

1. Add a `using` for the `Newtonsoft.Json` namespace.

1. Create one of your objects.

1. Serialize it with `JsonConvert.SerializeObject` and use `StringSetAsync` to push it into the cache.

1. Get it back from the cache with `StringGetAsync` and then deserialize it with `JsonConvert.DeserializeObject<T>`.

Now that our Redis cache is created in Azure, let's create an application to use it. Make sure you have your connection information from the Azure portal.

> [!NOTE]
> The integrated Cloud Shell is available on the right. You can use that command prompt to create and run the example code we are building here, or perform these steps locally if you have a Node.js development environment set up.

## Create a Console Application

We'll use a console application so we can focus on the Redis implementation.

1. In the Cloud Shell, create a new directory called `redisapp`, and initialize a new Node.js app there.

   ```bash
    mkdir redisapp
    cd redisapp
    npm init -y
    touch app.js
   ```

1. Our app will use the following npm packages:

   - **redis**: The most commonly used JavaScript package for connecting to Redis.
   - **bluebird**: Used to convert the callback-style methods in the `redis` package to an awaitable Promise.
   - **dotenv**: Loads environment variables from a `.env` file, which is where we'll store our Redis connectivity information.

   Let's install them now. Run this command to add them to our app:

   ```bash
   npm install redis bluebird dotenv
   ```

## Add configuration

Let's add the connection information we got from the Azure portal into a `.env` configuration file.

1. Create a new **.env** file to the project:

   ```bash
   touch .env
   ```

1. Open the code editor by entering `code .` in the project folder. If you're working locally, we recommend using **Visual Studio Code**. The steps here will mostly align with its usage.

1. Select the **.env** file in the editor and paste in the following text:

   ```config
   REDISHOSTNAME=
   REDISKEY=
   REDISPORT=
   ```

1. Paste in the hostname, primary key, and port after the equals sign on each respective line. The complete file will look similar to the following example:

   ```config
   REDISHOSTNAME=myredishost.redis.cache.windows.net
   REDISKEY=K21mLSMN++z8d1FvIeMGy3VOAgoOmqaNYCqeE44eMDc=
   REDISPORT=6380
   ```

1. Save the file with <kbd>Ctrl+S</kbd> on Windows and Linux or <kbd>Cmd+S</kbd> on macOS.

## Set up the implementation

Now, it's time to write the code for our application.

1. Select **app.js** in the editor.

1. First, we'll add our `require` statements. Paste in the following code at the top of the file.

   ```javascript
   var Promise = require("bluebird");
   var redis = require("redis");
   ```

1. Next, we'll load our `.env` configuration, and use bluebird's `promisifyAll` function to convert the `redis` package's functions and methods to an awaitable Promise. Paste in the following code:

   ```javascript
   require("dotenv").config();
   Promise.promisifyAll(redis);
   ```

1. Now, we'll initialize a Redis client. Paste in the boilerplate code from the previous unit (using `process.env` to access our host name, port and key) to create the client:

   ```javascript
   const client = redis.createClient(
      process.env.REDISPORT,
      process.env.REDISHOSTNAME,
      {
         password: process.env.REDISKEY,
         tls: { servername: process.env.REDISHOSTNAME }
      }
   );
   ```

## Use the client to work with the cache

We're ready to write code to interact with our Redis cache.

1. First, we'll add an `async` function wrapper at the bottom of the file to contain our main code. We need this wrapper to be able to `await` the asynchronous function calls we'll be using. All of the rest of the code we'll be adding in this unit will be in this wrapper.

   ```javascript
   (async () => {

      // The rest of the code you'll paste in goes here.

   })();
   ```

1. Add a value to the cache with the `setAsync` method, and read it back with `getAsync`:

   ```javascript
   console.log("Adding value to the cache");
   await client.setAsync("myKey", "myValue");

   console.log("Reading value back:");
   console.log(await client.getAsync("myKey"));
   ```

1. Send a ping to the cache with `pingAsync`:

   ```javascript
   console.log("Pinging the cache");
   console.log(await client.pingAsync());
   ```

1. Delete all the keys in the cache with `flushdbAsync`:

   ```javascript
   await client.flushdbAsync();
   ```

1. Finally, close the connection with `quitAsync`:

   ```javascript
   await client.quitAsync();
   ```

1. Save the file. Your finished application should look like this:

   ```javascript
   var Promise = require("bluebird");
   var redis = require("redis");

   require("dotenv").config();

   Promise.promisifyAll(redis);

   const client = redis.createClient(
   process.env.REDISPORT,
   process.env.REDISHOSTNAME,
   {
      password: process.env.REDISKEY,
      tls: { servername: process.env.REDISHOSTNAME }
   }
   );

   (async () => {
     console.log("Adding value to the cache");
     await client.setAsync("myKey", "myValue");
     console.log("Reading value back:");
     console.log(await client.getAsync("myKey"));
     console.log("Pinging the cache");
     console.log(await client.pingAsync());
     await client.flushdbAsync();
     await client.quitAsync();
   })();
   ```

1. Run the application. In the Cloud Shell, execute the following command.

   ```bash
   node app.js
   ```

    You'll see the following results.

   ```output
   Adding value to the cache
   Reading value back:
   myValue
   Pinging the cache
   PONG
   ```
