  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "Suppose you're storing 400 MB of highly accessed data in a Redis cache. How should you organize it in the cache to ensure high performance?"
    choices:
    - content: "Store the data with a single key"
      explanation: "Redis works best with data that is 100 kB or less. Splitting and storing larger data with multiple keys reduces network latency and out-of-memory issues."
      isCorrect: false
    - content: "Split and store the data with multiple keys"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Redis works best with data that is 100 kB or less. Splitting and storing larger data with multiple keys reduces network latency and out-of-memory issues."
    - content: "Don't cache the data because 400 MB is too large"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Redis works best with data that is 100 kB or less. Splitting and storing larger data with multiple keys reduces network latency and out-of-memory issues."

  - content: "True or false: the length of a Redis key impacts the performance of lookup times?"
    choices:
    - content: "True"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Longer keys take up more memory and cause longer lookup times because they're compared byte-by-byte."
    - content: "False"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Longer keys take up more memory and cause longer lookup times because they're compared byte-by-byte."
      
  - content: "Which of the following storage containers isn't a valid Redis cache storage container?"
    choices:
    - content: "Nodes"
      explanation: "Data is stored in Redis by using nodes and clusters. A node is a single storage location and a cluster is a set of three or more nodes."
      isCorrect: false
    - content: "Sets"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Data is stored in Redis by using nodes and clusters. A node is a single storage location and a cluster is a set of three or more nodes."
    - content: "Clusters"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Data is stored in Redis by using nodes and clusters. A node is a single storage location and a cluster is a set of three or more nodes."
