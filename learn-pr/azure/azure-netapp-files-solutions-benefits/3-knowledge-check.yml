  questions:
  - content: Which feature of Azure NetApp Files can handle the demands of an EDA workload with performance comparable to what would be seen in on-premises deployments and reduce time to market?
    choices:
    - content: Azure NetApp Files large volumes 
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. Azure NetApp Files large volumes can handle the demands of an EDA workload with performance comparable to what would be seen in on-premises deployments.
    - content: Oracle Direct NFS (dNFS)
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. Oracle Direct NFS (dNFS) makes it possible to drive higher performance than the operating system's own NFS driver.
    - content: Automatic QoS
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. An auto QoS capacity pool allows the throughput to be assigned automatically to the volumes in the pool, proportional to the size quota assigned to the volumes. 
    - content: Cool access
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Incorrect. Cool access enables tiering of infrequently access data, which can reduce storage costs. It does not affect time-to-market. 
  - content: Which feature of Azure NetApp Files helps to protect a volume from data loss or corruption and allows administrators multiple opportunities to undo actions?
    choices: 
    - content: Azure NetApp Files data encryption
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Incorrect. Data encryption secures data at rest and also when it's in-transit between endpoints. 
    - content: Azure NetApp Files snapshots
      isCorrect: true 
      explanation: Correct. With up to 255 (rotational) snapshots in place to protect a volume from data loss or corruption, administrators have many chances to undo what has been done.
    - content: File locking
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. File locking is used to protect data against potential corruption when more than one client attempts to write to the same file at the same time, applications send lock requests to the NAS server to prevent other clients from making changes while the file is in use.
    - content: Azure NetApp Files backup 
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Incorrect. Backups provide fully managed backup solution for long-term recovery, archive, and compliance. Backups created by the service are stored in Azure storage, independent of volume snapshots that are available for near-term recovery or cloning.
