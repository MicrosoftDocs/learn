Azure Arc-enabled data services are designed to make it possible to run Azure managed data services in the infrastructure of your choice using the power of Kubernetes. Azure Arc-enabled data services include:

- **Azure Arc-enabled SQL Managed Instance**
- **Azure Arc-enabled PostgreSQL** (Public Preview)

Azure data services such as Azure SQL Managed Instance and Azure PostgreSQL are always current evergreen environments. This means they are continually updated to the latest patches and feature offerings, allowing you to quickly scale your environments while taking advantage of the unified management and compliance capabilities of Azure services.

Azure Arc-enabled data services provide a similar experience either on-premises, at the edge, or in any public cloud using Kubernetes and the infrastructure of your choice. Updates from the Microsoft Container Registry are provided to you on a deployment cadence set by you in accordance with your policies.

Utilizing Kubernetes, you can achieve cloud-like elasticity of your resources in much the same way you do in Azure, only restricted by the available capacity of your infrastructure. This allows you to meet your burst scenarios by having all your volatile resource needs located on your infrastructure.

Arc-enabled data services provide you with the unified management of all of your data services running on-premises or on any public cloud all from a single pane of glass. You can use familiar tools like the **Azure Portal**, **Azure Data Studio**, and **Azure CLI** to monitor and gain insights into all of your data services with Azure Monitor across your entire estate. 

Arc-enabled data services allow you to take advantage of Azure's industry-leading security and governance capabilities on your on-premises or public cloud-hosted infrastructure by using **Azure Security Center**, **Azure Policy**, and **Azure RBAC** to protect your data.
