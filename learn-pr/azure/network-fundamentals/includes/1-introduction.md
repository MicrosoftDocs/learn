Moving to the cloud and taking on a role as an Azure Developer, Solution Architect or Administrator requires knowing the foundations for how networking works, and how to use different devices to build networks. While networks are made up of various tangible element like network devices, switches, and routers. There are other aspects like network communication protocols, and network security which will protect your organizations assets and resources. Understanding the basic network protocols and standards, and how networks communicate is an important step in understanding Azure concepts.

In the first of three network fundamentals modules, you'll be looking at how networks communicate with each other.  You'll explore network protocols and standards, and understand the difference between a WAN and a LAN. Finally you'll get to know about TCP/IP, the Domain Name Service, and ports.

While the content of this module apply to any network, where possible you'll understand where and how this can be managed using Azure.
