  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:

  - content: "What are network standards used for?"
    choices:
    - content: "To ensure that hardware conforms to a minimum standard necessary for a good network development."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Network standards are designed to ensure that hardware and software made by different vendors work seamlessly together."
    - content: "To ensure that software is tightly constrained, and meets the needs of the organization's network."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Network standards are designed to ensure that hardware and software made by different vendors work seamlessly together."
    - content: "To ensure that hardware and software made by different vendors can work together seamlessly."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Network standards are designed to ensure that hardware and software made by different vendors work seamlessly together."

  - content: "What is the primary purpose of a hub?"
    choices:
    - content: "A hub allows one Ethernet network device to send data packets to a specific Ethernet device."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Hubs connect Ethernet network devices together, and packets are sent to all devices connected to the hub."
    - content: "A hub allows the connection of multiple Ethernet devices to make them act as a single network segment."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Hubs offer the simplest form of network. They allow multiple Ethernet-based network-enabled devices to communicate with each other."
    - content: "A hub allows multiple Ethernet network devices access to the internet."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Hubs offer the simplest form of network. They allow multiple Ethernet-based network-enabled devices to communicate with each other."

  - content: "What is the principal difference between hub routing and switch routing?"
    choices:
    - content: "Hub routing sends all packets to all connected devices. Switch routing sends packets to specific devices."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Hub routing sends all packets to all connected devices. Switch routing sends packets to specific devices."
    - content: "Hub routing sends packets to specific locations. Switch routing is only used to route traffic between switches."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Hub routing sends all packets to all connected devices. Switch routing sends packets to specific devices."
    - content: "Hub routing sends all packets to all connected devices. Switch routing is only used to route traffic between switches."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Hub routing sends all packets to all connected devices. Switch routing sends packets to specific devices."

  - content: "What does a router do?"
    choices:
    - content: "A router is a network device that works out the fastest and most efficient way to send data across a network."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "A router is designed to connect different networks together."
    - content: "A router is a network device that forwards data packets around faults in your network."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "A router is used to link different networks together. These networks can be on-premises or in the cloud via the internet."
    - content: "A router is a network device that forwards data packets between computer networks."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "A router is an essential part of your network. A router connects different networks and also connects to the internet."
