  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "What is the structure of an IPv4 address?"
    choices:
    - content: "It's made up of four groups of eight numbers, each separated by a dot."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "An IPv4 address is made up of four numbers, each separated by a dot. An example is 192.168.0.1."
    - content: "It's made up of four hexadecimal numbers (0-F), each separated by a colon."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "An IPv4 address is made up of four numbers, each separated by a dot. An example is 192.168.0.1."
    - content: "It's made up of four numbers, in the range 0-255, each separated by a dot."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "An IPv4 address is made up of four numbers, each separated by a dot. An example is 192.168.0.1."
  - content: "What is TCP/IP?"
    choices:
    - content: "It's a protocol that improves network device security on the internet."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "TCP/IP is a suite of communication protocols that allow different networked devices to communicate with each other."
    - content: "It's a protocol used to secure connections on the internet."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "TCP/IP is a suite of communication protocols that allow different networked devices to communicate with each other."
    - content: "It's a protocol used to interconnect network devices on the internet."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "TCP/IP is a suite of communication protocols that allow different networked devices to communicate with each other."
  - content: "What is a subnet?"
    choices:
    - content: "It's the natural subdivision of an IP address into host and network."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Subnets allow your network to be divided into multiple subnetworks."
    - content: "It's a control mechanism to limit access to an IP-based network."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Subnets allow your network to be divided into multiple subnetworks."
    - content: "It's the logical subdivision of an IP-based network."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Subnets allow your network to be divided into multiple subnetworks."
  - content: "How would you access a private network from the internet?"
    choices:
    - content: "By connecting directly to the IP address of the private network."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "It's not possible to access a private network from the internet. A private network can access another private network by using network address translation."
    - content: "The private network needs special access via a gateway."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "It's not possible to access a private network from the internet. A private network can access another private network by using network address translation."
    - content: "It's possible to access a private network from the internet. A private network can't access another private network by using network address translation."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "It's not possible to access a private network from the internet. A private network can access another private network by using network address translation."
  - content: "What is the DNS?"
    choices:
    - content: "The DNS helps resolve IP addresses to domain names."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The DNS is a hierarchical and decentralized naming system for computers, services, or other resources connected to the internet or a private network."
    - content: "The DNS helps resolve MAC addresses to IP addresses."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The DNS is a hierarchical and decentralized naming system for computers, services, or other resources connected to the internet or a private network."
    - content: "The DNS helps resolve domain names to IP addresses."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "It's a hierarchical and decentralized naming system for computers, services, or other resources connected to the internet or a private network."
