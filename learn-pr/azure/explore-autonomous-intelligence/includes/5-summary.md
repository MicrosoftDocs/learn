In this module you’ve learned about Autonomous Intelligence technologies that include machine learning, deep learning and deep reinforcement learning. These technologies are potential components of an Autonomous AI brain design implemented using the new AI paradigm of Machine Teaching.

You’ve also learned strengths and when to best use these technologies and their limitations and when Autonomous Intelligence methods can support them.

> [!NOTE]
> To learn about Machine Teaching that is new AI paradigm, review Module 2 – Introduction to Machine Teaching.
