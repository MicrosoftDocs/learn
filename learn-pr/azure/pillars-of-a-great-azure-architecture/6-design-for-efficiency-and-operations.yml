quiz:
  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:

  - content: "Suppose you have recently moved your application to the cloud and your monthly bill seems higher than expected. The utilization level of your VM is high enough that you are hesitant to downsize. What might be a reasonable next step you could take to help you find inefficiencies?"
    choices:
    - content: "Wait a month and recheck your bill"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This will tell you where you are spending money but will not help you determine the efficiency level of the components of your system."
    - content: "Increase the amount of application testing you do before each release"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This can improve the quality of your application, but generally would not help you identify infrastructure inefficiencies."
    - content: "Add monitoring and instrumentation"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Continuous monitoring will give you the data you need to find cost savings. For example, you might find that demand is extremely variable and multiple small VMs with autoscale could cost less than the single large VM you currently use."

  - content: "Which of the following is an example of improving operational efficiency?"
    choices:
    - content: "Automating the deployment of infrastructure"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Automating the deployment of infrastructure is a great example of improving your operational efficiency."
    - content: "Moving services from PaaS to IaaS"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Moving services from PaaS to IaaS is a step backwards in operational efficiency, as PaaS services typically come with reduced operational costs."
    - content: "Documenting manual steps for the deployment of infrastructure"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Documentation is important with any architecture, but operational improvement comes with automating the manual activities as opposed to simply documenting them."
    - content: "Maintaining multiple logging systems"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Maintaining multiple logging systems comes with increased operational overhead and a reduced ability to correlate events and metrics across the logging systems. Centralizing on a single login system can improve operational efficiency."
