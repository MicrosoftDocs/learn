    - content: "Short Messaging Service (SMS)"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "New customers are unlikely to be willing to provide their mobile phone number, so Short Messaging Service (SMS) messages couldn't be sent to them. Chat is a better option for prospective customers because it doesn't require an existing relationship with a customer."
    - content: "Chat"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Engaging with a new customer with a live chat interface is a great way to answer any immediate questions they have. This can also be done in a way that doesn't require a customer commitment."
    - content: "Voice and video calling"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "New customers are usually unwilling to be forced into a call with a live agent. Chat is a better option for prospective customers because it can be more passive and doesn't require a customer commitment."
