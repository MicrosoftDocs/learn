  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "You have a web application built with the Ruby on Rails framework. You want to show Azure Storage metrics stored in Azure Monitor in that application. Which API should you use?"
    choices:
    - content: "The Azure Monitor REST API"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Azure Storage accounts place metrics in Azure Monitor and you can access them with the Azure Monitor APIs. You can use the REST API in your application because Ruby on Rails can submit REST requests and process the results."
    - content: "The Azure Monitor .NET API"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Although you must use an Azure Monitor API to access the metrics, you can't use the .NET API in a Ruby on Rails application. Instead, use the Azure Monitor REST API."
    - content: "The Azure Storage REST API"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Because the metrics are stored in Azure Monitor, you can't use the Azure Storage REST API to access them. Instead, use the Azure Monitor REST API."
  - content: "You have an existing mobile app written in C# that displays metrics that it retrieves from the $Metric tables in a Storage Account. You want to ensure the app continues to function for the foreseeable future with as little replacement code as possible. What should you do?"
    choices:
    - content: "Update the mobile app so that it uses the Azure Storage REST API to access metrics."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "You must use an Azure Monitor API to access the most up-to-date metrics, which are stored in Azure Monitor. Classic metrics can be accessed with an Azure Storage API, but those APIs are deprecated and likely to be removed in the future."
    - content: "Update the mobile app so that it uses an Azure Storage .NET API to access metrics."
      isCorrect: false
