  questions:
  - content: "What is an example of reinforcement learning?"
    choices:
    - content: "Rewarding the user for selecting the proper item."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Reinforcement learning isn't intended to offer rewards for choices made."
    - content: "The act of retraining the model by adding new inputs."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. You might want to retrain the model with new inputs if it's not performing as expected, but that's not a definition of reinforcement learning."
    - content: "Actions influence later inputs."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Applied to artificial intelligence, reinforcement learning is considered a *closed-loop* model. The term refers to a model where the actions influence later inputs. The model learns behaviors to use based on feedback collected from its use."
  - content: "What is Apprentice mode?"
    choices:
    - content: "A learning behavior that helps warm-start a Personalizer model to train without impacting the application's outcomes and actions."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Apprentice mode helps to mitigate the cold-start problem with a new untrained model. It allows you to validate the action and context features that are sent to Personalizer."
    - content: "Setting up a staging environment to help train the model before pushing to release."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Apprentice mode isn't concerned with staging environments for model training."
    - content: "The default learning behavior for Personalizer, where your learning loop uses machine learning to build the model that predicts the top action for your content."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The default learning behavior is called Online mode."
  - content: "Why is it important to ensure you have clearly defined business goals for your Personalizer scenario?"
    choices:
    - content: "To satisfy business acceptance testing (BAT) needs."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While BAT may be necessary to validate the outcome of the using Personalizer, it's not a reason to have clear business goals."
    - content: "Clearly defined business goals are critical to ensuring Personalizer is a valid choice for the intended purpose."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Personalizer isn't the right choice for all scenarios. Without clearly defined business goals, the application of Personalizer may not achieve the desired outcomes."
    - content: "Personalizer can be used in any scenario so business goals are irrelevant."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Just like careful planning for the service or application is critical to its success, business goals are a critical component of a Personalizer evaluation and implementation scenario."
