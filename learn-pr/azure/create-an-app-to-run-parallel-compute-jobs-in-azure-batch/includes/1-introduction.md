You're a software developer for a company that manages a network of pet shelters across the country/region. Finding new homes for these animals is difficult. You decide to revamp the website to include a daily social feed of each animal. Every day, pet shelter staff record a short video of each pet and post them to a central storage location. To make the cute videos easier to download and share virally, you want to convert these videos each day into animated GIF files. 

Converting a video to an animated GIF is compute-intensive, and you only need bursts of compute resources each day to get the task done. You decide to invest in an Azure Batch workload running ffmpeg to get the job done. You can convert the videos to animated GIFs efficiently by taking advantage of Azure Batch parallelism, just in time for the daily update of cuteness on your website!
