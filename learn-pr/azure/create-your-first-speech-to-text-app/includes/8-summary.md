In this module, you learned how Microsoft's Azure AI services provide developers with APIs to create applications that take advantage of Azure AI speech to text features.

You created an Azure AI services account, which you used to create two speech to text applications:

- A command-line application that used single-shot recognition to convert simple speech to text.

- A command-line application that used continuous recognition to convert extended speech to text.

You also learned how you can improve your recognition results by providing a list of phrases that might be unfamiliar to the speech recognition engine.
