In this module, you viewed Azure Blob Storage metric information in the Azure portal. You then created custom dashboards in the Azure portal, and retrieved resource logs.

## More information

Transaction metrics are sent to Azure Monitor every minute, and are available both for the account and the service. For more information, see [Monitoring Azure Blob Storage](/azure/storage/common/storage-metrics-in-azure-monitor).

You can also specify custom metrics. For more information, see [Custom metrics in Azure Monitor](/azure/azure-monitor/platform/metrics-custom-overview).

Shared dashboards are an Azure resource, which means you can share them by using role-based access control (RBAC). RBAC enables you to apply roles to Azure user accounts or groups, which can then access a resource or resource group. You can apply different roles to different users or groups, so that some users can only view a resource but other users can manage a resource. For more information, see the following articles:
