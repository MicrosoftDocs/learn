  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
    - content: "In an Azure Functions application, how would you change the route endpoint for a function in a folder named _getVacations_ to `vacations`?"
      choices:
        - content: "Use the `route` property in the route definition object for that function."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct. The `route` is way to set the function's route."
        - content: "Change the `methods` property in the route definition object for that function."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. The `methods` property defines which HTTP methods are directed to the route."
        - content: "Change the `authLevel` property in the route definition object for that function."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. The `authLevel` property defines the authorization level required to access the function."
        - content: "Add the `redirect` property in the route definition object for that function."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. There isn't a `redirect` parameter in the object."
    - content: "In a Functions application, where do you find the code that runs when an HTTP request is made?"
      choices:
        - content: "In the _servers_ folder, in the Functions application root."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. The function app doesn't create a _servers_ folder."
        - content: "In the _functions_ folder."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct. Each function is in the functions folder. The organization of those files is flexible to your needs."
        - content: "In the _models_ folder, in the Functions application root."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. The function app doesn't create a _models_ folder."
        - content: "In the _routes.ts_ file."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. A Functions application doesn't have a _routes.ts_ file by default."
    - content: "How do you access the request and response objects of HTTP calls in a Functions application?"
      choices:
        - content: "Use the `request` and `context` parameters passed to each function."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct.  Each function is passed these parameters."
        - content: "Use the `HttpRequest` parameter passed to each function."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. The `HttpRequest` parameter represents the HTTP request, but it doesn't offer access to the context."
        - content: "Use the `Request` and `Response` parameters passed to each function."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. The `Response` isn't directly passed to the function."
        - content: "Use the `async`/`await` syntax to access the request and response."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. The `async`/`await` syntax helps execute asynchronous code, not the request and response."
