  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
    - content: "In an Azure Functions application, how would you change the route endpoint for a function in a folder named _vacations-get_ to `vacations`?"
      choices:
        - content: "Add the `route` property to the `bindings` array for the `req` object in the _function.json_ file."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct. By convention, the `req` object defaults the route to the same name as the folder that contains the function. To override the name of the route, you add the `route` property."
        - content: "Change the `methods` property in the `bindings` array for the `req` object in the _function.json_ file."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. The `methods` property defines which HTTP methods are directed to the route."
        - content: "Change the `authLevel` property in the `bindings` array for the `req` object in the _function.json_ file."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. The `authLevel` property defines the authorization level required to access the function."
        - content: "Add the `redirect` property to the `bindings` array for the `req` object in the _function.json_ file."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. There isn't a `redirect` parameter for HTTP bindings."
    - content: "In a Functions application, where do you find the code that runs when an HTTP request is made?"
      choices:
        - content: "In the _function.json_ file, in the function's folder."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. The _function.json_ file contains the function's configuration."
        - content: "In the _index.ts_ file, in the function's folder."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct. Each function is in a folder that contains an _index.ts_ file, which fires for its matching route."
        - content: "In the _host.json_ file, in the Functions application root."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. The _host.json_ file contains configuration for the overall application."
        - content: "In the _routes.ts_ file."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. A Functions application doesn't have a _routes.ts_ file by default."
    - content: "How do you access the request and response objects of HTTP calls in a Functions application?"
      choices:
        - content: "Use the `Context` parameter that passes to each function."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct.  Each function is passed a `Context` object that contains `req` and `res` properties. `Context.req` and `Context.res` are the request and response of the HTTP call."
        - content: "Use the `HttpRequest` parameter that passes to each function."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. The `HttpRequest` parameter represents the HTTP request, but it doesn't offer access to the response."
        - content: "Use the `Request` and `Response` parameters that pass to each function."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. The `Request` and `Response` parameters don't directly pass to the function."
        - content: "Use the `async`/`await` syntax to access the request and response."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. The `async`/`await` syntax helps execute asynchronous code, not the request and response."
