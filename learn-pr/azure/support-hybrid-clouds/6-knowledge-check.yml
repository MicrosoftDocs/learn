  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "What allows the storage and processing of the highest classification data but also enables customers to upload resulting information or models directly to Azure?"
    choices:
    - content: "Azure Stack Hub."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Azure Stack Hub enables customers to run workloads using the same architecture and APIs as in Azure while having a physically isolated network for their highest classification data."
    - content: "Azure Stack Edge."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Azure Stack Edge allows the storage and processing of the highest classification data but also enables customers to upload resulting information or models directly to Azure.  This approach creates a path for information sharing between domains that makes it easier and more secure."
    - content: "Tactical Azure Stack Hub."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Tactical Azure Stack Hub is also available to address tactical edge deployments for limited or no connectivity, fully mobile requirements, harsh conditions requiring military specification solutions, and so on."
    - content: "Hardware security module."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Hardware security modules (HSMs) allow customers to store their encryption keys and other secrets in HSMs controlled solely by customers."
  - content: "Which service provides physical servers that are used for only one Azure subscription?"
    choices:
    - content: "Azure Dedicated Host."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Azure Dedicated Host provides physical servers that can host one or more Azure VMs and are dedicated to one Azure subscription."
    - content: "Confidential computing."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Confidential computing offers encryption of data while it's in use, ensuring that data is always under customer control."
    - content: "Azure Stack Edge."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Azure Stack Edge is an AI-enabled edge computing device with network data transfer capabilities."
    - content: "Customer Lockbox."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Customer Lockbox allows customers to approve and deny elevated access requests for customer data in support scenarios."
  - content: "Which of the following is a use case for Azure Stack Edge?"
    choices:
    - content: "Lock down inbound traffic to Azure VMs by creating network security group (NSG) rules."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Just-in-time (JIT) virtual machine (VM) access can be used to lock down inbound traffic to Azure VMs by creating network security group (NSG) rules."
    - content: "Run initial Machine Learning algorithms and act of them before sending data to the cloud to improve the model."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. With Azure Stack Edge, customers can run machine learning models to get results quickly and act on them before the data is sent to the cloud."
    - content: "Store encryption keys and other secrets in HSMs deployed on-premises and controlled solely by customers."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. User-provided hardware security modules (HSMs) allow customers to store their encryption keys and other secrets in HSMs deployed on-premises and controlled solely by customers."
    - content: "Run workloads using the same architecture and APIs as in Azure while having a physically isolated network for the highest classification data."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Azure Stack Hub enables customers to run workloads using the same architecture and APIs as in Azure while having a physically isolated network for their highest classification data."
