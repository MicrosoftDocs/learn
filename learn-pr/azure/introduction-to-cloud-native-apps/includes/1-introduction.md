Cloud-native apps represent a modern approach to app development, where software systems are designed with cloud technologies in mind. Unlike apps that were originally designed to run on premises, cloud-native apps can take full advantage of the many services Azure has to offer.

Many cloud architects opt for Open-Source Software (OSS) like Kubernetes and Docker when designing cloud-native apps, but turn to proprietary offerings like Cosmos DB when the benefit is overwhelming. Because of this, cloud-native apps make the end-to-end process of building an application easier, with a focus on **architectural modularity**, rather than monolithic, all-in-one applications. You can utilize the technologies that suit your skill set and situation, without being locked into technology choices.

## Scenario: Smart refrigerators, smarter service, at scale

Suppose you work for Adatum Corporation, a manufacturer of home appliances. You lead a small development team and you're tasked with building an app for smart refrigerators.

We could, for example, start with creating a small inventory management app for the refrigerators, so businesses can know what needs to be restocked, or potentially, have items reordered automatically. It's the nature of cloud-native apps to contain loosely coupled functionality, so we can be more agile in our design and avoid having to predict future requirements. Rather, we can extend the app if it becomes necessary. Later, we can add functionality to the app, such as connecting to refrigerator telemetry and onboard sensors.
