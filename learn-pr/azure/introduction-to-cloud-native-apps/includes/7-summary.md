In this module, you learned about cloud-native apps. You also learned about services, containers, and other cloud services and concepts.

Cloud-native apps present a new, modern approach for building systems. If you want to learn more about containers, you can see [Introduction to Docker containers](/learn/modules/intro-to-docker-containers/). If you want to learn more about how to orchestrate containers, you can see [Introduction to Kubernetes](/learn/modules/intro-to-kubernetes/) and [Introduction to Azure Kuberenetes Service](/learn/modules/intro-to-azure-kubernetes-service/).

Now that you have reviewed this module, you should be able to:

* Describe the fundamental structure of a Cloud Native App
* Identify situations where you should build a Cloud Native App
