  questions:
  - content: 'A cloud-native architecture has a focus on:'
    choices:
    - content: "A single codebase where all the different functionalities reside."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A single codebase would indicate a monolithic approach. A cloud-native approach separates different functionality."
    - content: "Architectural modularity, using pre-built cloud services and container technologies where they're best suited."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. A cloud-native architecture focuses on having individual, separated components that form different services. CNAs are built to use cloud-based services to handle aspects like security where appropriate."
    - content: "A hybrid-cloud approach."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While a hybrid-cloud approach may be part of some cloud-native architectures, not all cloud-native architectures use a hybrid cloud approach."
    - content: "Smart fridges."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Smart fridges are our scenario, not all cloud-native apps focus on smart fridges."
  - content: 'How do containers provide a reliable environment that works the same on different machines?'
    choices:
    - content: "Containers contain an image of a virtual machine OS - once loaded, the virtual machine always runs the same."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Containers don't contain a virtual machine OS - they're lightweight and encapsulate dependencies, but not an operating system."
    - content: "Container orchestrators manage containers that replace hardware as needed."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While container orchestrators do manage containers, they don't replace hardware as needed."
    - content: "Containers use a hybrid-development approach where you set new parameters every time you deploy."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Containers use the exact same container image when deployed. You don't have to set new parameters every time you deploy."
    - content: "Containers are self-contained and encapsulate their own code, configuration, and dependencies, including references to the OS they run on."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Containers are self-contained and have the exact same container image when deployed. They reliably function the same on different machines."
  - content: 'How can cloud-native apps help to create business value?'
    choices:
    - content: "A cloud-native approach allows rapid incorporation of user feedback."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While a cloud-native approach can provide rapid incorporation of user feedback, there are other ways cloud-native apps help to create business value."
    - content: "Cloud services have built in tools and integrations for automation, such as continuous integration (CI) and continuous deployment (CD) pipelines. Therefore, cloud-native apps are more likely to have robust DevOps procedures, which can decrease costs and increase reliability."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While automation is a benefit of cloud native processes, there are other ways cloud-native apps help to create business value"
    - content: "A Cloud Native architecture allows individual services to be updated and deployed without downtime for other services."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While there's significant business value from being able to update a service with no downtime for other services, there are other ways cloud-native apps help to create business value"
    - content: "All of the above."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Rapid incorporation of user feedback increases business agility for constant improvement, automation can decrease costs and increase reliability, and individual services being able to update a service with no downtime for other services all provide real business value."
