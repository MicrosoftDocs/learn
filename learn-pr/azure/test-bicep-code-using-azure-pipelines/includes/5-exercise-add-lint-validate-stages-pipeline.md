You've spoken to your team and have decided to further automate your deployments by using a pipeline. You want to build more confidence in what you deploy.

In this exercise, you'll add validation stages to your pipeline. You'll then run the linter and preflight validation before each deployment.

During the process, you'll:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Update your existing pipeline to add two new stages to lint and validate your Bicep code.
> * Run your pipeline.
> * Fix any issues that your pipeline detects.

## Update your pipeline to prepare for stages

First, you need to update your pipeline file to define a stage. Azure Pipelines automatically creates a single stage for you, but because you'll add more stages soon, you need to update your pipeline to explicitly define stages.

1. In Visual Studio Code, open the _azure-pipelines.yml_ file in the _deploy_ folder.

1. Remove everything in the file from line 14 to the bottom of the file. Be sure to also remove the `jobs:` line.

1. At the bottom of the file, add the following code:

   :::code language="yaml" source="code/5-pipeline.yml" range="14-15, 43-57" :::

   > [!TIP]
   > YAML files are sensitive to indentation. Whether you type or paste this code, make sure your indentation is correct. Later in this exercise, you'll see the complete YAML pipeline definition so that you can verify that your file matches.

## Add lint and validation stages to your pipeline

1. Below the `stages:` line, add a lint stage:

   :::code language="yaml" source="code/5-pipeline.yml" range="16-24" :::

   This stage defines a single step that runs the `az bicep build` command to lint the Bicep file.

1. Below the lines that you just added, add a validation stage:

   :::code language="yaml" source="code/5-pipeline.yml" range="26-41" :::

   This stage defines a single step that runs the preflight validation. Notice that this step includes a reference to your service connection. That reference is needed because the preflight validation process requires communication with Azure.

   Your pipeline definition now has three stages. The first runs the linter on your Bicep file, the second performs a preflight validation, and the third performs the deployment to Azure.

1. Save the file.

## Configure the linter

By default, the Bicep linter provides a warning when it detects a problem in a file. Azure Pipelines doesn't treat linter warnings as problems that should stop your pipeline. To customize this behavior, create a _bicepconfig.json_ file that reconfigures the linter.

1. Add a new file in the _deploy_ folder and name it _bicepconfig.json_.

   :::image type="content" source="../media/5-visual-studio-code-bicep-config-file.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Visual Studio Code Explorer. The new file is shown in the deploy folder.":::

1. Copy the following code into the file:

   :::code language="json" source="code/5-bicepconfig.json" :::

1. Save the file.

## Verify and commit your pipeline definition

1. Verify that your _azure-pipelines.yml_ file looks like the following file:

   :::code language="yaml" source="code/5-pipeline.yml" :::

   If it doesn't look the same, update it to match this example, and then save it.

1. Commit and push your changes to your Git repository by running the following commands in the Visual Studio Code terminal:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add lint and validation stages"
   git push
   ```

   Immediately after you push, Azure Pipelines starts a new pipeline run.

## View the pipeline run

1. In your browser, go to **Pipelines**.

1. Select the most recent run of your pipeline.

   :::image type="content" source="../media/5-pipeline-last-run.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Azure DevOps. The link to the latest pipeline run is highlighted.":::

   If the pipeline is still running, wait until it's finished. Although Azure Pipelines automatically updates the page with the latest status, it's a good idea to refresh your page occasionally.

1. Notice that the pipeline run now shows the three stages that you defined in the YAML file. Also notice that the **Lint** stage failed.

   :::image type="content" source="../media/5-pipeline-run-stages-lint.png" alt-text="Screenshot of a pipeline run in Azure DevOps. The Lint stage is reporting a failure." lightbox="../media/5-pipeline-run-stages-lint.png":::

1. Select the **Lint** stage to see more details.

   :::image type="content" source="../media/5-pipeline-run-lint-stage-select.png" alt-text="Screenshot of a pipeline run in Azure DevOps. The name of the Lint stage is highlighted.":::

1. Select the **Run Bicep linter** step to view the pipeline log.

   :::image type="content" source="../media/5-pipeline-run-lint-stage-step.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the pipeline log for the Lint stage. The step for running a Bicep linter is highlighted.":::

   Notice that the error displayed is similar to this one:

   > Error no-unused-params: Parameter "storageAccountNameParam" is declared but never used.

   This error indicates that the linter found a rule violation in your Bicep file.

## Fix the linter error

Now that you've identified the problem, you can fix it in your Bicep file.

1. In Visual Studio Code, open the _main.bicep_ file in the _deploy_ folder.

1. Notice that the Bicep linter has also detected that the `storageAccountNameParam` parameter isn't used. Visual Studio Code indicates the unused parameter with a wavy line. Normally, the line would be yellow to indicate a warning. But because you customized the _bicepconfig.json_ file, the linter treats the code as an error and displays the line in red. Here's the line:

   :::code language="bicep" source="code/5-template-1.bicep" range="15" :::

1. Delete the `storageAccountNameParam` parameter.

1. Save the file.

1. Commit and push your changes to your Git repository by running the following commands in the Visual Studio Code terminal:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Remove unused parameter"
   git push
   ```

   Once again, Azure Pipelines automatically triggers a new run of your pipeline.

## View the pipeline run again

1. In your browser, go to your pipeline.

1. Select the most recent run.

   Wait until the pipeline run completes. Although Azure Pipelines automatically updates the page with the latest status, it's a good idea to refresh the page occasionally.

1. Notice that the **Lint** stage finished successfully, but now the **Validate** stage has failed.

   :::image type="content" source="../media/5-pipeline-run-stages-validate.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the pipeline run. The Lint stage reports success and the Validate stage reports failure.":::

1. Select the **Validate** stage to see more details.

1. Select the **Run preflight validation** step to view the pipeline log.

   :::image type="content" source="../media/5-pipeline-run-validate-stage-step.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the pipeline log for the Validate stage. The step for running preflight validation is highlighted." lightbox="../media/5-pipeline-run-validate-stage-step.png":::

   Notice that the error displayed in the log includes the following message:

   > mystorageresourceNameSuffix is not a valid storage account name. Storage account name must be between 3 and 24 characters in length and use numbers and lower-case letters only.

   This error indicates that the storage account name isn't valid.

## Fix the validation error

You found another problem in the Bicep file. Here, you'll fix the problem.

1. In Visual Studio Code, open the _main.bicep_ file in the _deploy_ folder.

1. Look at the definition of the `storageAccountName` variable:

   :::code language="bicep" source="code/5-template-2.bicep" range="16-20" highlight="5" :::

   The string interpolation hasn't been configured correctly.

1. Update the `storageAccountName` variable to correctly use string interpolation:

   :::code language="bicep" source="code/5-template-3.bicep" range="20" :::

1. Save the file.

1. Commit and push the changes to your Git repository by running the following commands in the Visual Studio Code terminal:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix string interpolation"
   git push
   ```

## View the successful pipeline run

1. In your browser, go to your pipeline.

1. Select the most recent run.

   Wait until the pipeline run completes. Although Azure Pipelines automatically updates the page with the latest status, it's a good idea to refresh the page occasionally.

1. Notice that all three stages of the pipeline have finished successfully:

   :::image type="content" source="../media/5-pipeline-run-stages-success.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the pipeline run in Azure DevOps, with all three stages reporting success.":::

You now have a pipeline that successfully detects errors in your Bicep code early in your deployment process and then deploys to Azure if there are no errors.
