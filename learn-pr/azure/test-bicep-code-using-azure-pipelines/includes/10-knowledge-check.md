You create a deployment pipeline. When you run the pipeline, it fails when it reaches the **Deploy** stage.

You get the following error in the pipeline log:

> The provided location is not available for this resource type.

You fix the problem in your Bicep file by changing the `location` property of the resource, and then you rerun the pipeline successfully.
