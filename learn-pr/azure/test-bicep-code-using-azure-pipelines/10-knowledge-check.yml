      What can you do to minimize the chance of this error happening again?
    choices:
    - content: Add an approval check to the pipeline.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. An approval check enables you to manually verify the status of your environment or pipeline. It doesn't reduce the chance of an invalid template being submitted to Azure.
    - content: Run preflight validation within your pipeline.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. The preflight validation process performs validation of your template. It reports errors that prevent the template deployment from being submitted to Azure.
    - content: Add a rollback stage to your pipeline.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. You can add a rollback stage to reverse the effects of a stage that's failed, but it doesn't validate the Bicep file that you submit.
  - content: Which of these scenarios is an example of negative testing?
    choices:
    - content: Manually approving a pipeline run.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. However, you might choose to manually run tests and then approve the pipeline run.
    - content: Rolling back your deployment if something fails.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. However, you might choose to roll back a deployment if your negative tests fail.
    - content: Verifying that a website is accessible only through HTTPS and not through HTTP.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. Negative tests verify that your resource doesn't exhibit unwanted behavior, like responding on nonsecure protocols.
  - content: Which of these statements is true?
    choices:
    - content: The Bicep linter needs to be installed separately from Bicep.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. The Bicep linter is part of the Bicep tooling. It runs automatically when you build or deploy a Bicep file.
    - content: A template with no linting warnings or errors is guaranteed to deploy successfully.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. The linter runs some basic checks on code style. Your template might successfully pass the linter's checks, but not deploy.
    - content: Linting ensures that your Bicep file meets a minimum quality level for code style.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. The linter doesn't verify that your file will deploy successfully, but it checks that your Bicep file follows some basic rules for code style.
