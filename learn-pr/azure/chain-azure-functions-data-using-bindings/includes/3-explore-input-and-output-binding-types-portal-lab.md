In this exercise, we create a function that runs when it receives an HTTP request, and responds to each request by returning a message. 

See the following high-level illustration of what we're going to build.

## Create a function

::: zone pivot="javascript"

Now that we have a function app, it's time to create a function. Each function has a trigger that activates it. In this module, we define an HTTP trigger by using a predefined template.

1. Select the **Create function** button under **Create in Azure portal** in the **Functions** tab on the **Overview** page.

1. The **Create function** pane appears.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/3-add-function-small.png" alt-text="Screenshot for the Create Function pane." lightbox="../media/3-add-function.png":::

1. In the **Select a template** section, select the **HTTP trigger** template, and then select **Next**.

1. In the **Template details** section, confirm the following settings.

    - In the **Function name** text box, use the default name *HttpTrigger1*. Azure automatically creates unique names for the functions you create. You can choose a different name, but remember to use meaningful names.

    - In the **Authorization level** text box, use the default value *Function*. Authorization level determines what keys need to be present on the request in order for it to run. *Function* authorization level requires a function-specific key, which we can find after the function is created.

1. Select **Create**. When the trigger function is propagated to your function app, the **Functions** pane for your *Function App* appears, listing *HttpTrigger1*.

1. In the command bar, select **Get Function Url**. The **Get Function Url** dialog box appears.

1. In the dropdown list, select **default (function key)**, select the *Copy to clipboard* icon at the end of the URL, and then select **OK** to close the dialog.

1. In the address bar of a new browser tab, paste the function URL you copied. Press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to run the request in your browser. The response might take a couple of minutes as the function app initializes. If you receive a timeout error, refresh to resend the request.

   When the function responds, you should see output similar to the following example displayed in your browser.

    ```output
    This HTTP triggered function executed successfully. Pass a name in the query string or in the request body for a personalized response.
    ```

1. Add the following query string `&name=Joe` to the end of the URL. Your resulting URL should resemble the following example:

    `https://example.azurewebsites.net/api/HttpTrigger1?code=AbCdEfGhIjKlMnOpQrStUvWxYz==&name=Joe`  

1. Press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to run the request in your browser. When the function responds, you should see output similar to the following example displayed in your browser.

    ```output
    Hello, Joe. This HTTP triggered function executed successfully.
    ```

    As you can see from this exercise so far, you must define a trigger when you create a function. Each function has a single trigger. In this example, we're using an HTTP trigger, which means our function starts when it receives an HTTP request. The default implementation from the template, shown in JavaScript in the following screenshot, returns the value of the parameter *name* that was in the query string or body of the request. If no query string was provided, the function responds with a message that asks whomever is calling to supply a name value.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/3-default-http-trigger-implementation-javascript-small.png" alt-text="Illustration of default HTTP trigger, showing HTTP request and response binding parameters." lightbox="../media/3-default-http-trigger-implementation-javascript.png":::

1. In the Azure portal, in the **Function** menu, select **Code + Test**.

    The **Code + Test** pane for your function appears, and displays the contents of your **index.js** file. The default JavaScript code for your function should resemble the following example.

    ```javascript
    module.exports = async function (context, req) {
        context.log('JavaScript HTTP trigger function processed a request.');
   
        const name = (req.query.name || (req.body && req.body.name));
        const responseMessage = name
            ? "Hello, " + name + ". This HTTP triggered function executed successfully."
            : "This HTTP triggered function executed successfully. Pass a name in the query string or in the request body for a personalized response.";

        context.res = {
            // status: 200, /* Defaults to 200 */
            body: responseMessage
        };
    }
    ```

1. Let's look briefly at the function's other file, the **function.json** config file. Access this file by selecting **function.json** from the dropdown list in the filepath above the code block. The configuration data is shown in the following JSON listing.

    ```json
    {
        "bindings": [
        {
            "authLevel": "function",
            "type": "httpTrigger",
            "direction": "in",
            "name": "req",
            "methods": [
            "get",
            "post"
            ]
        },
        {
            "type": "http",
            "direction": "out",
            "name": "res"
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

    This function has a *trigger binding* named **req** of type `httpTrigger`, and an output binding named **res** of type `http`.
  
In the preceding code for our function, we saw that we accessed the payload of the incoming HTTP request through the **req** parameter. Similarly, we sent an HTTP response by setting our **res** parameter. Bindings really do take care of some of the burdensome work for us!

::: zone pivot="powershell"

Now that we have a function app, let's create a function. Each function has a trigger that activates it. In this module, we create an HTTP trigger by using a template.

1. Select the **Create function** button under **Create in Azure portal** in the **Functions** tab on the **Overview** page.

1. The **Create function** pane appears.

1. In the **Select a template** section, select the **HTTP trigger** template, then select **Next**.

1. In the **Template details** section, confirm the following settings.

    - In the **Function name** text box, use the default name *HttpTrigger1*. Azure automatically provides a unique name when you create a function. You can choose a different name, but remember to use meaningful names.

    - In the **Authorization level** text box, accept  the default value *Function*. Authorization level determines what keys need to be present on the request in order for it to run. *Function* requires a function-specific key.

        :::image type="content" source="../media/3-add-function-small.png" alt-text="Screenshot for the Add Function pane." lightbox="../media/3-add-function.png#lightbox":::

1. Select **Create**. The **HttpTrigger1** pane for your *Function* appears.

1. In the command bar, select **Get Function Url**. The **Get Function Url** dialog box appears.

1. On the **default (function key)** select the *Copy to clipboard* icon at the end of the URL, and then select **Close** to close the dialog box.

1. In the address bar of a new browser tab, paste the function URL you copied. Press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to run the request in your browser. The response might take a couple of minutes as the function app initializes. If you receive a timeout error, refresh to resend the request.

   When the function responds, you should see output similar to the following example displayed in your browser.

    ```output
    This HTTP triggered function executed successfully. Pass a name in the query string or in the request body for a personalized response.
    ```

1. Add query string `&name=Joe` to the end of the URL. Your resulting URL should resemble the following example:

   `https://example.azurewebsites.net/api/HttpTrigger1?code=AbCdEfGhIjKlMnOpQrStUvWxYz==&name=Joe`  

1. Press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to run the request in your browser. When the function responds, you should see output similar to the following example displayed in your browser.

    ```output
    Hello, Joe. This HTTP triggered function executed successfully.
    ```

    As you can see from this exercise so far, you must define a trigger when you create a function. Each function has a single trigger. In this example, we're using an HTTP trigger, which means our function starts when it receives an HTTP request. The default implementation from the template, shown in PowerShell in the following screenshot, uses the `Push-OutputBinding` cmdlet to respond with the value of the parameter name that was part of the query string or body of the request. If no string was provided, the function responds with a message that prompts whomever is calling to supply a name value.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/3-default-http-trigger-implementation-powershell-small.png" alt-text="Code and Test pane for HTTP request showing response and respective binding parameters." lightbox="../media/3-default-http-trigger-implementation-powershell.png#lightbox)"::: <!-- no-loc -->

1. In the Function menu, select **Code + Test**. The **Code + Test** pane for your function appears, and displays the contents of your **run.ps1** file.

    The default PowerShell code for your function should resemble the following example.

    ```powershell
    using namespace System.Net
    
    # Input bindings are passed in via param block.
    param($Request, $TriggerMetadata)
    
    # Write to the Azure Functions log stream.
    Write-Host "PowerShell HTTP trigger function processed a request."
    
    # Interact with query parameters or the body of the request.
    $name = $Request.Query.Name
    if (-not $name) {
        $name = $Request.Body.Name
    }
    
    $body = "This HTTP triggered function executed successfully. Pass a name in the query string or in the request body for a personalized response."
    
    if ($name) {
        $body = "Hello, $name. This HTTP triggered function executed successfully."
    }
    
    # Associate values to output bindings by calling 'Push-OutputBinding'.
    Push-OutputBinding -Name Response -Value ([HttpResponseContext]@{
        StatusCode = [HttpStatusCode]::OK
        Body = $body
    })
    ```

1. Let's look briefly at the function's other file, the **function.json** config file. Open this file by selecting **function.json** from the filepath's dropdown list. The configuration data is shown in the following JSON listing.

    ```json
    {
      "bindings": [
        {
          "authLevel": "function",
          "type": "httpTrigger",
          "direction": "in",
          "name": "Request",
          "methods": [
            "get",
            "post"
          ]
        },
        {
          "type": "http",
          "direction": "out",
          "name": "Response"
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

    As you can see, this function has a trigger binding named **Request** of type `httpTrigger`, and an output binding named **Response** of type `http`. In the preceding code for our function, we saw how we accessed the payload of the incoming HTTP request through the **Request** parameter. Similarly, we sent an HTTP response simply by setting the **Response** parameter. Bindings really do take care of some of the burdensome work for us.

### Explore binding types

::: zone pivot="javascript"

1. In the **Function** menu, select **Integration**. The **Integration** pane for your function appears.

   Notice that a trigger and an output binding are already defined, as shown in the following image. The integration view adjusts to the best fit for the width and height of your screen. The same information can display horizontally, if your screen is wide enough.

   :::image type="content" source="../media/3-function-integration-vertical-small.png" alt-text="Screenshot of vertical flow diagram showing Trigger and Inputs leading to Function and Function leading to Outputs." lightbox="../media/3-function-integration-vertical.png":::

   You can see that we can't add more than *one* trigger. To change a trigger for a function, you need to delete the trigger and create a new one. However, the **Inputs** and **Outputs** sections enable you to add more than one binding, so the request can accept more than one input value and return more than one output value.

1. In the **Inputs** box, select **Add input**. The **Create Input** pane appears. Select the dropdown list for **Binding Type** to view a list of all possible input binding types.

   :::image type="content" source="../media/3-function-input-bindings.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Add input options.":::

   Take a moment to consider how you might use each of these input bindings in a solution.

   Later in this module, we add input bindings. For now, select **Cancel** to dismiss this pane.

1. In the **Outputs** box, select **Add output**. The **Create Output** pane appears. Select the dropdown list for **Binding Type** to view a list of all possible output binding types.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/3-function-output-bindings.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Add output options.":::

    As you can see, there are several output binding types. Later in this module, we add output bindings but, for now, select **Cancel** to dismiss this pane.

::: zone-end

So far, we learned how to create a function app and add a function to it. We saw a simple function in action, which is one that runs when an HTTP request is made. We also explored the Azure portal and the types of input and output bindings that are available to functions. In the next unit, we'll use an input binding to read text from a database.
