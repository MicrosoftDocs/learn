Suppose you run a social networking site for professionals. You're allowing your users to upload their headshot images to be posted on their profile. To reduce the workload on the web server, you want to create a serverless back end using Azure Functions to process this data. You want to create an image thumbnail, and then save it to permanent storage.

The power of Azure Functions comes mainly from the integrations that it offers with a range of data sources and services, which are defined with *bindings*. With bindings, developers interact with other data sources and services without worrying about how the data flows to and from their function.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you'll:

- Explore the types of data sources that can be accessed through bindings.
- Read data from Azure Cosmos DB by using Azure Functions.
- Store data in Azure Cosmos DB by using Azure Functions.
- Send messages to Azure Queue Storage by using Azure Functions.
