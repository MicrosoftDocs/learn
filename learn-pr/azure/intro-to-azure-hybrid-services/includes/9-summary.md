Tailwind Traders began the process of migrating some existing workloads to the cloud and ensuring that new workloads are cloud native where appropriate. Instead of having all workloads hosted on-premises or in Azure, Tailwind Traders are taking advantage of the technologies that best suit its needs.

In this module, you learned about various Azure hybrid technologies, including technologies related to networking, identity, compute, data, and security. You also learned how these technologies might function to provide Tailwind Traders with appropriate solutions to its problems. 

You learned about what hybrid cloud entails and the options for networking on-premises workloads to Azure in a seamless manner. You learned how to provide consistent identity across a hybrid environment, and you learned about the options for hybrid cloud compute workloads. Especially, the options for applications with tiers that are both in the cloud and on-premises. Finally, you learned about the options for managing files and data in the cloud, and the technologies for monitoring and managing the security configuration of hybrid clouds.
