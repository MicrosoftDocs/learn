  questions:

  - content: "Tailwind Traders needs to ensure that the volumes on file servers don't run out of disk space. At present, natural activity at Tailwind Traders offices weekly adds about 500 megabytes (MB) of data to the volumes that host important company information. Historically, this has meant that IT pros must remove about 100 gigabytes (GB) of old files every few months to allow enough storage space for new files. Tailwind Traders has configured Azure File Sync for all existing file shares, and the file shares have all replicated to corresponding Azure file shares. Which of the following strategies should Tailwind Traders pursue to ensure that it won't be necessary to remove disused files and folders from file servers in the future?"
    choices:
    - content: "Enable deduplication on each file server that's configured with Azure File Sync."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Although deduplication saves space, it won't stop all the available space on the file share from eventually being consumed."
    - content: "Enable cloud tiering on the Azure file share."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "You don't enable cloud tiering on the Azure file share, because the file share hosts the primary copy of all files. You enable cloud tiering on each file server that participates in Azure File Sync as a way of ensuring that the volumes that host the file shares don't run out of storage space."
    - content: "Enable cloud tiering on each file share that's configured with Azure File Sync on each file server."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "When you enable cloud tiering, you can specify an amount of free space that must be kept available or specify that files that haven't been accessed for a certain amount of time are automatically tiered, or both. If you specify that a certain amount of free space must be kept available on the volume, any time the limit is approached, the least recently accessed files on the volume will automatically be tiered to the Azure file share."

  - content: "Tailwind Traders currently provides clients with access to an important file server in the Sydney office by having them connect over a VPN. You're considering migrating those files to Azure. Which of the following solutions would allow those files to be accessible to internet-connected clients who have the appropriate credentials without requiring VPN access to the Sydney office?"
    choices:
    - content: "Azure Relay"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Azure Relay allows you to expose an application running on an internal network to clients on the internet. It does not function as a file share replacement."
    - content: "Azure File Share"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Azure File Share allows you to host an SMB 3.0 file share in Azure without requiring VPN access to a branch office. You can synchronize on-premises identities for authentication and authorization or use cloud-hosted identities for this purpose."
    - content: "Azure File Sync"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Azure File Sync does back on to Azure File Share, but it's used to sync the contents of file servers rather than as a client solution."
