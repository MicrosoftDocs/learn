Kusto Query Language (KQL) lets you explore your data to discover patterns, identify anomalies and outliers, and create statistical models. 

## Example scenario

Suppose you're a data analyst with a passion for meteorological data. You want to use KQL to explore a dataset for answers to basic questions about the kinds and locations of storms in the United States.

## What will we be doing?

You'll write simple queries in KQL to explore and gain insights from a sample dataset. You'll learn how to:

- Count the number of records by using the `count` operator.
- Return a specific number or rows by using the `take` operator.
- Select columns to return by using the `project` operator.
- Filter data by using the `where` operator.
- Reorder returned data by using the `sort` operator.
- Build queries by using multiple operators.

## What's the main goal?

By the end of this session, you'll be able to write a query with the most commonly used operators.
