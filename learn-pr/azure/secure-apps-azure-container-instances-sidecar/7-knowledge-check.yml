  questions:
  - content: "What's the best Azure Container Instances feature to do initialization tasks that an application requires?"
    choices:
    - content: Other Azure container instances running in parallel.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Init containers are better suited, because application containers wait for the init containers to finish before starting."
    - content: Init containers.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Init containers always run before application containers, to do initialization tasks or make sure application requirements are fulfilled."
    - content: Modify the application code to do initialization.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Init containers offer a more modular approach that doesn't require modification of the application code."
  - content: "How can sidecar containers communicate with other containers in the same container group?"
    choices:
    - content: "Use `127.0.0.1` as the destination IP address."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "All containers running in the same container group share the same IP address and networking stack."
    - content: "Use the Domain Name System (DNS) to find out the addresses of other containers in the group."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Finding out the addresses isn't required, because all containers in a container group share the same networking stack."
    - content: "They can't, because containers in a container group are isolated from each other."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Containers in a container group share the same networking stack, and can communicate with each other."
  - content: "Which images can you use to create sidecar containers?"
    choices:
    - content: "Only the same image as the main application container."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Sidecar containers can use different container images from the application container."
    - content: "Any container image from any image repository."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Containers in one container group can be instantiated from different container images, even from different repositories."
    - content: "Any container image that's from the same image repository as the application container."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Containers in one container group can be instantiated from different image repositories."
  - content: "What IP address(es) does an Azure container instance receive when it's deployed in a virtual network?"
    choices:
    - content: "Both a public IP address and a private IP address in the subnet where it's deployed."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The container instance receives only a private IP address, no public IP address."
    - content: "Only a public IP address."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The container instance receives a private IP address in the subnet where it's deployed, no public IP address."
    - content: "Only a private IP address in the subnet where it's deployed."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "The container instance is fully integrated in the virtual network."
  - content: "From where can you access Azure container instances deployed in a virtual network?"
    choices:
    - content: "Only from inside the virtual network."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Peered virtual networks and on-premises networks can also access the container instance."
    - content: "Only from inside the virtual network and peered virtual networks."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "On-premises networks can also access the container instance."
    - content: "From inside the virtual network, peered virtual networks, and on-premises networks connected over VPN or ExpressRoute."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Azure container instances deployed in virtual networks have the same connectivity as other resources, such as virtual machines."
