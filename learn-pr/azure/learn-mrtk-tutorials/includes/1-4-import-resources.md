## What is the Mixed Reality Toolkit?

The Mixed Reality Toolkit is an open-source cross-platform development kit that you can import into your Unity mixed reality project. While you can create Windows Mixed Reality apps without the Toolkit, we recommend that you take advantage of its components and features to accelerate your development. Here are some of its functions:

- Enables rapid prototyping via in-editor simulation that allows you to see changes immediately.
- Operates as an extensible framework that provides developers the ability to swap out core components.
- Supports a wide range of platforms, including
  - Microsoft HoloLens 2
  - Meta Quest (experimental)
  - Windows Mixed Reality (experimental)
