The Mixed Reality Toolkit (MRTK) is a cross-platform toolkit for building mixed reality experiences for Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR). The toolkit provides a set of components and features that you can use to accelerate your Windows Mixed Reality development.

Suppose you're creating a mixed reality experience in which the user needs the ability to move, rotate, and scale a holographic object. Although you could start from scratch with adding direct manipulation to holograms and configuring constraint through scripts, this can be time consuming, especially if you have multiple objects to configure.

In this module, you'll configure Unity for Windows Mixed Reality development and import the Mixed Reality Toolkit (MRTK) into your project. The Mixed Reality Toolkit includes an ObjectManipulator script that you'll apply to a cube for direct manipulation with hands.

By the end of this module, you'll be able to set up a Unity project configured for Windows Mixed Reality development and use the Mixed Reality Toolkit to accelerate your mixed reality development. You'll understand how to enable the user to manipulate holograms with their hands.
