  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: 'What is a benefit of normalizing data?'
    choices:
    - content: "Faster training times"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Training time is often faster when data is normalized."
    - content: "More accurate removal of missing values"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Removal of missing values isn't handled during normalization."
    - content: "Identification of preferential algorithms for training"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Normalizing data helps with training, but not with identification of algorithms."
  - content: 'A model you are training performs well on your training set, but poorly on your test set. What is likely happening?'
    choices:
    - content: "Underfitting has occurred, and your model isn't accurate enough. You should keep training."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Continuing to train your model when you already have good performance on your training set won't improve your performance. You need to find ways to improve performance on your test set."
    - content: "Overfitting has occurred, and your model isn't performing well on new data outside training. You could stop training earlier, or gather more diverse data."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Overfitting has likely occurred, and you can adjust your training to improve performance on your test set. You should consider if you need more diverse training data, or if you're training for too long."
    - content: "Your model is fine. You need to use your training data to test your model instead."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Your model needs to improve performance on your test data. You shouldn't replace the test data with your training data."
  - content: 'Your model is to be used in a challenging application, where you are required to have very reliable performance. What is an appropriate method to test your models reliability in difficult situations?'
    choices:
    - content: "Create a larger training set"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While creating a larger training set could help with increasing model performance, you should look at testing your model in other ways to ensure you meet performance thresholds."
    - content: "Use the hold-out approach and create a third, special dataset that's curated to include examples where your models output needs to meet performance thresholds."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. You can better test your models reliability in difficult situations with a third dataset that's specifically curated to measure reliability for your application."
    - content: "Keep a keen eye on your cost as you train. If you get any variability, you can stop training."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While keeping an eye on your cost during training can help prevent overfitting, you need to look for other ways to test your models reliability."
