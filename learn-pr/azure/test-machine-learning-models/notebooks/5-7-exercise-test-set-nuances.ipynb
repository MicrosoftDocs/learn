    " - When the train:test ratios are close, you are possibly leaving a lot of data out of the __training__ set, and that can have a negative impact on your model's performance.\n",
    " - When building models, it's important to test them using different train/test splits. Simply assigning more data to the *train* set doesn't always guarantee the best results.\n"
