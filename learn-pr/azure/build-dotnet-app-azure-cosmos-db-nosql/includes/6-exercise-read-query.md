Recall that your application is expected to both add items to an Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL container and read those same items back as validation. At this point, your application successfully adds items to the container. There are two key ways to read an item: by performing a point read, or by performing a query.

There are three key requirements at this time:

1. Point read an item using both the unique identifier and partition key value
1. Create a query using a simple query string
1. Paginate the results of the query using a feed iterator

:::image type="content" source="../media/project-visual-query.svg" alt-text="Illustration of icons indicating data being queried using a query." border="false":::

After you complete this exercise, your application will almost be ready. You have queries that can read the category and product items you previously created.

## Point read an item

The simplest way to retrieve an item in Azure Cosmos DB is to perform a point read. Point reads use a small and predictable number of RUs as compared to queries. Here, you point read the *helmets* single category item you created.

1. Return to the *Program.cs* file.

1. Create a new **PartitionKey** instance for `gear-climb-helmets`.

    ```csharp
    PartitionKey readKey = new("gear-climb-helmets");
    ```

1. Use **Container.ReadItemAsync** to point read a specific item by using the **id** property and the partition key value.

    ```csharp
    ItemResponse<Category> readResponse = await container.ReadItemAsync<Category>(
        id: "91f79374-8611-4505-9c28-3bbbf1aa7df7",
        partitionKey: readKey
    );
    ```

1. Get your serialized generic type using the **Resource** property of the **ItemResponse** class.

    ```csharp
    Category readItem = readResponse.Resource;
    ```

1. Output the unique identifier and request charge for the point read operation.

    ```csharp
    Console.WriteLine($"[Point read item]:\t{readItem.Id}\t(RUs: {readResponse.RequestCharge})");    
    ```

1. **Save** the *Program.cs* file.

## Execute a query

In situations where you need multiple items, you can use a query to find and retrieve those items. Recall that we used the **categoryId** partition key property to group our items into specific categories. If we include that property in a query, we effectively build a query that's scoped to a single logical partition. Now, you use a query to find all of the items in the *tents* category.

1. Create a new string for the query `SELECT * FROM products p WHERE p.categoryId = 'gear-camp-tents'`. However, use a parameter named `@partitionKey` for the **categoryId** filter.

    ```csharp
    string statement = "SELECT * FROM products p WHERE p.categoryId = @partitionKey";
    ```

1. Create a new instance of the **QueryDefinition** class with your query string.

    ```csharp
    var query = new QueryDefinition(
        query: statement
    );
    ```

1. Use the fluent **WithParameter** method to assign the `gear-camp-tents` value to the `@partitionKey` parameter.

    ```csharp
    var parameterizedQuery = query.WithParameter("@partitionKey", "gear-camp-tents");
    ```

1. Use **Container.GetItemQueryIterator\<\>** to retrieve an iterator for your specific query.

    ```csharp
    using FeedIterator<Product> feed = container.GetItemQueryIterator<Product>(
        queryDefinition: parameterizedQuery
    );
    ```

1. Write the query to the console.

    ```csharp
    Console.WriteLine($"[Start query]:\t{statement}");
    ```

1. **Save** the *Program.cs* file.

## Paginate query results

Azure Cosmos DB automatically breaks up your query results into pages that can be retrieves asynchronously. To manage these pages, you need to write your C# code in a specific way to ensure that you retrieve all pages of results that are available. Here, you'll use a *while* and *foreach* loop in C# to iterate over result pages.

1. Create a new *double* variable named **totalRequestCharge** set to a value of `0`.

    ```csharp
    double totalRequestCharge = 0d;
    ```

1. Create a *while* loop that iterates until the **FeedIterator.HasMoreResults** property of your feed iterator is false.

    ```csharp
    while (feed.HasMoreResults)
    {
    }
    ```

1. Inside of the *while* loop, get a new page of results using the **FeedIterator.ReadNextAsync** method.

    ```csharp
    FeedResponse<Product> page = await feed.ReadNextAsync();
    ```

1. Still inside of the *while* loop, increment the total request charge using the value of **FeedResponse.RequestCharge**.

    ```csharp
    totalRequestCharge += page.RequestCharge;
    ```

1. Still inside of the *while* loop, create a new **foreach** loop to iterate over the actual items in the page.

    ```csharp
    foreach (Product item in page)
    {
    }
    ```

1. Inside of the *foreach* loop, write to the console the **id** and **name** properties of the returned item.

    ```csharp
    Console.WriteLine($"[Returned item]:\t{item.Id}\t(Name: {item.Name ?? "N/A"})");
    ```

1. Outside of the *while* loop, write to the console the total request charge you calculated.

    ```csharp
    Console.WriteLine($"[Query metrics]:\t(RUs: {totalRequestCharge})");
    ```

    > [!TIP]
    > If you are unsure about what code should be inside or outside of the *while* and *foreach* loops, go to the **review code** section in [Check your work](#check-your-work).

1. **Save** the *Program.cs* file.

## Check your work

Your app now reads and queries items from the container. Here, you run the application so you can observe the results of both operations.

### [Run application](#tab/run-app)

1. Run the .NET application in the terminal

    ```dotnetcli
    dotnet run
    ```  

1. Observe the output of running the application. The output should match the example here.

    ```output
    ...
    [Point read item]:      91f79374-8611-4505-9c28-3bbbf1aa7df7    (RUs: 1)
    [Start query]:          SELECT * FROM products p WHERE p.categoryId = @partitionKey
    [Returned item]:        5df21ec5-813c-423e-9ee9-1a2aaead0be4    (Name: N/A)
    [Returned item]:        e8dddee4-9f43-4d15-9b08-0d7f36adcac8    (Name: Cirroa Tent)
    [Returned item]:        e6f87b8d-8cd7-4ade-a005-14d3e2fbd1aa    (Name: Kuloar Tent)
    [Returned item]:        f7653468-c4b8-47c9-97ff-451ee55f4fd5    (Name: Mammatin Tent)
    [Returned item]:        6e3b7275-57d4-4418-914d-14d1baca0979    (Name: Nimbolo Tent)
    [Query metrics]:        (RUs: 2.94)
    ```

    > [!TIP]
    > The RUs shown in this example output may vary from your output.

    Did you notice that your *category* item successfully deserialized into the type you use for *products*? Since the category item didn't have a **name** property, that property was left to its default value. Type checking, schema management, and serialization/deserialization are all things your application can manage entirely client-side.

### [Review code](#tab/review-code)

1. Review the *Program.cs* code file to make sure that your code matches this sample.

    ```csharp
    using Microsoft.Azure.Cosmos;
    using Microsoft.Azure.Cosmos.Fluent;
    using Microsoft.Azure.Cosmos.Linq;
    
    // Code to create client omitted for brevity
    
    // Code to create resources omitted for brevity

    // Code to create items omitted for brevity

    PartitionKey readKey = new("gear-climb-helmets");
    
    ItemResponse<Category> readResponse = await container.ReadItemAsync<Category>(
        id: "91f79374-8611-4505-9c28-3bbbf1aa7df7",
        partitionKey: readKey
    );
    
    Category readItem = readResponse.Resource;
    
    Console.WriteLine($"[Point read item]:\t{readItem.Id}\t(RUs: {readResponse.RequestCharge})");
    
    string statement = "SELECT * FROM products p WHERE p.categoryId = @partitionKey";
    
    var query = new QueryDefinition(
        query: statement
    );
    
    var parameterizedQuery = query.WithParameter("@partitionKey", "gear-camp-tents");
    
    using FeedIterator<Product> feed = container.GetItemQueryIterator<Product>(
        queryDefinition: parameterizedQuery
    );
    
    Console.WriteLine($"[Start query]:\t{statement}");
    
    double totalRequestCharge = 0d;
    while (feed.HasMoreResults)
    {
        FeedResponse<Product> page = await feed.ReadNextAsync();
        totalRequestCharge += page.RequestCharge;
        foreach (Product item in page)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"[Returned item]:\t{item.Id}\t(Name: {item.Name ?? "N/A"})");
        }
    }
    Console.WriteLine($"[Query metrics]:\t(RUs: {totalRequestCharge})");
    ```
