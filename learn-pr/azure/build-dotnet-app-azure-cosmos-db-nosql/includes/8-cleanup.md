After completing the project, you may wish to clean up your development environment or return it to its typical state.

## [GitHub Codespaces](#tab/github-codespaces)

Deleting the GitHub Codespaces environment ensures that you can maximize the amount of free per-core hours entitlement you get for your account.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For more information about your GitHub account's entitlements, see [GitHub Codespaces monthly included storage and core hours](https://docs.github.com/billing/managing-billing-for-github-codespaces/about-billing-for-github-codespaces#monthly-included-storage-and-core-hours-for-personal-accounts).

1. Sign into the GitHub Codespaces dashboard (<https://github.com/codespaces>).

1. Locate your currently running codespaces sourced from the [`azure-samples/dotnet-env-azure-cosmos-db`](https://github.com/azure-samples/dotnet-env-azure-cosmos-db) GitHub repository.

1. Open the context menu for the codespace and then select **Delete**.

## [Visual Studio Code](#tab/visual-studio-code)

You aren't necessarily required to clean up your local environment, but you can stop the running development container and return to running Visual Studio Code in the context of a local workspace.

1. Open the **Command Palette**, search for the **Dev Containers** commands, and then select **Dev Containers: Reopen Folder Locally**.

> [!TIP]
> Visual Studio Code will stop the running development container, but the container still exists in Docker in a stopped state. You always have the option to deleting the container instance, container image, and volumes from Docker to free up more space on your local machine.
