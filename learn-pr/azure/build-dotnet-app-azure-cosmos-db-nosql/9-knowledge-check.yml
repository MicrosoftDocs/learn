      Which block of code should be used to create a client to connect to the Azure Cosmos DB account with only a connection string?
    choices:
    - content: |
        ```csharp
        string connectionString = "<cosmos-connection-string>";
        using CosmosClient client = new(connectionString);
        ```
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: |
        Correct.
        This constructor only requires a single string parameter with the full connection string.
    - content: |
        ```csharp
        string connectionString = "<cosmos-connection-string>";
        using CosmosClient client = new(connectionString, "");
        ```
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: |
        Incorrect.
        This constructor requires two strings; one for the endpoint and another for the key. You incorrectly passed in the connection string for the endpoint parameter.
    - content: |
        ```csharp
        string connectionString = "<cosmos-connection-string>";
        using CosmosClient client = new();
        ```
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: |
        Incorrect.
        This constructor is used solely for mock testing.

      Consider a new Azure Cosmos DB account without any resources. Which block of code creates the first server-side resource that is required to store a set of containers?
    choices:
    - content: |
        ```csharp
        using CosmosClient client = new(
            connectionString: cosmosConnectionString
        );
        ```
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: |
        Incorrect.
        The client instance simply connects to Azure Cosmos DB. It doesn't create any resources.
    - content: |
        ```csharp
        Container container = await database.CreateContainerIfNotExistsAsync(
            "products",
            partitionKeyPath: "/department",
            throughput: 400
        );
        ```
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: |
        Incorrect.
        Containers must be created in a different type of resource within Azure Cosmos DB.
    - content: |
        ```csharp
        Database database = await client.CreateDatabaseIfNotExistsAsync(
            "adventureworks"
        );
        ```
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: |
        Correct.
        All containers must exist within a database that has been created within the Azure Cosmos DB account.
  - content: |
      An item already exists in the Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL account with a unique identifier of `04b3038c-b966-4a86-a1f3-5d1fa5c2a47c`. Which of the following blocks of code replace the existing item in the container with a newly created item without running the risk of creating an entirely new item.
    choices:
    - content: |
        ```csharp
        Item item = new("04b3038c-b966-4a86-a1f3-5d1fa5c2a47c", "item-category", "item-name", 0, true);
        container.UpsertItemAsync(item);
        ```
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: |
        Incorrect.
        While this method can replace an existing item, it can also potentially create a new item.
    - content: |
        ```csharp
        Item item = new("04b3038c-b966-4a86-a1f3-5d1fa5c2a47c", "item-category", "item-name", 0, true);
        container.ReplaceItemAsync("04b3038c-b966-4a86-a1f3-5d1fa5c2a47c", item);
        ```
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: |
        Correct.
        This method replaces an item that already exists within the container.
    - content: |
        ```csharp
        Item item = new("04b3038c-b966-4a86-a1f3-5d1fa5c2a47c", "item-category", "item-name", 0, true);
        container.CreateItemAsync(item);
        ```
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: |
        Incorrect.
        This method creates a new item and throws a conflict exception if an item already exists.
  - content: |
      Here's an Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL query: `SELECT * FROM container c WHERE c.partitionKey == 'some-category' ORDER BY c.id`. What is the language-integrated query (LINQ) equivalent of this query?
    choices:
    - content: |
        ```csharp
        using FeedIterator<Product> feed = container.GetItemLinqQueryable<Item>()
            .OrderBy(i => i.partitionKey)
            .ToFeedIterator();
        ```  
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: |
        Incorrect.
        This query incorrectly orders the results using the partition key.
    - content: |
        ```csharp
        using FeedIterator<Product> feed = container.GetItemLinqQueryable<Item>()
            .Where(i => i.id == "some-category")
            .ToFeedIterator();
        ```
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: |
        Incorrect.
        This query incorrectly filters using the unique identifier.
    - content: |
        ```csharp
        using FeedIterator<Product> feed = container.GetItemLinqQueryable<Item>()
            .Where(i => i.partitionKey == "some-category")
            .OrderBy(i => i.id)
            .ToFeedIterator();
        ```
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: |
        Correct.
        This query filters on the partition key and orders the results using the unique identifier.
