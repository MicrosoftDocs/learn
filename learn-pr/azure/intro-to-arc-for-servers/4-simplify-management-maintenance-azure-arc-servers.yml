  questions:
  - content:  "What is the simplest method to identify the operating system of an Azure Arc enabled server?"
    choices:
    - content: "Integrate the server with Azure Monitor and run a Log Analytics query."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. While it is possible to identify the required information, this would require extra administrative effort."
    - content: "Use Windows Admin Center to connect to each server."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. While it is possible to identify the required information, this would require extra administrative effort."
    - content: "Use the Azure Arc enabled servers blade in the Azure portal."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. The blade allows the administrator to readily identify server name, OS version, OS build, manufacturer, model, serial number, the number of CPU cores, and the amount of memory."

  - content: "What is the primary Azure Monitor-related benefit of Azure Arc enabled servers comparing with servers which are not Azure Arc enabled?"
    choices:
    - content: "The ability to capture diagnostic logs."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This functionality is available for both Azure Arc enabled servers and those which are not Azure Arc enabled."
    - content: "The ability to generate alerts."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This functionality is available for both Azure Arc enabled servers and those which are not Azure Arc enabled."
    - content: "The ability to deploy and configure the Log Analytics agent via VM extensions."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. VM extensions are not available for non-Azure servers which are not Azure Arc enabled."
