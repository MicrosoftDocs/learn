Over the course of this module, you explored key features of Azure Arc-enabled servers and the benefits they bring to customers like Contoso. You reviewed the primary use cases of Azure Arc-enabled servers and verified that it could help you manage Contoso's on-premises resources through Azure. 

Given Contoso's complex, global, and hybrid computing environment, you concluded that the optimal way to streamline its management was to use Azure Arc-enabled servers. With this approach, Contoso benefits from the centralized, at-scale management provided by Azure Arc, while still being able to retain on-premises workloads. Using Azure Arc-enabled servers also addresses challenges associated with the multicloud strategy that Contoso wants to pursue by centralizing management of resources across Azure and other clouds.

You also advise the CIO that Contoso could further apply Azure services such as Azure Monitor, Microsoft Defender for Cloud, Microsoft Sentinel, and Azure Policy. Cloud-based monitoring might even potentially eliminate the need for an on-premises monitoring system. With Contoso's existing Azure resources, this provides a uniform monitoring solution that seamlessly integrates with other Azure services.
