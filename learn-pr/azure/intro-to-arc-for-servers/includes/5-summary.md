Over the course of this module, you explored the features of Azure Arc-enabled servers and the benefits they bring to customers like Contoso. You reviewed the primary use cases of Azure Arc-enabled servers and verified that it allows you to integrate with Azure all of Contoso's on-premises resources. 

Given Contoso's complex, global, and hybrid computing environment, you concluded that the optimal way to streamline its management was to use Azure Arc-enabled servers. With this approach, Contoso benefits from the centralized, at-scale management provided by Azure Arc while still being able to retain some on-premises workloads. The use of Azure Arc-enabled servers also addresses challenges associated with the multicloud strategy that Contoso wants to pursue.

You also advise the Contoso CIO that Contoso could further apply Azure services such as Azure Monitor, Microsoft Defender for Cloud, Microsoft Sentinel, Azure Monitor, and Azure Policy. Cloud-based monitoring might even potentially eliminate the need for an on-premises monitoring system. With existing Azure resources, this provides a uniform monitoring solution that takes advantage of cloud hyperscale and seamlessly integrates with other Azure services.
