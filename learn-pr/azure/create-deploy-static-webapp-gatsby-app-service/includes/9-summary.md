You started with the challenge of addressing common problems in the web development space including SEO, page load speed and also ensuring you had a reliable architecture building out your app.

You evaluated the command-line tool Gatsby to address the above problems. Gatsby's approach is to produce a set of static pages that loads quickly and is easy for a search engine to index effectively.

Gatsby relies on React.js, GraphQL, and its in-memory data graph. Using JSON data from the in-memory graph, you can produce pages using React.js components with data and content from many sources.

You also saw how plugins extend Gatsby's capability in handling different types of content. Plugins can **source** content and data from almost anywhere during the build process and place it in the built-in Graph you've learned to query. Learning to leverage plugins will prove useful for the future as you can continue to build out your app from different kinds of content like Markdown, JSON, and even service endpoints among many other content sources.

Additionally, you've learned how Gatsby produces a **build**, a deployable set of files consisting of nothing but HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Building your app prepared it so it could be deployed almost anywhere.

Finally, you deployed your app. You learned about Azure Static Web Apps, a service that can host your Gatsby app in Azure. You used Static Web Apps to deploy your app in minutes.
