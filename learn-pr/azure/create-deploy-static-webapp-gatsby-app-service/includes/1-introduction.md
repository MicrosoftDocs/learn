Imagine you're working on an e-commerce site. You want to ensure that your product pages can be found through a search engine and that they load quickly. Regardless of what tech approach you choose, you want to ensure you use something that follows best practices for architecture. The frameworks and techniques you select should be commonly used so you can find help if you need it.

One way to approach building an app like this is to use a **Static Site Generator (SSG)**. With an SSG, you can assemble a static site from content and data in different places including JSON, XML, YAML files, a database, or a third-party service accessible through the Web. Because of this, producing these static pages can be a complex process. Using a static site generation tool to produce these static pages therefore becomes a necessity.

Once you've produced these static pages, you need to think about how to deploy them to the Web. To stay competitive, you can use a service that allows for easy and fast deployment of your pages. The less time you spend on configuring your app deployment, the more time you can spend on improving its features.

In this module, you'll use the Gatsby command-line tools to create a new web app. You'll create a page in the app and add content to it with Gatsby's querying tools. Lastly, you will deploy your app to the web using the Azure Static Web Apps service.

By the end of the module, you'll be able to create web apps with Gatsby and publish them to the web.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you will:

- Use Gatsby to create a static web app
- Add data to a page in the app with a GraphQL query
- Deploy your app to the web with Azure Static Web Apps
