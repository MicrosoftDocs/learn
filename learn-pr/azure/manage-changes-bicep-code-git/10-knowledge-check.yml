  questions:
  - content: Which of these statements is a benefit of using version control?
    choices:
    - content: You can manage multiple environments with a single template by using branches.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. Parameters provide a way to manage multiple environments with a single Bicep file.
    - content: You can view the history of your files and revert to a previous version.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. Version control enables you to track the changes to files and even roll back to a previous version.
    - content: You can create smaller reusable Bicep files.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. Bicep modules provide a way to create small, reusable Bicep files for specific purposes. You can then store these files in a version control system like Git.
  - content: You've been asked to try out a new Azure service. You're going to temporarily add it to a Bicep file that you've already created and added to your Git repository. What should you do?
    choices:
    - content: Create a new branch in your existing repository and make your changes on the branch.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. A branch will likely work well for making a temporary change to your file.
    - content: Initialize a new Git repository and add the updated file to that.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. You already have a Git repository, so you should work in that and add a branch.
    - content: Copy the file out of your Git repository and onto your desktop or another folder. Make the changes there.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. You should keep the file in your Git repository and use a branch to separate it from your current, known-good, template.
  - content: Your team has decided to adopt trunk-based development. Which of these statements is true?
    choices:
    - content: Trunk-based development eliminates the possibility of merge conflicts.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. You can still get merge conflicts, especially when multiple people make changes in your repository.
    - content: Trunk-based development encourages you to use long-lived branches.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. Trunk-based development encourages the use of short-lived branches.
    - content: Trunk-based development encourages you to use short-lived branches.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. Trunk-based development encourages the use of short-lived branches.
  - content: A colleague has created a repository on GitHub and has granted you access. You want to make a local copy of the repository so that you can add some Bicep files to it. Which of these commands should you run first?
    choices:
    - content: "`git clone`"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. The `git clone` command enables you to make a local copy of a repository that has already been created.
    - content: "`git pull`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. The `git pull` command retrieves the changes from a remote repository, but you have to set up your local repository first.
    - content: "`git remote add upstream`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. Because you're making a copy of a repository that's already on GitHub, you should use the `git clone` command.
