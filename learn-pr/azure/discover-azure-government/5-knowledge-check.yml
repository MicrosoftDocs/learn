  questions:
  - content: "How does Azure prevent unauthorized access to customer applications and data?"
    choices:
    - content: "Each customer's applications and data are stored on the separate physical hardware."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Azure is a multi-tenant cloud platform, so multiple customer applications and data are stored on the same physical hardware."
    - content: "Azure uses logical isolation to segregate each customer's applications and data from those of others."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Logical isolation prevents unauthorized access while allowing for the flexibility of cloud services."
    - content: "Customer data is “air gapped,” or physically disconnected from the public internet."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Customers may access their data through encrypted internet connections."
    - content: "Customers are advised not to store sensitive information in the cloud."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The cloud provides the levels of isolation, security, and confidence required to handle workloads across a broad spectrum of data classifications, including unclassified and classified data."
  - content: "What is a service to help automate compliance and cybersecurity risk management in cloud environments?"
    choices:
    - content: "Hyperscale public cloud."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Hyperscale public cloud provides resiliency in time of natural disaster and warfare."
    - content: "Logical isolation."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Azure uses logical isolation to segregate each customer's applications and data from those of others."
    - content: "Azure Stack Hub."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Azure Stack Hub is an on-premises, cloud-consistent experience for customers who can’t directly connect to the internet, or where certain workload types must be hosted in-country/region because of law, compliance, or sentiment."
    - content: "Azure Blueprints."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Azure Blueprints is a service that helps automate compliance and cybersecurity risk management in cloud environments."

    choices:
    - content: "Machine learning."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Machine learning is a data science technique that allows computers to learn to use existing data, without being explicitly programmed, to forecast future behaviors, outcomes, and trends."
    - content: "Synthetic data."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Synthetic data is data that is artificially created rather than generated by actual events."
    - content: "Confidential computing."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Confidential computing protects data from threats as it's being processed."
    - content: "Azure Stack Hub."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Azure Stack Hub is an on-premises, cloud-consistent experience for customers who can't directly connect to the internet, or where certain workload types must be hosted in-country/region because of law, compliance, or sentiment."
