  questions:
  - content: "How does Microsoft Azure prevent unauthorized access to customer applications and data?"
    choices:
    - content: "Each customer's applications and data are stored on the separate physical hardware."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Azure is a multi-tenant cloud platform, so multiple customer applications and data are stored on the same physical hardware."
    - content: "Azure uses logical isolation to segregate each customer's applications and data from those of others."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Logical isolation prevents unauthorized access while allowing for the flexibility of cloud services."
    - content: "Customer data is “air gapped,” or physically disconnected from the public internet."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Customers may access their data through encrypted internet connections."
    - content: "Customers are advised not to store sensitive information in the cloud."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The cloud provides the levels of isolation, security, and confidence required to handle workloads across a broad spectrum of data classifications, including unclassified and classified data."
  - content: "What is Compliance Manager?"
    choices:
    - content: "A tool that helps give customers insight into their own compliance performance."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Compliance Manager gives customers visibility into their own compliance performance with a risk-based score reference, but it has other key capabilities."
    - content: "A tool that helps customers understand how Microsoft complies with key standards."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect.  Customers can use Compliance Manager to get insight into how Microsoft implements controls specified in leading standards, but it has other key capabilities."
    - content: "A tool that can provide recommendations for customers to improve their data protection capabilities."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Compliance Manager provides recommended actions to improve data protection, but it has other key capabilities."
    - content: "All of the above."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct.  Customers can use Compliance Manager to get insight into their own compliance performance, how Microsoft implements controls specified in leading standards, and how customers can improve their data protection capabilities."
  - content: "Which of the following may provide solution for customers when Microsoft doesn't have an in-country cloud presence and can't meet data sovereignty requirements?"
    choices:
    - content: "Machine learning."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Machine learning is a data science technique that allows computers to learn to use existing data, without being explicitly programmed, to forecast future behaviors, outcomes, and trends."
    - content: "Synthetic data."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Synthetic data is data that is artificially created rather than generated by actual events."
    - content: "Confidential computing."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Confidential computing protects data from threats as it's being processed."
    - content: "Azure Stack Hub."
      isCorrect: false
