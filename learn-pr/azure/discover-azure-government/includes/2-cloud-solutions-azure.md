As government agencies look for tools and solutions to move their workloads to the cloud, they're faced with specific concerns around data residency, security, and isolation. Microsoft Azure provides public sector customers with the tools and flexibility to design solutions to fit their legal and technological requirements.

## Azure in the public sector

For governments and the public sector industry worldwide, Microsoft provides [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/), a public multi-tenant cloud services platform. A multi-tenant cloud platform implies that multiple customer applications and data are stored on the same physical hardware. Azure uses [logical isolation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-government/azure-secure-isolation-guidance) to segregate each customer's applications and data from those of others. This approach provides the scale and economic benefits of multi-tenant cloud services while preventing customers from accessing one another's data or applications.

A hyperscale public cloud provides resiliency in time of natural disaster and warfare. The cloud allows for failover redundancy and gives sovereign nations flexibility with global resiliency planning. Hyperscale public cloud also offers many features that incorporate the latest cloud innovations. These features, such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, IoT services, intelligent edge, help government customers increase efficiency and unlock insights into their operations and performance.

Using Azure's public cloud capabilities, customers benefit from rapid feature growth, resiliency, and the cost-effective operation of the hyperscale cloud. The cloud also provides the levels of isolation, security, and confidence required to handle workloads across a broad spectrum of data classifications, including unclassified and classified data.

## Safeguarding data with Azure

A multi-tenant cloud platform implies that multiple customer applications and data are stored on the same physical hardware. Azure uses logical isolation to segregate each customer's applications and data from those of others. This approach provides the scale and economic benefits of multi-tenant cloud services. At the same time, it prevents unauthorized access to customer applications and data. Azure is available globally in more than 60 regions and can be used by customers worldwide to meet data protection and privacy requirements.

Microsoft Azure provides strong customer commitments for data residency and transfer policies. Most Azure services allow the customer to specify the deployment region. For those services, Microsoft won't store customer data outside the customer specified geography. Customers can use extensive and robust data encryption options to safeguard their data in Azure and control who can access it.

Some of the options available to customers to safeguard their data in Azure are listed below:

* Customers can choose to store their most sensitive customer content in services that store customer data at rest in Geo.
* Customers can further protect their data by encrypting it with their own key using Azure Key Vault.
* Data encryption in transit helps protect data from interception.
* Azure is a 24 x 7 globally operated service; however, support and troubleshooting rarely require access to customer data.
* Customers who want added control for support and troubleshooting can use Customer Lockbox for Azure to approve or deny access to their data.
* Microsoft will notify customers of any breach of customer or personal data within 72 hours of incident declaration.
* Customers can monitor potential threats and respond to incidents on their own using Azure Security Center.

With Azure data protection technologies and intelligent edge capabilities (such as Azure Stack Hub and Azure Stack Edge), customers can process confidential and secret data in secure, isolated infrastructure. Options include Azure public multi-tenant regions or top-secret data at the edge, under the customer's full operational control.

Now let's take a closer look at how Microsoft Azure supports public agencies in complying with local data regulations.
