You're the system architect for a law firm. The firm asks you to migrate critical systems to Azure. Operations include the database of case histories, currently hosted by an on-premises SQL server and accessed from a desktop application. The SQL server also runs some custom in-house services to perform database maintenance. You decide that a solution based on Azure virtual machines (VMs) allows you to host your SQL server and continue using your custom services. You want to create an Azure virtual hard disk based on the contents of your existing on-premises server to ease migration.

In this module, you learn how to architect the optimal disk configuration for the VMs you create in Azure.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you'll:

- Create a virtual machine (VM)
- Configure and attach virtual hard drives (VHDs) to an existing VM
- Determine whether you need premium disks
- Resize disks for a VM
