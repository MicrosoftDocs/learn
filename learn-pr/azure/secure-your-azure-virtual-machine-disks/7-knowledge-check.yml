  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "When you enable Azure Disk Encryption (ADE) on a Windows virtual machine (VM), what does it use to encrypt the data on your virtual hard disks?"
    choices:
    - content: "DM-Crypt"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "DM-Crypt is used on Linux virtual machines."
    - content: "BitLocker"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Windows VMs are encrypted using BitLocker."
    - content: "Azure Key Vault"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Azure Key Vault is integrated with ADE to manage the disk-encryption keys and secrets."
  - content: "To use Azure Key Vault with ADE, what policy do you need to set?"
    choices:
    - content: "Configure an access policy to permit at least one security principal."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "You don't need to configure a security principal for ADE."
    - content: "Create an access policy to allow template deployment."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The template deployment access policy allows Azure Resource Manager to get secrets from the key vault when the key vault is referenced in a template deployment."
    - content: "Set the key vault access policy to support disk encryption."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "You must set the access policy on the Azure Key Vault to allow disk encryption with ADE."
  - content: "Suppose you create a new VM with a single OS disk and a single data disk. You use the default options when you create the VM. You don't have an Azure Key Vault set up in your subscription. Which option most accurately describes the encryption state of those disks?"
    choices:
    - content: "Both disks are unencrypted."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Storage Service Encryption (SSE) is enabled by default for new virtual hard disks. With SSE, Azure manages the keys and automatically decrypts data for any read operations without impact on performance."
    - content: "The OS disk is encrypted using Storage Service Encryption (SSE). The data disk is unencrypted."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Storage Service Encryption (SSE) is enabled by default for new virtual hard disks. With SSE, Azure manages the keys and automatically decrypts data for any read operations without impact on performance."
    - content: "Both disks are encrypted using Storage Service Encryption."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "All disks are encrypted using SSE by default. With SSE, Azure manages the keys and automatically decrypts data for any read operations without impact on performance."
