## Azure Table storage

Azure Table storage is a service that stores nonrelational structured data (also known as structured NoSQL data) in the cloud, providing a key/attribute store with a schemaless design. Because Table storage is schemaless, it's easy to adapt your data as your application's needs evolve. Access to Table storage data is fast and cost-effective for many types of applications, and is typically lower in cost than traditional SQL for similar volumes of data.

You can use Table storage to store flexible datasets, like user data for web applications, address books, device information, or other types of metadata your service requires. You can store any number of entities in a table, and a storage account can contain any number of tables up to the storage account's capacity limit.

## Azure Blob storage

Azure Blob storage is Microsoft's object storage solution for the cloud. Blob storage is optimized for storing massive amounts of unstructured data. Unstructured data is data that doesn't adhere to a particular data model or definition, such as text or binary data.

## Azure Storage Explorer

Azure Storage Explorer is an application that helps you to easily access the Azure storage account through any device on any platform, including Windows, macOS, or Linux. You can easily connect to your subscription and manipulate your tables, blobs, queues, and files. In addition to these, you can connect to and manipulate Azure Cosmos DB Storage and Azure Data Lake Storage as well.
