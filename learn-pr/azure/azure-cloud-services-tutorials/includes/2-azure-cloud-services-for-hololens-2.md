Azure Cloud Services is an example of a Platform as a Service (PaaS). Like Azure App Service, this technology is designed to support applications that are scalable, reliable, and inexpensive to operate. In the same way that App Service is hosted on virtual machines (VMs), so too is Azure Cloud Services.

## Azure Storage

Azure Storage includes object, file, disk, queue, and table storage. There are also services for hybrid storage solutions, and services to transfer, share, and back up data.

## Azure Custom Vision

With Azure AI Custom Vision (part of the Azure AI services) you can associate a set of images to Tracked Objects, train a machine learning model on the set you created, and detect the Tracked Object.

## Azure Spatial Anchors

Azure Spatial Anchors is a managed cloud service and platform that enables multi-user, spatially-aware mixed reality and augmented reality (MR/AR) apps for HoloLens, iOS devices with ARKit, and Android devices with ARCore.

## Azure Bot Service

Azure Bot Service is Microsoft’s artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot offered as a service on the Azure Cloud service marketplace.

Azure Bot Service offers the ability to add intelligent agents that are capable of conversation without having to commit the resources to develop one’s own AI. You can add the service to websites, apps, email, GroupMe, Facebook Messenger, Skype, Slack, Microsoft Teams, Telegram, SMS, Twilio, Cortana, and Skype for Business.

## InternetClient

Apps can receive incoming data from the Internet. InternetClient cannot act as a server and has no local network access.

## Microphone

Accesses the microphone’s audio feed, which allows the app to record audio from connected microphones.

## SpatialPerception

Provides programmatic access to spatial mapping data, giving mixed-reality apps information about surfaces in application-specified regions of space near the user. Declare the spatial perception capability only when your app will explicitly use these surface meshes, as the capability is not required for mixed-reality apps to perform holographic rendering based on the user’s head pose.

## InternetClientServer

Apps can receive incoming data from the Internet. InternetClientServer cannot act as a server, has no local network access, and enables peer-to-peer (P2P) scenarios where the app needs to listen for incoming network connections.

## PrivateNetworkClientServer

Provides inbound and outbound access to home and work networks through the firewall. This capability is typically used for games that communicate across the local area network (LAN), and for apps that share data across a variety of local devices.

## WebCam

Accesses the video feed of a built-in camera or external webcam, which allows the app to capture photos and videos.

> [!NOTE]
> The WebCam capability only grants access to the video stream. In order to grant access to the audio stream as well, the Microphone capability must be added.
