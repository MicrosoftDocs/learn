Azure Cloud Services is an example of a platform as a service (PaaS). Like Azure App Service, this technology is designed to support applications that are scalable, reliable, and inexpensive to operate. In the same way that App Service is hosted on virtual machines (VMs), so too is Azure Cloud Services. However, you have more control over the VMs. You can install your own software on VMs that use Azure Cloud Services, and you can access them remotely.

Suppose you're developing a Mixed Reality application that needs an enormous amount of resources from time to time. You plan to store these resources using Azure Cloud services. Unfortunately, you have a minimal idea about how to implement Azure Cloud services in your application.

In this five-part module series, you'll learn how to integrate several Azure Cloud services into a Unity project for HoloLens 2. With each consecutive chapter, you'll add new Azure Cloud services to expand the application features and user experience, while teaching you the fundamentals of each Azure Cloud service.
