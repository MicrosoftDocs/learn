Azure Bot Service is Microsoft's artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot service on the Azure cloud service marketplace. By using Azure Bot Service, one can add intelligent agents without committing resources to developing their own AI. You can add the service to websites, apps, email, GroupMe, Facebook Messenger, Skype, Slack, Microsoft Teams, Telegram, SMS, Twilio, Cortana, and Skype for Business.

The platform gives bot developers a software development kit (SDK) and tools to add bots to sites in the form of Azure Bot Builder. Bots made with the Azure Bot Builder are automatically added to Microsoft’s directory. Azure Bot services also support bots coded in Python, Java, JavaScript, and C#.

## Bot Framework Composer

Bot Framework Composer, built on the Bot Framework SDK, is an open-source IDE for developers to author, test, provision, and manage conversational experiences. It provides a powerful visual authoring canvas enabling dialogs, language-understanding models, QnAMaker knowledgebases, and language-generation responses to be authored from within one canvas. Crucially, it enables these experiences to be extended with code for more complex tasks such as system integration. Resulting experiences can then be tested within Composer and provisioned into Azure along with any dependent resources.

Composer is available as a desktop application for Windows, OSX, and Linux, also a web-based component that can be customized and extended to suit your needs. For example, authoring dialog experiences with a visual designer are more efficient. Moreover, they enable easier modeling of more sophisticated conversational experiences where context switching, interruption, and more natural and dynamic conversation flows are important. On the other hand, more complex activities such as integrating with dependencies such as REST Web Services are best suited towards code. Therefore, we provide an easy mechanism to extend Composer bots with code, bringing the best of both together.

## Azure function

Azure Functions is a cloud service available on-demand that provides all the continually updated infrastructure and resources needed to run your applications. You focus on the pieces of code that matter most to you, and Functions handles the rest. Functions provide serverless compute for Azure. You can use Functions to build web APIs, respond to database changes, process IoT streams, manage message queues, and more.

## LUIS

Language Understanding (LUIS) is a cloud-based conversational AI service that applies custom machine-learning intelligence to a user's conversational, natural language text to predict overall meaning, and pull out relevant, detailed information. LUIS provides access through its custom portal, APIs, and SDK client libraries.

## HTTP GET calls

The HTTP GET method requests a representation of the specified resource. Requests using GET should only be used to request data (they shouldn't include data).
