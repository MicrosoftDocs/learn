## Summary

In this module series we learned about:
* Features you'll implement and how **Azure Cloud** services tie in to make your *HoloLens 2* application happen. You added the required components into the project and prepared the scene for this module series.
* How Azure storage services can be used to persist unstructured data--in our case, **Tracked Objects**--and binaries in the form of thumbnail images for the **HoloLens 2** demo application on the cloud.
*  How Azure Custom Vision can be used to train images and use the classification service to detect images that match the associated **Tracked Object**.
* How Azure Spatial Anchors could save and retrieve the object location on HoloLens 2.
* How **Azure Cloud services** brought new and exciting features to your application.
You can now store data and images in the cloud with **Azure Storage**, use **Azure Custom Vision** to associate images and train a model, bring objects to a local context with **Azure Spatial Anchors**, and implement **Azure Bot Framework powered by LUIS** to add a conversational bot for a new and natural interaction pattern.
