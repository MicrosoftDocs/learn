      explanation: 'Incorrect. Log data uploads are optional, not mandatory.'
    - content: 'User auditing data'

      explanation: 'Incorrect. User auditing data is not a valid data type.'
    - content: 'Usage data'

      explanation: 'Correct. Upload of the usage data is required for billing purposes and is not optional.'
  - content: 'Which of the following steps are required in order to upload usage data to an Azure subscription when using an indirectly connected Azure Arc-enabled SQL Managed Instance?'
    choices:
    - content: 'Create a Microsoft Entra security group'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'Incorrect. Although you need to create a Service Principal to upload usage and metric data to an Azure subscription in the indirectly connected mode, there is no specific requirement to create a security group as part of the process.'
    - content: 'Run **az arcdata dc export**'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: 'Correct. The **az arcdata dc export** Azure CLI command exports usage data from the data controller, which then can be uploaded to Azure.'
    - content: 'Use **az arcdata dc update** to update the usage type data to the Azure subscription'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'Incorrect. You use the **az arcdata dc update** Azure CLI command to update configurations of a data controller.'
  - content: 'Which option is correct for enabling an Azure Arc-enabled SQL Managed Instance to use readable secondaries while minimizing costs in a production environment?'
    choices:
    - content: 'Deploying the General Purpose tier and choosing the option for development use only'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'Incorrect. General Purpose tier does not support secondaries. Development use is not suitable for a production environment.'
    - content: 'Deploying the Business Critical tier and choosing the option for development use only'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'Incorrect. Development use is not suitable for a production environment.'
    - content: 'Deploying the Business Critical tier and selecting the **I already have a SQL Server License** option'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: 'Correct. Using an existing SQL Server License can provide a discount when configuring an Azure Arc-enabled SQL Managed Instance to use readable secondaries.'
