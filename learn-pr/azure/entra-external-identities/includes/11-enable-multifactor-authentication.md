## Exercise - Enable multifactor authentication (MFA)

[Multifactor authentication (MFA)](/entra/external-id/customers/how-to-multifactor-authentication-customers) protects consumer identities by prompting them for a second verification method. Microsoft Entra Conditional Access brings signals together, to make decisions, and enforce security policies. For our groceries website, we'll enforce a Conditional Access policy that prompts for MFA. The Conditional Access policy targets all users without any condition.

> [!NOTE]
> You'll need at least the [Authentication Policy Administrator](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#authentication-policy-administrator) directory role to enable multifactor authentication.
>
> Do you have feedback? [Please let us know how your proof of concept project is going. We'd love to hear from you!](https://forms.microsoft.com/r/Um1E3Sexnk)

1. Start by creating a Conditional Access policy to secure the application. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com/) and browse to **Protection** > **Conditional Access**. Then, select **New policy**.

1. Give your policy a **Name**, for example *sign-in risk*.

1. Under **Assignments**, select the link under **Users**. Then, on the **Include** tab, select **All users**. On the **Exclude** tab, you can select users and groups for your organization's emergency access or break-glass accounts.

1. Under **Assignments**, select **Target resources**. Then, On the **Include** tab, choose the **Select apps** option and click on the **Select** button. Find your app, select it, and then choose **Select**.

1. Skip the **Conditions** section and move to the next step.

    [ ![Screenshot of New Conditional Access policy blade highlighting Conditions.](../media/enable-multifactor-authentication/5_inline.png) ](../media/enable-multifactor-authentication/5.png#lightbox)

1. Under **Access controls** > **Grant**, select **Grant access**. Then select **Require multifactor authentication**. With this grant type, users must complete additional security requirements like email, phone call, or text message.

    [ ![Screenshot of New Conditional Access policy blade highlighting Grant under Access controls and pane open on the right side titled Grant highlighting Require multifactor authentication.](../media/enable-multifactor-authentication/6_inline.png) ](../media/enable-multifactor-authentication/6.png#lightbox)

1. Confirm your settings and set **Enable policy** to **On**. Select **Create** to create your policy.

    [ ![Screenshot of New Conditional Access policy blade highlighting On for Enable policy at the bottom.](../media/enable-multifactor-authentication/7_inline.png) ](../media/enable-multifactor-authentication/7.png#lightbox)
    
    ***Well done!** You created a Conditional access policy that requires users to complete MFA. To check the user experience, sign-in to your application.*

#### Create conditional access policy
The following example creates a [conditional access policy](/graph/api/conditionalaccessroot-post-policies?view=graph-rest-beta&tabs=http). This policy targets all sign-ins for all users (except for the tenant's Global Administrator.) In the request below, replace the **{web-or-mobile-app-ID}** with your own web or mobile application (App ID, not object ID.) Note that you can add more applications.
