quiz:
  questions:
  - content: "Once onboarded, a cloud-connected sensor displays data on which system or systems?"
    choices:
    - content: "Defender for IoT in the Azure portal and the on-premises sensor interface."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Cloud-connected sensors send data to Defender for IoT in the Azure portal and display data on the sensor itself."
    - content: "Defender for IoT in the Azure portal only."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Cloud-connected sensors send data to Defender for IoT in the Azure portal, but also display data on the sensor itself."
    - content: "The on-premises sensor interface only. Cloud connections are supported for management purposes only, like defining settings or updating software."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Cloud-connected sensors display data locally, but also send data to Defender for IoT in the Azure portal."
  - content: "What is downloaded to the computer after you finish onboarding your sensor?"
    choices:
    - content: "You receive a list of endpoints."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. You'll also receive an activation file to download."
    - content: "You receive a certification file for the sensor."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. You'll receive the activation file to download."
    - content: "You receive the activation file for the sensor."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. You'll receive the activation file to download."
  - content: "What's the recommended action if you don't have your planned sites and zones created yet in Defender for IoT?"
    choices:
    - content: "Onboard your sensor with the default site and zone."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. We recommend that you onboard your sensor with the site and zone you have listed in your deployment plan. When onboarding your sensor, select Create site and Create zone to create them according to your plan."
    - content: "Stop the onboarding process and request the IT department to upload the site and zone information."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. You can create new sites or zones from the onboarding interface whenever you need to add them for the first time."
    - content: "When onboarding your sensor, select **Create site** or **Create zone** to create the sites and zones you've listed in your network diagram."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. You can create new sites or zones from the onboarding interface whenever you need to add them for the first time."
  - content: "What task is completed in the sensor onboarding phase rather than while planning or deploying your sensors?"
    choices:
    - content: "Add OT sensors to Defender for IoT on the Azure portal."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The onboarding sensors phase includes onboarding your OT sensors to Defender for IoT in the Azure portal."
    - content: "Upload an activation file to your sensors."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While the activation file is downloaded when your sensor is onboarded, you only upload the activation file to your sensor after it's deployed." 
    - content: "Plan your sites and zones."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. We recommend having a plan defined for your sites and zones before you start onboarding your sensors. That way, you'll know which site and zone you want to assign to each sensor."
