Onboard an OT sensor to Defender for IoT once you have a deployment plan and a prepared site. The site preparations include a detailed network diagram of all the sensors your organization needs, how they're divided by geographical sites and zones, and which connection method each one uses.

In a real-life scenario, you use a network diagram that your architecture team prepared of your environment to identify the site and zone to apply to the sensor you're onboarding.

Onboarding a sensor to Defender for IoT provides you with an activation file and a file listing all of the application end points. You use these at a later stage in the deployment process.

## Defender for IoT for OT deployment path

The following diagram shows the OT monitoring deployment path, with the team responsible for each phase:

This module describes the second phase in the deployment: *Onboarding sensors*. In a real-life scenario, you already have your deployment plan ready, and your networks and sites prepared.

Specifically, you need a list of the OT sensors planned for your deployment and how they're segmented into different geographical and logical sites and zones.

Real-life deployment plans and preparations also include details about your monitoring goals, the devices that need monitoring, and more. You'd make sure that all the appliances and hardware needed are already set up and working before onboarding the sensor.

This planning is essential for ensuring an effective Defender for IoT deployment across your system.

## In this phase

Sensor onboarding, described in this module, is the deployment phase where you log a specific sensor to Defender for IoT. In this phase you enter your Azure subscription, site and zone information.

In this module, you're onboarding an OT sensor to monitor traffic from a specific office at one of the car manufacturer sites in our sample scenario. When you're done, you have an OT sensor in Defender for IoT and an activation file to use with your sensor.
