Microsoft Defender for IoT provides comprehensive threat detection for IoT/OT networks, with multiple deployment options that include cloud-connected, fully on-premises, or hybrid environments.

This module describes the steps required to onboard a cloud-connected sensor to Defender for IoT for operational technology (OT) monitoring.

## Example scenario

Suppose you work for a car manufacturer that has offices and production sites across the globe. You're tasked with implementing a system to monitor traffic and secure your manufacturing automation systems, from the access panels to the pneumatic and packaging systems. To take the organization’s OT security visibility to a whole new level, your team chooses to use Microsoft Defender for IoT.

You’ve been tasked with onboarding an OT sensor to Microsoft Defender for IoT. You have the details for each of the sensors planned in your deployment. Now, you’ll take that information and onboard one of your planned sensors.

## What will we be doing?

In this module, you'll onboard an OT sensor to Defender for IoT. When you’re finished, you’ll download the sensor’s activation file and the list of endpoints required to connect your sensor to Azure.

## What is the main goal?

By the end of this module, you'll be able to onboard an OT sensor that you can connect to Azure and start monitoring detected traffic using Defender for IoT.
