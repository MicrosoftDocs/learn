  questions:
  - content: 'Which of the following characteristics is associated with the NVMe storage?'
    choices:
    - content: 'It attaches directly to the PCIe Bus.'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: 'Correct. The NVMe storage uses SSDs that attach directly to the PCIe bus.'
    - content: 'It uses platters and read/write heads.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'Incorrect. NVMe doesn’t use magnetic media for storage.'
    - content: 'It offers lower I/O throughput than SSDs.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'Incorrect. NVMe offers higher IOPS and I/O throughput with lower latency than SSDs.'
  - content: 'When using a combination of NVMe drives and HDDs, what is the default cache behavior?'
    choices:
    - content: 'Read and write'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: 'Correct. With HDDs, caching applies to both reads and writes.'
    - content: 'Read-only'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'Incorrect. With HDDs, caching isn’t set to read-only.'
    - content: 'Write-only'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'Incorrect. With HDDs, caching isn’t set to write-only.'
  - content: 'When using a combination of NVMe drives and SSDs, what is the default cache behavior?'
    choices:
    - content: 'Read and write'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'Incorrect. With SSDs as capacity drives, caching isn’t set to read and write.'
    - content: 'Read-only'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'Incorrect. With SSDs as capacity drives, caching isn’t set to read-only.'
    - content: 'Write-only'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: 'Correct. With SSDs as capacity drives, only writes are cached. This is intended to reduce wear on the cache drives, as performance gains from caching SSD reads would be relatively limited.'
  - content: 'When using a combination of NVMe drives, SSDs, and HDDs, what is the default cache behavior?'
    choices:
    - content: 'NVMe provides caching to SSDs and HDDs.'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: 'Correct. When using a combination of NVMe drives, SSDs, and HDDs, NVMe provides caching to SSDs and HDDs.'
    - content: 'NVMe drives and SSDs provide caching to HDDs.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'Incorrect. When using a combination of the three drives, NVMe drives and SSDs do not provide caching to HDDs.'
    - content: 'SSDs provide caching to NVMe drives and HDDs.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'Incorrect. When using a combination of NVMe drives, SSDs, and HDDs, SSDs do not provide caching to NVMe drives and HDDs.'
  - content: 'Which of the following configurations could most likely result in the stranded capacity of 5 TB?'
    choices:
    - content: 'Three-way mirror on three-drive volume, with two drives of 10 TB in size and the third one of 15 TB in size'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: 'Correct. This configuration could result in a stranded capacity if the first two drives are full.'
    - content: 'Three-way mirror on four-drive volume, with four drives of 5 TB in size'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'Incorrect. This configuration wouldn’t result in a stranded capacity of 5 TB.'
    - content: 'Three-way mirror on five-drive volume, with five drives of 5 TB in size'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'Incorrect. This configuration wouldn’t result in a stranded capacity of 5 TB.'
  - content: 'What is the maximum configurable CSV in-memory cache size?'
    choices:
    - content: '80 percent'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: 'Correct. The maximum configurable CSV in-memory cache size is 80 percent.'
    - content: '50 percent'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'Incorrect. The maximum configurable CSV in-memory cache size isn’t 50 percent.'
    - content: '10 percent'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'Incorrect. The maximum configurable CSV in-memory cache size isn’t 10 percent.'
  - content: 'Which technology provides the zero-copy networking functionality?'
    choices:
    - content: 'RDMA'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: 'Correct. RDMA provides the zero-copy networking functionality.'
    - content: 'RSS'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'Incorrect. RSS doesn’t provide the zero-copy networking functionality.'
    - content: 'NVMe'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'Incorrect. NVMe is a storage technology.'
  - content: 'What is the amount of time after which the Health Service in Azure Stack HCI will retire a disk that becomes inaccessible?'
    choices:
    - content: '5 minutes'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'Incorrect. The amount of time after which the Health Service will retire a disk that becomes inaccessible is not 5 minutes.'
    - content: '10 minutes'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'Incorrect. The amount of time after which the Health Service will retire a disk that becomes inaccessible is not 10 minutes.'
    - content: '15 minutes'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: 'Correct. The Health Service will retire a disk that becomes inaccessible after 15 minutes.'
