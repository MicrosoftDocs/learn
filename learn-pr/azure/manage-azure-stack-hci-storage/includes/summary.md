You’ve learned how you can use Azure Stack HCI software-defined storage to address the resiliency and performance needs of your business-critical workloads by providing:

- Hyper-converged infrastructure

- Multiple-node clustering

- Highly redundant disk configurations.

- High-bandwidth, low latency interconnect combined with multiple-tier storage. 

You explored the various considerations for designing, implementing, and managing Azure Stack HCI storage. You also learned how to further optimize the built-in functionality of Azure Stack HCI storage.
