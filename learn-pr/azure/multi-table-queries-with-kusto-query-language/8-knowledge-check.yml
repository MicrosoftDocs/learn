  - content: "Which operator returns a table with appended rows from multiple tables?"
    choices:
    - content: "The `lookup` operator"

    - content: "The `union` operator"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The `union` operator takes two or more tables and returns a table with all the rows appended."
  - content: "Which function should you use to capture the results of a tabular expression?"
    choices:
    - content: "The `materialize()` function"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The `materialize()` function captures the result of a tabular expression so that it can be referenced multiple times by the query without recalculation."
    - content: "The `cache()` function"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Kusto Query Language doesn't have a `cache()` function."
    - content: "The `let` statement"
