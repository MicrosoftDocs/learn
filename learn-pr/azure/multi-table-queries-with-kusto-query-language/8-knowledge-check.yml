  questions:
  - content: "Which `join` kind contains all columns and only matching rows from both tables?"
    choices:
    - content: "`kind=leftouter`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The `leftouter` kind contains all records from the left table and only matching rows from the right table."
    - content: "`kind=inner`"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The `inner` kind contains a row in the output for every combination of matching rows from the left and right tables."
    - content: "`kind=fullouter`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The `fullouter` kind contains all records from both tables with unmatched cells populated with `null`."
  - content: "Which operator returns a table with appended rows from multiple tables?"
    choices:
    - content: "The `lookup` operator"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The `lookup` operator extends the columns of a fact table with values looked up in a dimension table."
    - content: "The `join` operator"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The `join` operator merges the rows of two tables to form a new table by matching values of the specified columns from each table."
    - content: "The `union` operator"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The `union` operator takes two or more tables and returns a table with all the rows appended."
  - content: "Which function should you use to capture the results of a tabular expression?"
    choices:
    - content: "The `materialize()` function"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The `materialize()` function captures the result of a tabular expression so that it can be referenced multiple times by the query without recalculation."
    - content: "The `cache()` function"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Kusto Query Language doesn't have a `cache()` function."
    - content: "The `let` statement"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The `let` statement is used to set a variable name equal to an expression or a function but doesn't capture the result."
