title: Write multi-table queries by using Kusto Query Language
summary: Write advanced queries in Kusto Query Language to gain deeper insights by combining data from several tables. Learn how to use the table-level operators `lookup`, `join`, `union`, and `materialize`, and the new aggregation functions `arg_min` and `arg_max`. You'll also communicate these results visually in charts.
