In the preceding exercise, you used the `join` operator to find the total sales per product. In this exercise, you use the `lookup` operator to find the total sales per country/region.

## Use the `lookup` operator

Your sales team wants to know the company's total sales per country/region. You could use a `join` operator to get the customer and product information. However, this kind of query performs best when you use the `lookup` operator to get this information.

Recall that the `lookup` operator enriches a *fact* table with data from a *dimension* table. It's a bit like reading a book (fact table) and looking up unknown words in a dictionary (dimension table).

For this query, you start with the *SalesFact* table and use the `lookup` operator to get *Customer* data and add it to the resultant table.

In the following procedure, you build the query in stages to give yourself a better understanding of the result of using the `lookup` operator.

1. Run the following query to get 10 matching arbitrary rows from the *SalesFact* table and the *Customers* table.

    ```kusto
    SalesFact
    | lookup Customers on CustomerKey
    | take 10
    ```

    Take a look at the resulting list. Notice that the resulting table contains columns from the *SalesFact* table followed by matching columns from the *Customers* table.

1. Run the following query to get the total sales per country/region.

    ```kusto
    SalesFact
    | lookup Customers on CustomerKey
    | summarize TotalSales = count() by RegionCountryName
    | order by TotalSales desc
    ```

    Your results should look like those in the following image:

1. Take a look at the resulting list. Notice that the top sales are in the United States. Try modifying the query to show the total sales in the United States by state.

In the preceding unit, you used a *rightouter* `join` to get the total sales by product category. That query took 0.834 seconds to run. Now, write a query to get the same result by using the `lookup` operator and then compare the execution time.

1. Run the following query.

    ```kusto
    SalesFact
    | lookup Products on ProductKey
    | summarize TotalSales = count() by ProductCategoryName
    | order by TotalSales desc
    ```

    Your results should look like those in the following image:

    :::image type="content" source="../media/5-lookup-2.png" alt-text="Screenshot of lookup operator with total sales per product query and results.":::

    Notice that you get the same results but the execution time is 0.398 seconds. The faster execution time is because the `lookup` operator is optimized for this type of query.
