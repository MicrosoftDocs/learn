Organizations often collate different types of information from many sources. The information is stored in a large number of tables. Occasionally, you might need to join tables based on logical relationships between them, for deeper analysis or reporting. In the retail company scenario, you use tables for customers, products, and sales information.

In this module, you learn about various ways to combine data in Kusto queries to give your team members the information they need to increase product awareness and grow sales.

## Understand your data

Before you start writing queries that combine information from your tables, you need to understand your data. When you work with Kusto queries, you want to think of tables as broadly belonging to one of two categories:

- **Fact tables**: Tables whose records are immutable *facts*, such as the *SalesFact* table in the retail company scenario. In these tables, records are progressively appended in a streaming fashion or in large chunks. The records stay in the table until they're removed and they're never updated.
- **Dimension tables**: Tables whose records are mutable *dimensions*, such as the *Customers* and *Products* tables in the retail company scenario. These tables hold reference data, such as lookup tables from an entity identifier to its properties. Dimension tables aren't regularly updated with new data.

In our retail company scenario, you use dimension tables to enrich the *SalesFact* table with additional information or to provide more options for filtering the data for queries.

You also want to understand the volumes of data you're working with and its structure, or schema (column names and types). You can run the following queries to get that information by replacing *TABLE_NAME* with the name of the table you're examining:

- To get the number of records in a table, use the `count` operator:

    ```kusto
    TABLE_NAME
    | count
    ```

- To get the schema of a table, use the `getschema` operator:

    ```kusto
    TABLE_NAME
    | getschema
    ```

Running these queries on the fact and dimension tables in the retail company scenario gives you information like the following example:

| Table | Records | Schema |
|--|--|--|
| SalesFact | 2,832,193 | - SalesAmount (real)<br />- TotalCost (real)<br />- DateKey (datetime)<br />- **ProductKey** (long)<br />- **CustomerKey** (long) |
| Customers | 18,484 | - CityName (string)<br />- CompanyName (string)<br />- ContinentName (string)<br />- **CustomerKey** (long)<br />- Education (string)<br />- FirstName (string)<br />- Gender (string)<br />- LastName (string)<br />- MaritalStatus (string)<br />- Occupation (string)<br />- RegionCountryName (string)<br />- StateProvinceName (string) |
| Products | 2,517 | - ProductName (string)<br />- Manufacturer (string)<br />- ColorName (string)<br />- ClassName (string)<br />- ProductCategoryName (string)<br />- ProductSubcategoryName (string)<br />- **ProductKey** (long) |

In the table, we highlighted the unique identifiers *CustomerKey* and *ProductKey* that are used to combine records between tables.

## Understand multi-table queries

After analyzing your data, you need to understand how to combine tables to provide the information you need. Kusto queries provide several operators that you can use to combine data from multiple tables, including the `lookup`, `join`, and `union` operators.

The `join` operator merges the rows of two tables by matching values of the specified columns from each table. The resulting table depends on the kind of join you use. For example, if you use an *inner join*, the table has the same columns as the left table (sometimes called the *outer table*), plus the columns from the right table (sometimes called the *inner table*). You learn more about join kinds in the next section. For best performance, if one table is always smaller than the other, use it as the left side of the `join` operator.

The `lookup` operator is a special implementation of a `join` operator that optimizes the performance of queries where a fact table is enriched with data from a dimension table. It extends the fact table with values that are looked up in a dimension table. For best performance, the system by default assumes that the left table is the larger (fact) table, and the right table is the smaller (dimension) table. This assumption is exactly the opposite of the assumption used by the `join` operator.

The `union` operator returns all the rows from two or more tables. It's useful when you want to combine data from multiple tables.

The `materialize()` function caches results within a query execution for subsequent reuse in the query. It's like taking a snapshot of the results of a subquery and using it multiple times within the query. This function is useful in optimizing queries for scenarios where the results:

- Are expensive to compute
- Are nondeterministic

Shortly, you learn more about the various table merging operators and the `materialize()` function, and how to use them.

## Kinds of join

There are many different kinds of joins that can be performed that affect the schema and rows in the resultant table. The following table shows the kinds of joins supported by the Kusto Query Language and schema and rows they return:

| Join kind | Description | Illustration |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `innerunique` (default) | Inner join with left side deduplication<br />**Schema**: All columns from both tables, including the matching keys<br />**Rows**: All deduplicated rows from the left table that match rows from the right table | :::image type="icon" source="../media/2-join-inner-unique.png" border="false"::: |
| `inner` | Standard inner join<br />**Schema**: All columns from both tables, including the matching keys<br />**Rows**: Only matching rows from both tables | :::image type="icon" source="../media/2-join-inner.png" border="false"::: |
| `leftouter` | Left outer join<br />**Schema**: All columns from both tables, including the matching keys<br />**Rows**: All records from the left table and only matching rows from the right table | :::image type="icon" source="../media/2-join-left-outer.png" border="false"::: |
| `rightouter` | Right outer join<br />**Schema**: All columns from both tables, including the matching keys<br />**Rows**: All records from the right table and only matching rows from the left table | :::image type="icon" source="../media/2-join-right-outer.png" border="false"::: |
| `fullouter` | Full outer join<br />**Schema**: All columns from both tables, including the matching keys<br />**Rows**: All records from both tables with unmatched cells populated with null | :::image type="icon" source="../media/2-join-full-outer.png" border="false"::: |
| `leftsemi` | Left semi join<br />**Schema**: All columns from the left table<br />**Rows**: All records from the left table that match records from the right table | :::image type="icon" source="../media/2-join-left-semi.png" border="false"::: |
| `leftanti`, `anti`, `leftantisemi` | Left anti join and semi variant<br />**Schema**: All columns from the left table<br />**Rows**: All records from the left table that don't match records from the right table | :::image type="icon" source="../media/2-join-left-anti.png" border="false"::: |
| `rightsemi` | Right semi join<br />**Schema**: All columns from the right table<br />**Rows**: All records from the right table that match records from the left table | :::image type="icon" source="../media/2-join-right-semi.png" border="false"::: |
| `rightanti`, `rightantisemi` | Right anti join and semi variant<br />**Schema**: All columns from the right table<br />**Rows**: All records from the right table that don't match records from the left table | :::image type="icon" source="../media/2-join-right-anti.png" border="false"::: |

Notice that the default join kind is `innerunique`, and it doesn't need to be specified. Nevertheless, it's a best practice to always explicitly specify the join kind for clarity.

As you progress through this module, you also learn about the `arg_min()` and `arg_max()` aggregation functions, the `as` operator as an alternative to the `let` statement, and the `startofmonth()` function to assist with grouping data by month.
