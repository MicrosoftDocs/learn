Kusto Query Language (KQL) is the query language used by Azure Data Explorer, Real-Time Analytics in Microsoft Fabric, Log Analytics in Azure Monitor, Microsoft Sentinel, Microsoft 365 Defender, Azure Resource Graph, and Resource Manager, among other Microsoft products.
Querying data using KQL lets you gain insights about your IT, business, and security from large data sets you collect, in near real-time. 

## What will we be doing?

## What is the main goal?

By the end of this session, you'll be able to identify key features and query environments for using KQL.
