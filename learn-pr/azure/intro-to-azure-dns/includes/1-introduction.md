Azure DNS allows your organization to host and manage public and private DNS records. Azure DNS allows you to fully integrate your organization's public and private DNS namespaces with applications, services, and hosts that you deploy in Azure.

You're responsible for networking at Tailwind Traders, a new and expanding online commerce store. Tailwind Traders currently hosts its public DNS zone, tailwindtraders.com, on DNS servers managed by the company's domain registrar. The company has owned the DNS zone since before you configured the organization's Microsoft 365 subscription. You use the DNS registrar's tools to manage records associated with this public DNS zone. As the company is increasing the deployment of applications and services in Azure, you'd like to simplify the process of managing the public DNS records associated with those Azure applications. You'd like to avoid constantly shifting between Azure and the registrar's tools each time a new web application is deployed or modified.

This module explains what Azure DNS does, how it works, and when you should choose to use Azure DNS as a solution to meet your organization's needs.
