In this module you learned about Azure DNS, a cloud hosted service that allows you to host and manage public DNS zones and data. You learned about the type of scenarios where Azure DNS is an appropriate solution for your organization and how Azure DNS is likely able to meet Tailwind Trader's needs, especially when it comes to using a single set of tools to manage DNS rather than having to use their DNS registrar's management tools each time an alteration is made to one of their Azure applications or services. You also learned about the differences between public and private Azure DNS zones and the situations in which each option is appropriate.
