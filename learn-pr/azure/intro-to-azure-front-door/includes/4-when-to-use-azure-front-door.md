Now we discuss how to determine which Azure Front Door SKU is the best choice for your needs. Your organization wants to provide efficient, reliable, and optimized access to application content that's hosted in Azure. We review the following criteria:

- Scalability
- Security
- Pricing
- Content delivery

It's also important to consider several other Azure products you could use instead of Azure Front Door, including:

- **Azure Traffic Manager**: Provides DNS-based global routing. However, it doesn't provide for Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol termination, or *SSL offload*, per-HTTP/HTTPS request, or application-layer processing.
- **Azure Application Gateway**: Can load-balance between your servers in a region at the application layer.

## Decision criteria

You can use Azure Front Door to build, operate, and scale out your dynamic web application and static content. Remember, the following tiers are available:

- Azure Front Door Standard, which is content-delivery optimized.
- Azure Front Door Premium, which is security optimized.

The decision you make depends on whether you require the other features that Azure Front Door Standard and Azure Front Door Premium offer.

| **Criteria** | **Analysis**|
| --- | --- |
| **Scalability** | Does your organization scale-out content? Organizations that host scalable content benefit more from using Azure Front Door. |
| **Pricing** | Does your organization prefer a monthly charge for each policy or hourly billing? Do you want to pay extra charges for custom rules? Review the pricing considerations in the *Pricing* section later in this unit. |
| **Content delivery** | Do you require content optimization, without extensive security capabilities? Azure Front Door Standard is a good choice in this case. |
| **Security** | Do you have enhanced security requirements? Azure Front Door Premium is your best option. |

## Apply the criteria

To decide which product has the features you need, review the following criteria and the recommendations about which product meets them.

### Scalability

Organizations that don't host global, scalable web applications might not benefit from implementing Azure Front Door. However, if it builds, operates, and scales out dynamic web applications and static content, it can benefit from the use of the different Azure Front Door tiers.

- Define, manage, and monitor your web traffic's global routing.
