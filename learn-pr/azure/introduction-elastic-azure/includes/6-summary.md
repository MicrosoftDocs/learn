The goal of this module was to help determine if Elastic is the right solution for running your Linux workloads. We evaluated the following criteria:

- Preferred operating system (OS).
- Infrastructure control requirements.
- Search functionality.
- BI tool of choice.

We described the three options for deploying Elastic on Azure; Elastic Cloud, Elastic on Azure virtual machines, and Elastic on AKS.
