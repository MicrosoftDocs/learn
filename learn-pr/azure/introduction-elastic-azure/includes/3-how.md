## How Elastic deployment options complement your business  

It helps to consider your team’s process and any architectural or compliance requirements, when choosing your deployment method.  

- **Work style preferences**: Some teams gravitate toward managing Elastic deployments themselves because it provides them with greater control of certain elements. For example, they may prefer to control the type of Azure instances they can deploy or how much compute to provide Elastic instances. 
- **Architectural or compliance considerations**: Likewise, some Azure users prefer to deploy Elastic into their own Azure subscription/resources or cohost Elastic in the same Azure region as the rest of their ecosystem. If that’s the case for you, you should check to see which regions you’re targeting. Our fully managed Elastic Cloud on Azure is available in most Azure regions but not all. Elastic can be deployed on Azure AKS or virtual machines anywhere you choose.
