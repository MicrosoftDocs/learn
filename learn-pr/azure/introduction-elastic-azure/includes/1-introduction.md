Elastic adds search and visualization capabilities to Linux workloads.

## Example scenario

Imagine you work for a warehousing company with a dozen locations around the country. The company needs an application that will help employees track inventory by warehouse, search for items by name, and build reports and dashboards. Elastic on Azure provides that functionality built into it along with the convenience and benefits of running on cloud infrastructure.  

## What will we be doing?

Through the course of this module, we’ll look at the different ways you can deploy Elastic on Azure and help you decide how you can use it to:

- Connect with Microsoft and Azure services
- Enhance the search capabilities of your applications
- Visualize data for better business insights

## What is the main goal?

By the end of this session, you will be able to decide whether Elastic on Azure is the right migration option for your Linux workload.
