  questions:
  - content: "Which tier allows for quick restore operations on a backup?"
    choices:
    - content: "Snapshot Tier"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The snapshots of the VM/Azure Files/Azure Blobs/and so on are retained in the customer's subscription itself in a specified resource group. This ensure restores are quick, because the backup/snapshot is available locally to the customer."
    - content: "Standard Tier"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The Vault-Standard tier is an online storage tier that allows you to store an isolated copy of backup data in a Microsoft-managed tenant, thus creating an extra layer of protection."
    - content: "Archive Tier"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. In most cases, the older backup data is rarely accessed and is only stored for compliance needs. This data is stored in the archive tier."
  - content: "What tool can you use to manage backups spanning multiple workload types, vaults, subscriptions, regions, and Azure Lighthouse tenants?"
    choices:
    - content: "Azure Monitor"
      isCorrect: false

    - content: "System Center Data Protection Manager (DPM)"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect: DPM is used on-premises for data backup. While you can back up data that is backed up by DPM; it doesn't support this scenario."
    - content: "Backup center"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. You can use Backup center to efficiently manage backups spanning multiple workload types, vaults, subscriptions, regions, and Azure Lighthouse tenants."
  - content: "What must be present before you can back up an entire VM or content on an Azure VM?"
    choices:

    - content: "Microsoft Azure Backup Server (MABS)"
