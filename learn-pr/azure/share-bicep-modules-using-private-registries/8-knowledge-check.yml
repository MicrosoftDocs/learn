quiz:
  questions:
  - content: When you try to deploy the preceding Bicep file, Bicep gives you an error. What should you do to resolve the problem?
    choices:
    - content: Add a tag to the module path.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. The module path doesn't currently include a tag, so Bicep can't find the correct module file to use. Change the module path to something like `br:toycompany.azurecr.io/mymodule:v1`.
    - content: Sign in to Azure Container Registry.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. Bicep uses the sign-in details from the Azure CLI when it accesses the registry.
    - content: Add a module alias.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. A registry alias enables you to simplify the name of the registry in the module path, but it isn't required and won't resolve the error.
  - content: Suppose you create a registry alias named `MyToyCompany`. Which of the following module paths is a valid reference that includes the alias?
    choices:
    - content: >
          `br:MyToyCompany/mymodule:v1.0`
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. When you work with a registry alias, you need to use the format `br/AliasName:ModuleName:Tag`.
    - content:  >
          `br/MyToyCompany:mymodule:v1.0`
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. This is the correct syntax to refer to a module with a registry alias.
    - content: >
          `br::MyToyCompany/mymodule:v1.0`
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. When you work with a registry alias, you need to use the format `br/AliasName:ModuleName:Tag`.
  - content: In which of these situations should you publish a new version of your module to a private registry?
    choices:
    - content: You add some comments to your module.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. Comments in a Bicep file don't affect how the module behaves, so you don't need to publish a new version of the module.
    - content: You remove a mandatory parameter from the module.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. When you modify mandatory parameters for a module, this is a breaking change. You should publish a new version of the module.
    - content: You need to share your module with a colleague.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. You don't need to publish a new version of your module to share it with your colleagues. Instead, grant them access to the registry.
