Employees in a company who use different applications to get their job done are making several calls to their IT admin to be granted access to certain applications. The administrator can't keep up with the number of incoming consent requests and is unable to track and evaluate them properly. The administrator wants an easier way to track and respond to these requests to enable users to quickly and safely access applications.

When the administrator sets up the admin consent workflow, they're able to view and evaluate admin consent requests from a single location in the Azure portal. The response time is also shortened because they receive email notifications immediately a request is made. The users are able to access applications after their request is approved.
