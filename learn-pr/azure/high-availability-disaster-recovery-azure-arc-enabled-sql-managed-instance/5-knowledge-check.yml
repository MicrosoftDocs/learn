quiz:
  questions:
  - content: "Through which mechanism does Azure Arc-enabled SQL Managed Instance provide high availability for the General Purpose service tier?"
    choices:
    - content: "Kubernetes"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. With the General Purpose tier, Kubernetes provides the high-availability option."
    - content: "Contained availability groups"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Contained availability groups provide high availability for Business Critical tier deployments. The service tier affects the amount of time it takes to perform a failover."
    - content: "Azure Container Instances"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Azure Container Instances aren't used with Azure Arc-enabled SQL Managed Instance."
  - content: "Which option is valid for recovering an Azure Arc-enabled SQL Managed Instance database before an issue being experienced, allowing for recovering maliciously damaged or corrupt data?"
    choices:
    - content: "Performing a manual failover to a secondary replica in the primary site."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A manual failover doesn't recover a database to a point in time before the identified issue."
    - content: "Performing a point-in-time restore of the database to a state before the identified incident."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Doing so reverts the state of the database to a point in time before the identified issue."
    - content: "Performing a manual failover to a secondary site."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A manual failover won't recover the database to a point in time before the identified issue."
  - content: "Which command performs a failover to the secondary site when the Kubernetes cluster hosting the Azure Arc-enabled SQL Managed Instance in the primary site is lost?"
    choices:
    - content: "`az sql instance-failover-group-arc update --role secondary`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. You should use this command if the Kubernetes cluster in the primary site is available."
    - content: "`az sql instance-failover-group-arc update --role force-primary-allow-data-loss`"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. This command forces the chosen secondary to become the primary and implies the possibility of data loss."
    - content: "`az sql mi-arc update --preferred-primary-replica`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This command sets the new primary replica in the primary site. This action doesn't allow for failover to a secondary site."
  - content: "Azure Arc-enabled SQL Managed Instance provides built-in automated database backups. Which type of database isn't backed up as part of this built-in service?"
    choices:
    - content: "Master database"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Master database is automatically backed up."
    - content: "User database in full recovery model"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. User databases in full recovery model are automatically backed up."
    - content: "User database in simple recovery model"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Databases in the simple recovery model aren't supported in the automated backup."
