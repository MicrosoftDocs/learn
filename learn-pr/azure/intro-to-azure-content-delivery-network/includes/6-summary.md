In this module, you learned about Azure CDN, a service that allows you improve the speed at which content is accessed by client hosts around the world by placing website content files closer to where they're being accessed. You learned about how Azure CDN caching behavior functions, how you can configure geo-filtering for files to restrict POP access to specific locales, and how Azure CDN can automatically compress files to reduce the size of content that's transmitted to client hosts. You learned about the types of scenarios in which Azure CDN is an appropriate solution for your organization and how Azure CDN is likely able to meet Adatum's needs.
