  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
    - content: Applications based on which of the following Azure services are most likely to benefit from deploying and configuring Azure CDN?
      choices:
        - content: Azure Cosmos DB
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. Azure Cosmos DB can already be globally distributed and won't benefit from the deployment of Azure CDN.
        - content: Azure DNS
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. Azure DNS is already globally distributed and won't benefit from the deployment of Azure CDN.
        - content: Azure web apps
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: Correct. Azure web apps are likely to benefit from deploying and configuring Azure CDN because the web app content can be provided closer to requesting clients.  
    - content: Which of the following Azure CDN features would Adatum use to ensure that content hosted in the Australian POP that has been configured isn't accessed by client hosts in Europe?
      choices: 
        - content: Cache TTL
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. Cache TTL determines how long content remains at the Azure CDN before it's refreshed.
        - content: Geo-filtering
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: Correct. You can use geo-filtering to limit the access that client hosts in specific geographies have to Azure CDN content.
        - content: Session persistence
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. Compression allows some Azure CDN content to be transmitted to client hosts in a smaller size, which is then decompressed when consumed on the client host.
    - content: Which of the following applications architecture would most be enhanced with Azure CDN if the content hosted in that application was being accessed by client hosts around the world?
      choices:
        - content: A web application that streams video of live sports events.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. Live data is always changing, so storing cached copies for several days won't improve the application experience. If recordings of the events were made after the event concluded, this use case would benefit from Azure CDN.
        - content: A web application that performs live translation of spoken audio.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. A web application that performs live translation of spoken audio is unlikely to benefit substantially from having website content cached around the world.
        - content: A web application that displays pre-recorded videos.
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: Correct. Seeing pre-recorded videos in locations close to where they're being accessed will improve performance for client hosts accessing that content.
