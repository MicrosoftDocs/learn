        isCorrect: false
        explanation: Incorrect. Autoscaling is not primarily for enhancing network security.
      - content: Improving query performance
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: Incorrect. Autoscaling is not primarily for improving query performance.
  - content: What is the purpose of enabling Azure Log Analytics and Azure managed Prometheus in HDInsight on AKS?
    choices:
      - content: Real-time data streaming
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: Incorrect. Enabling Log Analytics and managed Prometheus is not primarily for real-time data streaming.
      - content: Analyzing cluster metrics, logs, and diagnostics
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: Correct. Log Analytics and managed Prometheus are used for analyzing cluster metrics, logs, and diagnostics.
      - content: Ensuring data encryption
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: Incorrect. Ensuring data encryption is not the primary purpose of Log Analytics and managed Prometheus.
      - content: Optimizing storage performance
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: Incorrect. Optimizing storage performance is not the primary purpose of Log Analytics and managed Prometheus.
  - content: How can alerts and notifications be configured in HDInsight on AKS for monitoring cluster health?
    choices:
      - content: Using Azure CLI commands
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: Incorrect. Alerts and notifications are not configured using Azure CLI commands.
      - content: Through Azure Log Analytics only
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: Incorrect. Alerts and notifications can be configured in the Azure portal, not just through Log Analytics.
      - content: Configuring in the Azure portal
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: Correct. Alerts and notifications are configured in the Azure portal.
      - content: Writing custom scripts
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: Incorrect. Custom scripts are not the primary method for configuring alerts and notifications.

  - content: How can resource utilization be monitored in HDInsight on AKS, and what action can be taken based on the monitoring results?
    choices:
      - content: Using Azure portal only; manually adjusting cluster size
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: Incorrect. Resource utilization is monitored using Metrics and monitoring, and adjusting cluster size can be automated.
      - content: Utilizing Metrics and monitoring in HDInsight on AKS
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: Correct. Metrics and monitoring are used to monitor resource utilization, and actions can be taken based on the results.
      - content: Exporting configuration settings via RestAPI
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: Incorrect. Exporting configuration settings is not related to monitoring resource utilization.
      - content: Applying custom Grafana dashboards
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: Incorrect. Custom Grafana dashboards are not the primary method for monitoring resource utilization.

  - content: What actions can be performed using the "Configuration management" blade in the Azure portal for HDInsight on AKS?
    choices:
      - content: Only exporting service configurations
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: Incorrect. Both updating existing configurations and adding new configurations can be done.
      - content: Only updating existing service configurations
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: Incorrect. Both updating existing configurations and adding new configurations can be done.
      - content: Both updating existing configurations and adding new configurations
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: Correct. The "Configuration management" blade allows updating existing configurations and adding new configurations.
      - content: Neither updating nor exporting service configurations
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: Incorrect. Updating and adding configurations can be done using the "Configuration management" blade.

  - content: How does Azure Managed Prometheus contribute to monitoring an HDInsight on AKS cluster?
    choices:
      - content: Collects and analyzes cluster metrics
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: Correct. Azure Managed Prometheus collects and analyzes cluster metrics.
      - content: Provides premade dashboards for cluster health
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: Incorrect. Azure Managed Prometheus focuses on collecting metrics, not providing dashboards.
      - content: Enables custom Grafana dashboards
        isCorrect: false

      - content: Integrates with Log Analytics
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: Incorrect. Managed Prometheus is a separate service and does not integrate with Log Analytics.

  - content: Once Log Analytics is configured at the cluster pool level, how can it be enabled for individual clusters within the same pool?
    choices:
      - content: By exporting configuration settings
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: Incorrect. Log Analytics is enabled during cluster creation, not by exporting settings.
      - content: By using Azure PowerShell only
        isCorrect: false
