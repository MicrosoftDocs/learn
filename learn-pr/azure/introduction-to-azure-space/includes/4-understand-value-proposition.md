With Azure Space, Microsoft is building a platform for space and non-space industry leaders to use to unlock new use cases and innovation.

## Azure Space strategy

Our strategy is:

- **Non-competitive**: We're building a powerful partner community that will enable innovation and collaboration across industry leaders using the Azure Space platform.

- **Multi-orbit**: By using a multi-orbit strategy, we can provide the best information and connectivity from both orbits. Our platform operates with NGSO (non-geostationary orbit) satellites for global coverage and low latency and GEO (geostationary orbit) satellites for use cases in high-density places.

- **Multi-vendor**: We work with multiple vendors to provide a wide range of capabilities and the best possible offerings for specialized use cases.

Broadly speaking, the business opportunities for Azure Space serve two categories of users:

- **Satellite Operators**: Operators fall into two main categories:
  - _Satellite communications (SATCOM) operators_, which provide communications capabilities over space
  - _Earth Observation satellite operators_, which produce data.

- **Enterprises**: Non-satellite-operating businesses that need to harness data and communication from satellites.

## Azure Space core principles

Satellite operators and end customers in both government and enterprise can use Microsoft's Azure Space platform. While the intended user for each product in the Azure Space portfolio varies, Microsoft's approach is to provide value for all users through these core principles:

- Our global network and infrastructure
- Support for classified environments
- Differentiated AI and machine learning offerings
- An approach rooted in partnership, not competition
- Advanced go-to-market channels that enable digital transformation
- A comprehensive space product portfolio that meets the needs of operators and enterprises
