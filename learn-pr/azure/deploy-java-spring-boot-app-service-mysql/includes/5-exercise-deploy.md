In this unit, you'll configure your Spring Boot application to be deployed through Maven. Then you'll create and deploy to an Azure App Service instance.

## Configure the Maven plug-in

The deployment process to Azure App Service automatically uses your Azure credentials from the Azure CLI.

Run the following Maven command to configure the deployment. This command helps you set up the App Service operating system, Azure subscription, and Java version.

```bash
mvn com.microsoft.azure:azure-webapp-maven-plugin:1.12.0:config
```

1. When you're prompted with the **Subscription** option, select a subscription by entering the appropriate number at the beginning of the line.
1. When you're prompted with the **Web App** option, accept the default option `<create>` by pressing **Enter**.
1. When you're prompted with the **OS** option, select `linux` by pressing Enter.
1. Choose the default Java version, 1.8, by pressing **Enter**.
1. At the last prompt, press **Enter** to confirm your selections.

    ```bash
    Please confirm webapp properties
    AppName : demo-1604579125693
    ResourceGroup : demo-1604579125693-rg
    Region : eastus
    PricingTier : PremiumV2_P1v2
    OS : Linux
    Java : Java 8
    Web server stack: Java SE
    Deploy to slot : false
    Confirm (Y/N) [Y]: Y

    ```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The default value for the region is `westeurope`. For the best performance, change the value to the region in which your database is located.

In your project's *pom.xml* file, change the following field. We've used `eastus` in this example, but use the region where you set up your resources in the previous exercise.

```xml
    <configuration>
        ...
        <region>eastus</region>
        ...
    </configuration>
```

## Deploy the app

The Maven deployment plug-in creates your Azure App Service server. It copies your JAR file to the application server's */local/site/wwwroot* directory. Finally, the plug-in starts your application by using your Spring Boot JAR file's embedded HTTP server.

Next, deploy your Spring Boot application to Azure by using the following command:

```bash
mvn package com.microsoft.azure:azure-webapp-maven-plugin:1.12.0:deploy
```

This screenshot shows the application deployed to Azure App Service:

## Test the Azure App Service application

When the deployment finishes, your application is ready at `http://<appName>.azurewebsites.net/`.

To test the application, you can use `cURL`.

As you redeployed your application, you cleared the database. Now you need to create a new to-do item in the database:

```bash
curl --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
    --request POST \
    --data '{"description":"configuration","details":"congratulations, you have set up your Spring Boot application correctly!","done": "true"}' \
    http://<appName>.azurewebsites.net
```

This command should return the created item:

```json
{"id":1,"description":"configuration","details":"congratulations, you have set up your Spring Boot application correctly!","done":true}
```

Retrieve the data by using a new `cURL` request:

```bash
curl http://<appName>.azurewebsites.net
```

This command returns the list of to-do items, including the item you created:

```json
[{"id":1,"description":"configuration","details":"congratulations, you have set up your Spring Boot application correctly!","done":true}]
```

> [!NOTE]
> You can also open the URL in a web browser to return the list of to-do items.
