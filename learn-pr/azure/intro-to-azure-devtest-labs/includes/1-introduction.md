The overhead of onboarding developers into new systems is getting more difficult and costly. Most modern systems can house multiple technology stacks, which often require a large setup and expensive environments. The same is true for creating development and test environments. Azure DevTest Labs can simplify and accelerate the process of creating virtual computing environments.

## Example scenario

Suppose you work for an e-commerce company that uses systems-enabling orders to be placed and processed by using many different technologies. Some of these systems are for offline processing and some are in real time. Your company wants to reduce the time and money it spends to onboard new developers by creating virtual machines that are set up with systems already configured and installed. The company wants to look at the options available with Azure.  

## Objectives of this module

By the end of this module, you'll be able to:
- Evaluate whether Azure DevTest Labs is appropriate for setting up virtual machine environments for your team.
- Describe how the resource-creation features of DevTest Labs work to automate developer onboarding and the creation of deployment environments.
