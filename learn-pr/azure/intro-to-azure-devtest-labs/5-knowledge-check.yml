  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "Your company wants to implement a custom image with a minimum of administrative effort. Which approach should you take?"
    choices:
    - content: "Use Azure Lab Services."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "You can't use Azure Lab Services for the practice environments, because it doesn't support custom VM images."
    - content: "Use Azure DevTest Labs."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Azure DevTest Labs supports custom images and provides tools that make it easy to control your resource usage."
    - content: "Configure a set of VMs by using a virtual hard disk (VHD) image you create."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This approach is likely to require much more administrative effort than using Azure DevTest Labs."
  - content: "Your company wants to use DevTest Labs to install a required React JavaScript framework on the custom VM image. Which approach should you use?"
    choices:
    - content: "Use artifacts."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "You can use artifacts to run installation scripts to set up your dependencies."
    - content: "Use formulas."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Formulas provide a base image as a starting point. They don't enable installation scripts."
    - content: "Deploy a shell script to each VM after it's provisioned."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This approach is likely to require much more technical effort than using artifacts."
  - content: "You want to cap the size of the VMs that can be created within a DevTest Labs environment. Which approach should you should use?"
    choices:
    - content: "Use formulas."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Formulas are a way of building VM images. They don't handle usage caps."
    - content: "Use environments."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Environments are templates that speed up image creation and associated PaaS resources. They don't handle usage caps."
    - content: "Use policies."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "You can assign a maximum VM size limit to the lab by using policies."
  - content: "Can you save money by using DevTest Labs to set up test environments in the cloud?"
    choices:
    - content: "Yes"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Using test environments in the cloud with DevTest Labs has several cost advantages. For example, you can set up servers with autoshutdown to save energy costs."
    - content: "No"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Setting up on-premises test environments can be costly, due to long approval processes and complicated system configurations."
