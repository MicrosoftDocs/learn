  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
 
  - content: "An administrator must select the disk type that provides the highest IOPS (Input/output operations per second) for a new virtual machine (VM). Which disk type should they use, assuming their region supports all disk types?"
    choices:
    - content: "Ultra Disk Storage"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Ultra Disk Storage disks offer the best performance of disk types on Azure."
    - content: "Standard HDD"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Standard HDD disks are a cost-effective solution, but Premium SSD disks and Ultra Disk Storage offer better performance."
    - content: "Premium SSD"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Premium SSD disks provide high performance, but they don't offer the best performance of all the available disk types in Azure."
 
  - content: "You’re running an application that requires 15,000 IOPS on an Azure VM. You provisioned one VM with the Standard_D8s_v3 tier. It provides 12,800 IOPS, a P30 operating system disk with 5,000 IOPS, and two P30 data disks with 5,000 IOPS each. Which of the following statements is true?"
    choices:
    - content: "You met the application’s demands."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The maximum IOPS the application gets is limited by the VM limits and is 12,800 IOPS."
    - content: "VM I/O capping prevents the application from receiving the demanding IOPS."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "The VM limits cap the application at the allotted 12,800 IOPS."
    - content: "Disk I/O capping prevents the application from receiving the demanding IOPS."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "All attached disks are P30 disks, which can handle 5,000 IOPS. So, they respond back with their requested amounts, but in this case, VM I/O capping prevents the application from achieving demanding IOPS."
 
  - content: "An administrator is creating an Azure VM by using Premium SSD disks to run a marketing application. You scheduled a planned marketing event, for which you require a sustained increase in disk performance. Which of the performance-scaling options should the administrator choose to meet the application requirements?"
    choices:
    - content: "Use disk bursting."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Although the administrator can use disk bursting to improve the application's performance, this option usually is used for unplanned scenarios."
    - content: "Change the performance tiers."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "An administrator can change the performance tier on Ultra Disk Storage and Premium SSD disks when they need to meet a higher performance demand."
    - content: "Use read/write caching on the disk."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Although caching generally improves IOPS performance, it can't be used in scenarios in which you need to change the performance tier for the disk."
