Containers offer a standardized and repeatable way to package, deploy, and manage cloud applications. Azure Container Instances let you run a container in Azure without managing virtual machines and without a higher-level service.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you'll:

- Run containers in Azure Container Instances.
- Control what happens when your container exits.
- Use environment variables to configure your container when it starts.
- Attach a data volume to persist data when your container exits.
- Learn some basic ways to troubleshoot issues on your Azure containers.

## Prerequisites

You need your own Azure subscription to run this exercise, and you might incur charges. If you don't already have an Azure subscription, [create a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you begin.
