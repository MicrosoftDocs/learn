By default, Azure Container Instances are stateless. If the container crashes or stops, all of its state is lost. To persist state beyond the lifetime of the container, you must mount a volume from an external store.

In this exercise, you mount an Azure file share to an Azure container instance so that you can store data and access it later.

## Create an Azure file share

First, you create a storage account and a file share. Later, you can make the file share accessible to an Azure container instance.

1. Your storage account requires a unique name. For learning purposes, run the following command to store a unique name in a Bash variable:

    ```bash
    STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME=mystorageaccount$RANDOM
    ```

1. Run the following `az storage account create` command to create your storage account:

    ```azurecli
    az storage account create \
      --resource-group learn-deploy-aci-rg \
      --name $STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME \
      --sku Standard_LRS \
      --location eastus
    ```

1. Run the following command to place the storage account connection string into an environment variable named `AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING`:

    ```azurecli
    export AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING=$(az storage account show-connection-string \
      --resource-group learn-deploy-aci-rg \
      --name $STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME \
      --output tsv)
    ```

    `AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING` is a special environment variable that the Azure CLI understands. The `export` part makes this variable accessible to other CLI commands that you run later.

1. Run this command to create a file share named **aci-share-demo** in the storage account:

    ```azurecli
    az storage share create --name aci-share-demo
    ```

## Get storage credentials

To mount an Azure file share as a volume in Azure Container Instances, you need these three values:

* Storage account name
* Share name
* Storage account access key

You already have the first two values. The storage account name is stored in the `STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME` Bash variable. You specified **aci-share-demo** as the share name in the previous step. Here, you get the remaining value: the storage account access key.

1. Run the following command to get the storage account key:

    ```azurecli
    STORAGE_KEY=$(az storage account keys list \
      --resource-group learn-deploy-aci-rg \
      --account-name $STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME \
      --query "[0].value" \
      --output tsv)
    ```

    The result is stored in a Bash variable named `STORAGE_KEY`.

1. As an optional step, print the storage key to the console.

    ```bash
    echo $STORAGE_KEY
    ```

## Deploy a container and mount the file share

To mount an Azure file share as a volume in a container, you specify the share and volume mount point when you create the container.

1. Run this `az container create` command to create a container that mounts `/aci/logs/` to your file share:

    ```azurecli
    az container create \
      --resource-group learn-deploy-aci-rg \
      --name aci-demo-files \
      --image mcr.microsoft.com/azuredocs/aci-hellofiles \
      --location eastus \
      --ports 80 \
      --ip-address Public \
      --azure-file-volume-account-name $STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME \
      --azure-file-volume-account-key $STORAGE_KEY \
      --azure-file-volume-share-name aci-share-demo \
      --azure-file-volume-mount-path /aci/logs/
    ```

1. Run `az container show` to get your container's public IP address:

    ```azurecli
    az container show \
      --resource-group learn-deploy-aci-rg \
      --name aci-demo-files \
      --query ipAddress.ip \
      --output tsv
    ```

1. From a browser, navigate to your container's IP address. You get this page:

    :::image type="content" source="../media/5-files-ui.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Azure Container Instances file share demo running in a browser." loc-scope="other"::: <!-- no-loc -->

1. Enter some text into the form and select **Submit**. This action creates a file that contains the text you entered in the Azure file share.

1. Run this `az storage file list` command to display the files that are contained in your file share:

    ```azurecli
    az storage file list -s aci-share-demo -o table
    ```

1. Run `az storage file download` to download a file to your Cloud Shell session. Replace **\<filename\>** with one of the files that appeared in the previous step:

    ```azurecli
    az storage file download -s aci-share-demo -p <filename>
    ```

1. Run the `cat` command to print the contents of the file.

    ```azurecli
    cat <filename>
    ```

Remember that your data persists when your container exits. You can mount your file share to other container instances to make that data available to them.
