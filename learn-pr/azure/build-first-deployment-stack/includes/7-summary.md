You and your team at the community bank decided to use deployment stacks to improve the lifecycle management of your Azure resources. 

To test the functionality and features of deployment stacks, you deployed resources for the bank's deposits application by creating and updating a deployment stack.

In this module, you learned how to create, show, list, update, and delete a deployment stack and its managed resources. Deployment stacks manage resources defined in the same ARM JSON templates, Bicep files, or template specs used in your Azure deployments. You created a deployment stack that manages an app service plan and web app, reviewed the configuration of the deployment stack, and verified its managed resources.

You reviewed the basics of the _action on unmanaged_ parameter, which determines how detached resources are handled. You then updated the deployment stack to include An Azure SQL server and database as new managed resources. Finally, you deleted the deployment stack and its managed resources.
