abstract: | 
  After completing this module, you'll be able to:
    - Create and deploy Azure resources using deployment stacks and Bicep
    - Update and delete Azure resources using deployment stacks and Bicep
prerequisites: |
  You should be familiar with using:
  - Azure, including the Azure portal, subscriptions, resource groups, and resources.
  - Bicep, including creating and deploying basic files.
  - Basic Azure PowerShell or AZ CLI commands.

  To follow along with the exercises in the module, you need the following software installed locally:
  - [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com).
  - The [Bicep extension for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-bicep).
  - Azure CLI [version 2.61.0 or later](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) or Azure PowerShell [version 12.0.0 or later](/powershell/azure/install-az-ps).

    > [!TIP]
    > You can use either the Azure CLI or Azure PowerShell to complete this module. If you're not sure which to choose, we recommend you use the [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

    > [!NOTE]
    > Azure CLI automatically installs the Bicep CLI. Azure PowerShell requires a manual installation. For more information, go to [Install Bicep tools](/azure/azure-resource-manager/bicep/install).
