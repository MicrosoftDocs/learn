  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: 'A CRON expression is a string that consists of six fields that represent a set of times. The order of the six fields in Azure is: {second} {minute} {hour} {day} {month} {day of the week}. Suppose you needed a CRON expression that meant "every day", what special character would you put in the {day of the week} position?'
    choices:
    - content: "/"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "A slash specifies an increment. For example, a */5 in the {seconds} field means every five seconds."
    - content: "&ast;"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "An asterisk specifies that every possible value should be selected. Having an asterisk in the {day of the week} field means that every day should be selected."
    - content: ","
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "A comma separates items in a list. For example, a 1,2,3 in the {month} field means select January, February, and March."
    - content: "&dash;"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "A hyphen specifies a range. For example, a 1-3 in the {month} field means select January, February, and March."

  - content: 'Suppose your Azure Function has a blob trigger associated with it and you want it to execute only when *png* images are uploaded. Which of the following blob trigger *Path* values should you use?'
    choices:
    - content: "samples-workitems/{name}"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The Path tells the blob trigger where it should monitor for changes, and if there are any filters applied. Adding a file extension to the Path specifies that uploaded files must have that file extension in order for the trigger to invoke the function."
    - content: "samples-workitems/{name}/png"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The Path tells the blob trigger where it should monitor for changes, and if there are any filters applied. Adding a file extension to the Path specifies that uploaded files must have that file extension in order for the trigger to invoke the function."
    - content: "samples-workitems/{name}?png"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The Path tells the blob trigger where it should monitor for changes, and if there are any filters applied. Adding a file extension to the Path specifies that uploaded files must have that file extension in order for the trigger to invoke the function."
    - content: "samples-workitems/{name}.png"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "The Path tells the blob trigger where it should monitor for changes, and if there are any filters applied. Adding a file extension to the Path specifies that uploaded files must have that file extension in order for the trigger to invoke the function."

  - content: 'True or false: an Azure Function can have multiple triggers associated with it?'
    choices:
    - content: "True"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Every Azure Function must have exactly one trigger associated with it. If you want to use multiple triggers, you must create multiple functions."
    - content: "False"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Every Azure Function must have exactly one trigger associated with it. If you want to use multiple triggers, you must create multiple functions."
