In this unit, we're going to create a function that accepts an HTTP request with a single string. The function returns a string back to the caller to represent success or failure. Let's continue by working on the function from the previous exercise.

## Create an HTTP trigger

Let's continue using our existing functions app and add an HTTP trigger.

1. Make sure you're signed into the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/learn.docs.microsoft.com?azure-portal=true) using the same account you activated the sandbox with.

1. On the Azure portal menu or from the **Home** page, under **Azure services**, select **All resources**.

1. Select your function app identified under the *Type* column. Your **Function App** pane appears.

1. Select the **Functions** tab in the center of the screen.

1. Select the **Create** button at the top of the **Functions** tab. This action starts the function creation process. The **Create function** pane appears.

1. In the **Select a template** section, select **HTTP trigger**, then select **Next**.

1. In the **Template details** section, in the **New Function** field, enter a name for the function. Scroll down and in the **Authorization level** dropdown list, select *Anonymous*, and then select **Create**. Your newly created Function pane appears.

1. In the taskbar at the top of the screen, select **Code + Test**, and review the autogenerated code to get an idea about what's going on. The *req* parameter represents the incoming request and contains a *name* parameter. Check to see if *name* has a value. If it does, we return a greeting. Otherwise, it continues to ask for a value.

## Get your function URL

Now that the HTTP trigger is created, let's get the function URL so we can begin to make a request.

1. On the top menu bar, select **Get Function Url**. The **Get Function Url** dialog appears.

1. In the **default (Function key)** field, select the **Copy to clipboard** icon.

## Issue a GET request to your HTTP trigger

Let's issue a GET request for the URL to see if we get a response.

1. Open a new tab in your web browser.

1. Paste the URL into the address bar.

1. Add a query parameter called *name* with your name to the URL; for example, `https://<your-webapp-name>.azurewebsites.net/api/HttpTrigger1?name=Jesse`

1. Press <kbd>Enter</kbd>, to submit the request.

1. The message, **Hello, Jesse. This HTTP triggered function executed successfully.** displays.
