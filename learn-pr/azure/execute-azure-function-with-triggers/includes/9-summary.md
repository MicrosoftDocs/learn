In Azure, a function only runs when something explicitly tells it to execute. In this module, we explored the timer, HTTP, and Blob storage triggers.

These three triggers are common triggers you can use to define your functions. Azure Functions provides a wide selection of both triggers and bindings that you can use to respond to connect your function code to Azure services and other partner services. Although each trigger type has specific requirements, the implementation and usage patterns are similar.
