  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:

  - content: "How are storage accounts used by Site Recovery to store data backups?"
    choices: 
    - content: "Site Recovery creates recovery services vaults."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Recovery services vaults are used to store backup data, VM configuration settings, and workloads."
    - content: "Site Recovery creates docker containers using storage accounts."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Docker containers aren't used. Site Recovery uses recovery services vaults to store backup data, VM configuration settings, and workloads."
    - content: "Site Recovery creates and stores managed disks."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Managed disks aren't used. Site Recovery uses recovery services vaults to store backup data, VM configuration settings, and workloads."

  - content: "Which four ways does Site Recovery protect virtual machine infrastructure?"
    choices: 
    - content: "Implements an organization's BCDR, enables automatic failover and recovery, automatically protects failed-over machines, and automatically manages backup storage."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Failover and failback are manual, not automatic. Using Site Recovery can help meet an organization's BCDR, but can't implement it as a whole. The backup and syncing are automatic."
    - content: "Creates snapshots and recovery points, replicates VMs to a secondary region, supports DR drills, and enables flexible failover/failback."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "These are the four main features of Site Recovery that will protect your VMs."
    - content: "Backs up VM disks locally and to a different region, automatically manages backup storage, creates a Microsoft Azure Backup Server (MABS), and mirrors workloads between primary and secondary regions."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "These are features provided by Azure Backup, not Site Recovery."
