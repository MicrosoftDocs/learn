    - content: "False"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation:  "Correct. The .NET Storage Client library is available as individual packages which target specific storage services such as Blob Storage or Queue Storage."

    choices:
    - content: "BlobClient"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "No. While the BlobClient class can accept a connection string, this class is scoped to a specific set of Blob Storage operations."
    - content: "BlobServiceClient"
      isCorrect: true

  - content: "How can you modify your call to the GetBlobAsync method so that you retrieve only blobs which start with a specific string?"
    choices:
    - content: "Add query syntax as a parameter to the GetBlobAsync method."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "No. There is no such parameter. Instead, use the prefix parameter to return only blobs whose name begins with a specific string."
    - content: "Use parameters which filter the types of blobs returned."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "No. While there are various parameters which can reduce the number of blobs returned, you can limit based on blob name only by using the prefix parameter."
    - content: "Specify a string prefix."
      isCorrect: true
