  questions:
  - content: 'Which configuration option is available only when implementing tenant virtual networks from Windows Admin Center?'
    choices:
    - content: 'VLAN ID'

      explanation: 'Correct. Virtual network configuration, unlike the configuration of logical networks, includes support for peerings.'
  - content: 'Which configuration option is available only when implementing tenant logical networks from Windows Admin Center?'
    choices:
    - content: 'VLAN ID'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: 'Correct. Tenant virtual networks, unlike virtual networks, rely on the use of VLAN.'
    - content: 'Address prefix'
      isCorrect: false
