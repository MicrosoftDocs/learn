Your company's new toy wombat is a success. However, the large amount of traffic to the website was causing performance problems and customer complaints. You needed to add a content delivery network, or CDN, to the website to help it better support the load. You wanted to do this in a reusable and composable way, because you knew that other websites and other projects in your company would also need a CDN in the future.

In this module, you learned how to create and use Bicep modules to make your Bicep code reusable, better structured, and composable. You learned about the importance of creating good parameters and outputs for your modules to ensure that they're easy to chain together and compose into other templates, or even other modules. You also learned how conditions can help add flexibility to your modules.

Now, you can easily add a CDN into any of the websites that you create, whether or not they're deployed from your website's main template. You can even use the template as a module in another deployment.
