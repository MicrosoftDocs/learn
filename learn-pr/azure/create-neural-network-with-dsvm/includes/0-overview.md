The **Data Science Virtual Machine** for Linux is a virtual-machine image that simplifies getting started with data science. Multiple tools are already built, installed, and configured to get you up and running quickly. The NVIDIA GPU driver, NVIDIA CUDA, and NVIDIA CUDA Deep Neural Network (cuDNN) library are also included, as are Jupyter and TensorFlow. All pre-installed frameworks are GPU-enabled but work on CPUs as well.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you will:

- Create a Linux Data Science Virtual Machine in Azure.
- Connect to the DSVM via remote desktop.
- Train a TensorFlow model to classify images as ones containing sushi and ones containing sandwiches.
- Use the model in a Python app.
