  questions:
  - content: "Can you create a Data Science VM with an operating system other than Linux?"
    choices:
    - content: "No"
      isCorrect: false
      incorrectExplanation: "There are other options for operating systems for the Data Science VM."
    - content: "Yes"
      isCorrect: true
      #TODO: Fix this - correctExplanation: "Great! Proceed to the next part of the lab."
  - content: "What should be copied in the Azure Portal to use to connect to the Data Science VM with client?"
    choices:
    - content: "IP Address"
      isCorrect: true
      #TODO: Fix this - correctExplanation: "Great! Proceed to the next part of the lab."
    - content: "Subscription name"
      isCorrect: false
      incorrectExplanation: "The subscription name isn't needed to connect to the VM."
    - content: "DNS name"
      isCorrect: false
      incorrectExplanation: "The DNS name isn't needed to connect to the VM."
    - content: "Virtual network/subnet"
      isCorrect: false
      incorrectExplanation: "The Virtual network or subnet isn't needed to connect to the VM."
  - content: "What do you need to perform transfer learning on the Data Science VM?"
    choices:
    - content: "Access to a large GPU"
      isCorrect: false
      incorrectExplanation: "While a GPU is great for retraining on images, it doesn't need to be large or required."
    - content: "Tensorflow installed"
      isCorrect: false
      incorrectExplanation: "Tensorflow is already installed in the Data Science VM so there's no need to install it again."
    - content: "Pre-trained model"
      isCorrect: true
      #TODO: Fix this - correctExplanation: "Great! Proceed to the next part of the lab."
    - content: "A very large set of data"
      isCorrect: false
      incorrectExplanation: "You don't need a large data set to use pre-trained models."
  - content: "What is the name of the tool to visualize Tensorflow models?"
    choices:
    - content: "Tensorview"
      isCorrect: false
      #TODO: Fix this - incorrectExplanation: ""
    - content: "Tensorvision"
      isCorrect: false
      #TODO: Fix this - incorrectExplanation: ""
    - content: "Tensorpanel"
      isCorrect: true
      #TODO: Fix this - incorrectExplanation: "Great! Proceed to the next part of the lab."
    - content: "Tensorboard"
      isCorrect: false
      #TODO: Fix this - correctExplanation: ""
  - content: "When executing the TkInter code for a GUI to test the model, what is the name of the Python script it calls to get results from the model?"
    choices:
    - content: "retrain.py"
      isCorrect: false
      incorrectExplanation: "This script was used earlier to retrain the model with our own images."
    - content: "classify.py"
      isCorrect: false
      incorrectExplanation: "This script was used to put the TkInter code into and run from."
    - content: "label_image.py"
      isCorrect: true
      #TODO: Fix this - correctExplanation: "Great! Proceed to the next part of the lab."
    - content: "results.py"
      isCorrect: false
      incorrectExplanation: "This script wouldn't exist and would result in an error."
