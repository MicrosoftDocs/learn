Durable Functions is an extension of Azure Functions that lets you perform long-lasting, stateful operations in Azure. Azure provides the infrastructure for maintaining state information. You can use Durable Functions to orchestrate a long-running workflow. Using this approach, you get all the benefits of a serverless hosting model while letting the Durable Functions framework take care of activity monitoring, synchronization, and runtime concerns.

Suppose your company has a manual approval process for project design proposals. You want to automate the process, but still involve humans. As a requirement, the workflow solution that you implement needs to be able to orchestrate activities of varying duration and should be cost effective. Since your business also runs on custom business logic, the solution must be flexible enough to run proprietary code.  

By the end of this module, you'll learn how to orchestrate a long-running workflow as a set of activities using Durable Functions.
