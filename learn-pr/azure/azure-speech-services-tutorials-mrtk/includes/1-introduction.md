In this module, we'll create a Mixed Reality application that explores the use of Azure Speech Services with the HoloLens. Azure Speech Services is the unification of speech-to-text, text-to-speech, and speech translation into a single Azure subscription.

Imagine a scenario where you're expected to build an application capable of translating your speech into other languages. You would want a brief overview of incorporating that feature in your application, and Azure Speech Services can provide that.

Upon completion of this module, we'll be able to use your device's microphone to transcribe speech to text in real time. In addition, we will be able to translate our speech into other languages and use the Intent-recognition feature to understand voice commands using artificial intelligence.
