## Natural language

Natural language processing (NLP) is a subfield of linguistics, computer science, and artificial intelligence concerned with the interactions between computers and human language. The primary focus of NLP is how to program computers to process and analyze large amounts of natural language data. The result is a computer capable of "understanding" the contents of documents, including the language's contextual nuances. The technology can then accurately extract information and insights contained in the documents and categorize and organize the documents themselves.

Challenges in natural language processing frequently involve speech recognition, natural language understanding, and natural language generation.

## Azure prediction resource for the conversational language understanding (CLU) app

Conversational language understanding (CLU) is a cloud-based conversational AI service that applies customized machine-learning intelligence to a user's conversational, natural language text to predict overall meaning, and pull out relevant, detailed information. CLU provides access through its custom portal, APIs, and SDK client libraries.

## Intents

An intent represents a task or an action the user wants to do. It's a purpose or goal expressed in a user's utterance.

## Entities

An entity is an item or an element that is relevant to the user's intent. Entities define data that can be extracted from the utterance and is essential to complete a user's required action.

## Utterances

Utterances are input from the user that your app needs to interpret. To train CLU to extract intents and entities from them, it's vital to capture different kinds of example utterances for each intent. Active learning, or the process of continuing to train on new utterances, is essential to the machine-learning intelligence that CLU provides. An utterance can have only one top-scoring intent, but it can have many entities.

## Intent recognition

Intent recognition (or _intent classification_) is taking a written or spoken input and classifying it based on what the user wants to achieve. Intent recognition forms an essential component of chatbots and finds use in sales conversions, customer support, and many other areas.
Intent recognition is a form of natural language processing (NLP), a subfield of artificial intelligence. NLP is concerned with computers processing and analyzing natural language; that is, any language that has developed naturally rather than artificially (for example: computer coding languages).
