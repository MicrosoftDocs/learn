In this module, you'll add speech translation to your project, which allows you to translate and transcribe your speech into three different languages.

1. In the Hierarchy window, select the **Lunarcom** object, then in the Inspector window, use the **Add Component** button to add the **Lunarcom Translation Recognizer (Script)** component to the Lunarcom object and configure it as follows:

    * Change the **Target Language** to a language of your choosing; for example: _German_.

2. If you now enter Game mode, you can test the speech translation by selecting the **Satellite** button. Then, when you say something, your speech will be translated into the chosen language and transcribed on the terminal panel:
