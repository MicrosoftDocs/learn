## Speech translation

Speech translation is how conversational spoken phrases are instantly translated and spoken aloud in a second language. Speech translation differs from phrase translation, where the system only translates a fixed and finite set of phrases that have been manually entered into the system. Speech-translation technology allows speakers of different languages to communicate. It's thus of tremendous value for humankind in terms of science, cross-cultural exchange, and global business.
