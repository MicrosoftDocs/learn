   using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;

   public static void Run(HttpRequest req, out object outDoc, ILogger log)
   {
     log.LogInformation($"C# Queue trigger function processed: {req.Body}");

     string requestBody = new StreamReader(req.Body).ReadToEnd();
     dynamic iotDataJson = JObject.Parse(requestBody);
     dynamic iotData = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject<dynamic>(iotDataJson.ToString());

     log.LogInformation($"{iotData}");

     outDoc = new {
       pk = iotData.device.id + "-" + iotData.timestamp.ToString("yyyyMMdd"),
       timestamp = iotData.timestamp,
       deviceId = iotData.device.id,
       temperature = iotData.device.telemetry.Thermostat_1o.temp.value
     };
   }
   ```
