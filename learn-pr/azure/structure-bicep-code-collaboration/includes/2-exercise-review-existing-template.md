In our scenario, you sit down to review your template with your colleagues from the quality control team.

As you work together through the template, your colleagues begin asking a series of questions about the structure and components of the file. They seem to have some confusion. Maybe your template could benefit from some improvements to make it more readable and easier to understand?

Take a look at the following template, which you're seeing for the first time. Do you understand what everything in the template is doing? How many issues can you find? What could you do to improve the template?

::: code language="bicep" source="code/2-template.bicep" :::

## Create and save the Bicep file

Throughout this module, you're going to improve this template by making changes, following best practices to make it easier to read and understand, and easier for your colleagues to work with.

First, you need to create the Bicep file and save it locally so you can work with it.

1. Open Visual Studio Code.

1. Create a new file called *main.bicep*.

1. Copy the preceding Bicep template and paste it into the file.

1. Save the changes to the file.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When you improve code by reorganizing and renaming it, the process is called *refactoring*. When you refactor code, it's a good idea to use a version-control system such as Git. With version control, you can make changes to your code, undo those changes, or return to a previous version.
>
> In this module, you're not required to use Git to track your file. It's a good idea to do so, however, so consider it an optional extra.
