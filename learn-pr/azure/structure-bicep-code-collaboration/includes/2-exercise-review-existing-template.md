You sit down with your colleague in the quality control team, and open up your template.

As you work through the template together, your colleague begins asking a series of questions about the structure and components of the file. They seem to be confused. Maybe your template could benefit from some improvements to make it more readable and easier to understand?

Take a look at the template below. You're seeing the template for the first time. Do you understand what everything in the template is doing? How many issues can you find? What could you do to improve the template?

## Save the Bicep file

Throughout this module, you'll improve the template. You'll follow best practices to make it easier to read and understand, and easier for your colleague to work with. First, you need to save the Bicep file locally so you can work with it.

1. Open Visual Studio Code.

1. Create a new file called *main.bicep*.

1. Copy the Bicep template above into the file.

1. Save the changes to the file.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The process of improving code by reorganizing and renaming it is called _refactoring_. When you refactor code, it's a good idea to use a version control system like Git. With version control, you can make changes to your code, undo those changes, or return to a previous version.

> In this module, we don't require that you use Git to track your file - but it's a good idea to do so, so consider it an optional extra.
