quiz:
  questions:
    - content: "If a Policy is applied with the deny option to a Resource group, what happens to already existing non-compliant resources in that group?"
      choices:
        - content: "The non-compliant resources get deleted."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Azure Policy does not delete Azure resources"
        - content: "No changes will be made to the resources themselves but they will be listed as non-compliant resources."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct. Azure Policy does not delete resources but you can always check for non-compliant already existing resources."
        - content: "The resources will have a read-only lock on them so that no changes can be made to them."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Azure Policies does not lock already deployed resources."
        - content: "The resources become unusable and cannot be used to connect to other resources."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Azure Policies does not render already deployed resources unusable."
    
    - content: "What happens when you have a Policy set as deny at the Subscription level and the same Policy set as audit at the Resource group level?"
      choices:
        - content: "The two Policies would cancel each other out and have no effect"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Policies do not cancel each other out when there is a conflict."
        - content: "The Policy set as audit would take effect."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Even though the resource group scope is closer to the resource than the subscription, the more restrictive Policy would take effect"
        - content: "The Policy set as deny would take effect."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct. The more restrictive Policy would take effect."
        - content: "You would get an error when you attempt to deploy the second Policy that contradicts the first one, so you would be unable to proceed."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Azure Policies do not prevent other Policies from being deployed because of a contradiction."

    - content: "You have an Azure Policy applied the the Subscription level, but one of your AKS clusters needs to be exempt from a specific policy, what's the best way to handle that?"
      choices:
        - content: "Move the AKS cluster to another Subscription and apply the Policy to the previous Subscription."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "This would solve the problem but may not work if that resource needs to stay in that Subscription for business reasons."
        - content: "Apply the Policy at the resource level to the resources that need to have it in that Subscription."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "You cannot apply a Policy at the resource level."
        - content: "Tell your coworkers not to deploy resources that are not compliant with that Policy and add it to your training manual."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "This may work but may require a lot of manual work. This is not the best option in this scenario."
        - content: "Add an exclusion to the AKS cluster Resource group that the Policy should not apply to."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct. Azure Policies allows you to add exclusions you can use to exempt certain resources from having to comply with the Policy."
