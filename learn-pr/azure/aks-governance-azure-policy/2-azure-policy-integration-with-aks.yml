quiz:
  questions:
    - content: "How do you assign an Azure policy to all your organization's subscriptions?"
      choices:
        - content: "Assign that policy to the root management group."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "The root management group contains all subscriptions. When you assign a policy to the root management group, this policy applies to all subscriptions."
        - content: "Create a policy initiative."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "A policy initiative is a way to group multiple policies together. It isn't a way to assign a policy to a scope."
        - content: "Assign the policy to the Entra tenant."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Azure policies can't be assigned to an Entra tenant. Azure policies can be assigned to management groups, subscriptions, and resource groups."
    - content: "How can you use Azure to ensure that all pods created in your Kubernetes cluster have requests and limits configured, and deny pods without those configurations from being created?"
      choices:
        - content: "Use helm to create new pods in the cluster."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Helm is a tool to package applications in Kubernetes. It doesn't block resources being created on a cluster."
        - content: "Assign an Azure policy to the resource group of the Kubernetes cluster."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "There's a built-in Azure policy to deny pods without requests/limits from being created."
        - content: "Run an automation job that deletes pods without requests and limits every hour."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Deleting doesn't solve the problem, since pods without requests/limits are still able to be created."
        - content: "Use role-based access control (RBAC) in Kubernetes."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "RBAC in Kubernetes defines who can execute certain actions in the cluster. It doesn't inspect the resources being created and doesn't check policy."
    - content: "You assign the policy 'Kubernetes cluster containers should only use allowed images' to the resource group of your Kubernetes cluster. What happens to existing pods not using allowed images?"
      choices:
        - content: "Azure policy deletes the incompliant pods."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Azure policy doesn't delete incompliant resources. It denies new incompliant pods."
        - content: "The pods are marked as incompliant in Azure policy."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Azure policy reports incompliant pods and denies new incompliant pods from being created."
