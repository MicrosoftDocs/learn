quiz:
  questions:
    - content: "How do you assign an Azure policy to all your organization's subscriptions?"
      choices:
        - content: "Assign that policy to the root management group."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "The root management group contains all subscriptions. By assigning a policy to the root management group, this policy will apply to all subscriptions."
        - content: "Create a policy initiative."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "A policy initiative is a way to group multiple policies together. It is not a way to assign a policy to a scope."
        - content: "Assign the policy to the AAD tenant."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Azure policies cannot be assigned to an AAD tenant. Azure policies can be assigned to management groups, subscriptions and resource groups."
    - content: "You need to ensure that all pods created in your Kubernetes cluster have requests and limits configured, and deny pods without those from being created. How can you do this in Azure?"
      choices:
        - content: "Use helm to create new pods in the cluster."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Helm is a tool to package applications in Kubernetes. It doesn't block resources being created on a cluster."
        - content: "Assign an Azure policy to the resource group of the Kubernetes cluster."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "There is a built-in Azure policy to deny pods without requests/limits from being created."
        - content: "Run an automation job to every hour delete pods without requests and limits."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "This does not solve the problem, since pods without requests/limits still are able to be created."
        - content: "Use RBAC in Kubernetes."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "RBAC in Kubernetes defines who can execute certain actions in the cluster. It does not inspect the resources being created and does not check policy."
    - content: "You assign the policy 'Kubernetes cluster containers should only use allowed images' to the resource group of your Kubernetes cluster. What happens to existing pods not using allowed images?"
      choices:
        - content: "Azure policy will delete the incompliant pods."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Azure policy will not delete incompliant resources. It will deny new incompliant pods."
        - content: "The pods will be marked as incompliant in Azure policy."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Azure policy will report incompliant pods and deny new incompliant pods from being created."
