Imagine that you work for a browser based video game company. After a few months of planning, your team successfully migrated its technology stack to Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).

You just came out of a review with the security and compliance teams. They expressed concerns about the compliance status of your cluster. For example, they only want you to deploy images from trusted registries.

You need to be able to block new deployments from untrusted registries, and present a report of the status of your cluster against that policy. It's up to you to find out how you can meet this requirement and present a solution to the security and compliance teams.

In this module, you learn how to govern your AKS cluster using Azure Policy for Kubernetes.
