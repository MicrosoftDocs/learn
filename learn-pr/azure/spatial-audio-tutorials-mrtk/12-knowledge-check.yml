      choices:
        - content: "ARKit XR Plugin"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: The ARKit XR Plugin implements the native iOS endpoints required for building Handheld AR apps using Unity's multi-platform XR API.

          isCorrect: false
          explanation: The Oculus XR Plugin enables you to build applications for Oculus devices.
        - content: "Microsoft spatializer plugin"
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: The Microsoft spatializer plugin provides an easy way for your application to take advantage of the dedicated HRTF hardware so your application can use more of the application processor for operations other than spatial audio.
    - content: "What do you need to adjust in the Audio Source component to disable attenuation?"
      choices:
        - content: "Spatial Blend"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Sets how much the 3D engine has an effect on the audio source.
        - content: "Volume curve"
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: Unity will attenuate spatialized sounds as they get farther from the listener. To disable this attenuation, you need to adjust the Volume curve In the Audio Source component.

          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Determines how much doppler effect will be applied to this audio source (if is set to 0, then no effect is applied).

      choices:
        - content: "dry path, wet path"
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: In audio terminology, the original, unreverberated audio is called the dry path, and the audio after filtering with the reverb filter is called the wet path.
        - content: "wet path, dry path"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: In audio terminology, the original, unreverberated audio is called the dry path, and the audio after filtering with the reverb filter is called the wet path.
