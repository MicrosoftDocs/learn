          isCorrect: true
          explanation: The Microsoft spatializer plugin provides an easy way for your application to take advantage of the dedicated HRTF hardware so your application can use more of the application processor for operations other than spatial audio.
    - content: "What do you need to adjust in the Audio Source component to disable attenuation?"
      choices:
        - content: "Spatial Blend"
          isCorrect: false
