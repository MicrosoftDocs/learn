Through this module series, you'll learn how to use head-related transfer function (HRTF) offload on HoloLens 2 and how to enable reverb when using HRTF offload. Spatial audio is a way of creating sound in 360 degrees around a listener. Sound can come from any place in a sphere. It takes two forms - binaural and object-based. Binaural sound is used in headphones. Object-based sound is for television, radio and loudspeaker listening.

## Learning objectives

* Importing and Enabling Microsoft spatializer plugin
* Enabling Spatial audio on your developer workstation
* Add and Spatialize the button click sounds

* Play the video onto a quadrangle
* Route audio from the video to the quadrangle, and spatialize the audio
* Add a new script to control spatialization on a game object
* Drive the spatialization control script from button actions
* Improve perceived distance of sound sources by adding reverb.
* Control perceived distance of the sound using the listener's distance to the hologram.
