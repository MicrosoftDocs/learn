In this module, you've learned to import and enable the Microsoft Spatializer plugin and enable the spatial audio on your workstation. You also learned to spatialize the button's interaction sounds and use an audio clip to test button interaction. In addition, you learned how to enable and disable spatialization at run time and test out the app on a HoloLens 2 or in the Unity editor. In the app, you can now select the button to activate and deactivate the spatialization of the audio.

## Next steps

You can continue working on different types of audio. Consider trying the following interactions:

* Try incorporating Spatial audio to communication tools.
* Add spatial audio to your already built immersive application.
