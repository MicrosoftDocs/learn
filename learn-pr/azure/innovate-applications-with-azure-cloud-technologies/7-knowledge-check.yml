  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:

  - content: "What are the main phases of the innovation lifecycle?"
    choices:
    - content: The waterfall process
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The waterfall process is typically too slow to result in an agile innovation lifecycle."
    - content: Build, measure, learn
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "This iterative process is the basic framework to run progressive innovations."
    - content: Crawl, walk, run
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Although progressively increasing functionality and complexity is typically a good idea, it isn't necessarily related to the innovation process."

  - content: "Why are microservices architectures often associated with innovation?"
    choices:
    - content: "Because microservices architectures are more secure than monolithic software."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Security isn't the main differentiator between microservices and monolithic architectures. It's the way in which different application modules interact with each other."
    - content: "Because they're based in Kubernetes"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Although microservices architectures are often based in containerized software, it isn't a requirement."
    - content: "Because they enable introducing new functionality in one microservice without affecting the rest"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "The ability to innovate on one microservice without having to touch the rest means that new functionality can be implemented quickly."

  - content: "Why is adopting a DevOps culture critical to enable effective innovation?"
    choices:
    - content: "Because it enables testing in production"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Actually, DevOps means the opposite: Testing should occur as early in the development process as possible, to make software rollouts a safer practice."
    - content: "Because it uses GitHub"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Although GitHub is a great tool to support your DevOps process, it's not the most important criterion in adopting a DevOps culture in an organization."
    - content: "Because it enables bringing new functionality to applications both quickly and reliably."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Deploying new features quickly and reliably allows you to validate or reject innovation hypotheses faster and more efficiently."

  - content: "Is Kubernetes a requirement to innovate an application?"
    choices:
    - content: "No, but containerization can make the build step faster."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Application containerization isn't essential for innovation. But it can ease testing and validation of new application code. As a consequence, it accelerates the innovation process."
    - content: "Yes, only containerized applications can be innovated."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Although containerization does ease testing and validation of new application code, noncontainerized code can be innovated as well."
    - content: "No, because Kubernetes increases the operational complexity for an application."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Although it's true that Kubernetes introduces some operational complexity, containerization accelerates the process of application development."

  - content: "Is it possible to build machine learning and AI into an application without data scientists?"
    choices:
    - content: "Yes, with Azure Kubernetes Service."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Azure Kubernetes Service can help in the build process by running any containerized application, including machine learning and AI. However, it's not essential to enrich an application with AI."
    - content: "Yes, with prebuilt models such as Azure Cognitive Services."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Azure Cognitive Services has prebuilt APIs ready to be embedded into any application without requiring data science skills."
    - content: "No, a data science department is always required."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "It's true that data scientists can build powerful models adapted to each organization's needs. However, there are other options if no data science expertise is available."

  - content: "Which Azure service allows the extraction of telemetry information from user activity to validate or reject innovation hypotheses?"
    choices:
    - content: "Azure DevOps"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Azure DevOps is a great tool to support your DevOps process, but it doesn't include application performance management."
    - content: "Azure App Service"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Azure App Service is a great platform to run web-based applications, but it doesn't include reporting of application telemetry."
    - content: "Azure Application Insights"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Azure Application Insights can track how customers use an application, track how the application performs, and detect anomalies in application performance."

  - content: "Why is data democratization critical for innovation?"
    choices:
    - content: "Because everybody can use spreadsheets"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Although spreadsheets are common for data analysis, they're not great to share and democratize data."
    - content: "Because hypothesis validation should be data driven"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Ideally, all decisions in an organization should be data driven, including the innovation process."
    - content: "Because machine learning is the future"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Although machine learning can uncover hidden data correlations, data-driven decisions don't need support from sophisticated algorithms to be effective."
