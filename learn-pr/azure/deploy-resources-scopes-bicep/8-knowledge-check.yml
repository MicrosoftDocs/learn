      When you submit a deployment for the *main.bicep* file, what will happen?
    choices:
    - content: The deployment will fail with an error.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. The Bicep files are valid.
    - content: A policy definition named `my-policy` will be created at the management group scope.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. Even though the *main.bicep* file has its `targetScope` set to `managementGroup`, the policy definition is defined in a module with its `targetScope` set to `subscription`.
    - content: A policy definition named `my-policy` will be created at the subscription scope.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. The policy definition is defined in a module with its `targetScope` set to `subscription`, so the policy definition will be deployed to the subscription.

      You need to create a role definition that will work throughout your whole organization.
      You decide to deploy it by using a Bicep template.
      Which `targetScope` value should you use for the file?
    choices:
    - content: "`targetScope = 'tenant'`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: |
        Incorrect. Role definitions can't be created at the tenant scope.
        Because you want to use the role definition throughout your whole organization, you could consider deploying it to the root management group instead.
    - content: "`targetScope = 'managementGroup'`"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: |
        Correct. You should deploy the role definition to the root management group, so that it is inherited by all your Azure resources throughout your organization.
        Role definitions can't be created at the tenant scope.
    - content: "`targetScope = 'subscription'`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: |
        Incorrect. Although you can deploy role definitions at a subscription scope, they won't be available to your whole organization.

      Which of these statements is true?
    choices:
    - content: A resource deployed to a management group's scope has a subscription ID in its resource ID.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: |
        Incorrect. Management groups exist at a higher level of the Azure resource hierarchy than a subscription.
        The resource ID includes the management group's ID.
    - content: Management groups must be deployed to the `tenant` scope.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: |
        Correct. Management groups are a tenant-scoped resource.
        You can use Bicep files that have a `targetScope` other than `tenant`, but you need to explicitly set the `scope` to `tenant()`.
    - content: Management groups must be deployed in the scope of a parent management group.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: |
        Incorrect. Management groups are a tenant-scoped resource.
        You can use Bicep files that have a `targetScope` of `managementGroup`, but you need to explicitly set the `scope` to `tenant()`.
        Also, the hierarchy of management groups doesn't depend on how they're deployed.
        You set a management group's parent as one of its properties.
