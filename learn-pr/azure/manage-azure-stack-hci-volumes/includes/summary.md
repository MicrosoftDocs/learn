You’ve learned how Azure Stack HCI storage volumes can help address the resiliency and performance needs of your business-critical workloads by:

- Providing highly redundant volume configurations that allow for optimal balance between resiliency, performance, and disk space usage efficiency.

- Minimizing the management overhead facilitated by Windows Admin Center.

You explored the various considerations for designing, implementing, and managing Azure Stack HCI storage volumes. You also learned how to maintain these volumes to maximize uptime.
