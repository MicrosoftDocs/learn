quiz:
  questions:
  - content: 'What’s the minimum number of cluster nodes required to implement dual parity?'
    choices:
    - content: 'Two'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'Incorrect. It isn’t possible to implement dual parity with just two servers.'
    - content: 'Three'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'Incorrect. It isn’t possible to implement dual parity with only three servers.'
    - content: 'Four'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: 'Correct. Implementing dual parity requires at least four servers.'
  - content: 'What’s the minimum number of cluster nodes required to implement mirror-accelerated parity?'
    choices:
    - content: 'Two'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'Incorrect. It isn’t possible to implement mirror-accelerated parity with just two servers.'
    - content: 'Three'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'Incorrect. It isn’t possible to implement mirror-accelerated parity with only three servers.'
    - content: 'Four'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: 'Correct. Implementing mirror-accelerated parity requires at least four servers.'
  - content: 'What’s the number of nodes required to implement nested resiliency?'
    choices:
    - content: 'Two'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: 'Correct. Nested resiliency is available exclusively on 2-node clusters.'
    - content: 'Three'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'Incorrect. Nested resiliency isn’t available on 3-node clusters.'
    - content: 'Four'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'Incorrect. Nested resiliency isn’t available on 4-node clusters.'
  - content: 'Which functionality requires the use of ReFS only?'
    choices:
    - content: 'Mirror-accelerated parity'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: 'Correct. Mirror-accelerated parity requires the use of ReFS.'
    - content: 'ACL'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'Incorrect. ReFS and NTFS both support ACL.'
    - content: 'Volume-level snapshots'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'Incorrect. ReFS and NTFS both support volume-level snapshots.'
  - content: 'What’s the minimum number of nodes required to implement a stretched cluster?'
    choices:
    - content: 'Two'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'Incorrect. A stretched cluster cannot be implemented with only two nodes.'
    - content: 'Three'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'Incorrect. A stretched cluster cannot be implemented with only three nodes.'
    - content: 'Four'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: 'Correct. A stretched cluster can be implemented with four nodes.'
