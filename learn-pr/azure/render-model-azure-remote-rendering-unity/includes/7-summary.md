The automotive engineering team needed a solution for rendering a 3D model of a truck engine at full detail on an untethered device. You created an Azure Remote Rendering account and then configured a remote rendering object in Unity. After completing those steps, you were able to use Remote Rendering to load and render the truck engine model at full detail. If you have a HoloLens 2 device, you can build the Unity project and deploy to view the model in your real-world environment.
