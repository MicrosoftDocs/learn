Your role as a mixed reality engineer for a truck manufacturer is to create solutions that support manufacturing logistics. Your company is currently designing a new engine to replace their current production model, and has created a 3D virtual model of the new engine. This model enables the automotive engineering team to view and refine the engine design specifications.

However, viewing the model on a computer screen doesn't allow a full-scale detailed 3D view of the engine and its internal mechanics. Being able to use mixed reality and virtual reality devices like HoloLens 2 would help complete a design review of the engine.

In this module, you learn how to use Azure Remote Rendering to render the 3D model. create a remote rendering session, load a 3D model into the session, and render the model. You create an Remote Rendering account and session, load the 3D engine model in Unity, and connect your local Unity runtime to the remote session. You can then view and interact with the model untethered at full scale and detail.

## Learning objectives

- Learn about Remote Rendering and managing sessions.
- Create a Remote Rendering account.
- Load a project and 3D model in Unity.
- Use Remote Rendering to render the 3D model.

## Prerequisites

- Windows 10 version 1903 or higher, or Windows 11. Windows 32-bit versions aren't supported.
- Windows 10 SDK 10.0.18362.0 or later, or Windows 11 SDK.
- Unity 2019.4.X or higher installed, with Unity Hub.
- Visual Studio 2019 or higher with the following workloads installed:
  - .NET desktop development
  - Desktop development with C++
  - Universal Windows Platform (UWP) development with C++ (v142) UWP tools
  - Game development with Unity
- Ideally, some familiarity with C# and Unity scripting and development.
