  questions:
  - content: "What is decimation, and how does it impact the appearance of 3D content on untethered devices?"
    choices:
      - content: "Decimation compresses a model to remove textures, so models don't render with full detail."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Decimation removes polygons, so models don't render with full detail."
      - content: "Decimation compresses a model to remove noise, so models render with improved quality."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Decimation removes polygons, so models render with reduced quality."
      - content: "Decimation compresses a model to remove polygons, so models don't render with full detail."
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "Decimation reduces the quality of a model, because the model doesn't render with full detail."
  - content: "How long does a session ID persist?"
    choices:
      - content: "The session ID persists for 24 hours."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "The session ID persists for longer than 24 hours."
      - content: "The session ID persists for 30 days."
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "The session ID persists for 30 days, so you can query information about a past session."
      - content: "The session ID persists for 12 months."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "The session ID expires in less than 12 months."
  - content: "How many devices can connect to a session at a time?"
    choices:
      - content: "Only one device can connect to a session at a time."
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "An Azure Remote Rendering host only serves one client device at a time. When a client connects to a session, that client has exclusive control over the rendered content."
      - content: "Up to five devices can connect to a session at a time."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Attempts to connect to a session by more than one device fail. Another device can connect only after the session stops."
      - content: "Any number of devices can connect to a session at once."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "You can create, observe, and shut down as many sessions as you want, but only one device can connect to a session at a time."
