  questions:
  - content: "Which key component of Kubernetes does Azure Arc-enabled data services use?"
    choices:
    - content: "Kubernetes API"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. All services use one of the key components of the Kubernetes platform, the Kubernetes API"
    - content: "Azure CLI"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Azure CLI isn't a key component of Kubernetes"
    - content: "kubectl"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. kubectl is a tool used with Kubernetes but isn't a key component used by Azure Arc-enabled data services"
    - content: "Azure Arc Agents"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Azure Arc Agents are deployed on the Kubernetes cluster but not a component of Kubernetes"
  - content: "Which connected mode supports the Azure Resource Manager?"
    choices:
    - content: "indirect connected mode"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Indirect connected mode can't use the Azure Resource Manager. You can't use tools like the Azure portal to deploy or manage Azure Arc-enabled data services"
    - content: "direct connected mode"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. With direct connected mode, users can use the Azure Resource Manager through the Azure CLI and Azure portal"
    - content: "Azure connected mode"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The only connected mode options are direct or connected"
  - content: "The Azure Arc data controller requires a Kubernetes cluster to be connected to Azure"
    choices:
    - content: "true"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. An Azure Arc data controller can be deployed in indirect connected mode, which doesn't require the Kubernetes cluster to be connected to Azure"
    - content: "false"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. An Azure Arc data controller can be deployed in indirect connected mode, which doesn't require the Kubernetes cluster to be connected to Azure"
  - content: "What component coordinates Azure Resource Manager requests to deploy and manage Azure Arc-enabled data services on Kubernetes?"
    choices:
    - content: "Azure Arc data controller"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The Azure Arc data controller coordinates only within in the Kubernetes cluster"
    - content: "Azure portal"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The Azure portal is an interface that uses the Azure Resource Manager"
    - content: "Azure Arc resource providers"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Azure Arc resource providers coordinate this request with Azure Arc agents and the Azure Arc data controller in the Kubernetes cluster to complete the deployment of Kubernetes pods and services"
    - content: "Azure CLI"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The Azure CLI is an interface that uses the Azure Resource Manager"
