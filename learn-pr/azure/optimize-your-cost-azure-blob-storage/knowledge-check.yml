quiz:
  questions:
  - content: 'Which Azure Blob Storage redundancy option helps provide protection against the failure of an individual datacenter at minimum cost?'
    choices:
    - content: 'ZRS'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: 'Correct. Zone-redundant storage provides increased resiliency by replicating the content of a storage account across physical locations (availability zones) in the same Azure region.'
    - content: 'LRS'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'Incorrect. Locally redundant storage synchronously replicates the content of a storage account across three replicas within the same physical location.'
    - content: 'GRS'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'Incorrect. Geo-redundant storage implements region-level resiliency by enabling asynchronous replication of the content of a storage account across two regions. This is more expensive than ZRS.'
  - content: 'What is the minimum period of time after which a blob assigned to the cool tier is no longer subject to the early deletion charge?'
    choices:
    - content: '30 days'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: 'Correct. 30 days is the minimum period of time after which a blob assigned to the cool tier is no longer subject to the early deletion charge.'
    - content: '90 days'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'Incorrect. 30 days is the minimum period of time after which a blob assigned to the cool tier is no longer subject to the early deletion charge.'
    - content: '180 days'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'Incorrect. 30 days is the minimum period of time after which a blob assigned to the cool tier is no longer subject to the early deletion charge.'
  - content: 'What’s the minimum period of time after which a blob assigned to the archive tier is no longer subject to the early deletion charge?'
    choices:
    - content: '30 days'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'Incorrect. 180 days is the minimum period of time after which a blob assigned to the archive tier is no longer subject to the early deletion charge.'
    - content: '90 days'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'Incorrect. 180 days is the minimum period of time after which a blob assigned to the archive tier is no longer subject to the early deletion charge.'
    - content: '180 days'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: 'Correct. 180 days is the minimum period of time after which a blob assigned to the archive tier is no longer subject to the early deletion charge.'
  - content: 'What’s the expected amount of time to rehydrate a blob assigned to the archive tier without raising a high priority request?'
    choices:
    - content: '1 hour'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'Incorrect. The expected amount of time to rehydrate a blob assigned to the archive tier without raising a high priority request isn’t 1 hour. However, 1 hour is expected with a high priority request.'
    - content: '5 hours'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'Incorrect. The expected amount of time to rehydrate a blob assigned to the archive tier without raising a high priority request isn’t 5 hours.'
    - content: '15 hours'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: 'Correct. The expected amount of time to rehydrate a blob assigned to the archive tier without raising a high priority request is 15 hours. 1 hour is expected with a high priority request.'
  - content: 'What’s the minimum size of a block in which Azure Blob Storage reservations can be purchased?'
    choices:
    - content: '1 TB'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'Incorrect. The minimum size of a block in which Azure Blob Storage reservations can be purchased isn’t 1 TB.'
    - content: '100 TB'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: 'Correct. The minimum size of a block in which Azure Blob Storage reservations can be purchased is 100 TB.'
    - content: '1 PB'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'Incorrect. The minimum size of a block in which Azure Blob Storage reservations can be purchased isn’t 1 PB, although this size is available as well.'
