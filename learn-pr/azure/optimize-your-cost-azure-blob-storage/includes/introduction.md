Azure Blob Storage offers a range of features that help minimize the cost of storing and using unstructured data.

### Example scenario

Suppose you work for a media company that has several departments, each generating large amounts of data in diverse formats. For the majority of the data, you rely on Azure Blob Storage as the persistent, readily accessible data store. The main business units have an extensive library of video clips, which users access multiple times a day. The web-services team operates dozens of web servers that generate huge amounts of server log data. They use these log files to troubleshoot customer issues and perform short‑term analytics and reporting. The database administration team relies on Azure Blob Storage as a long-term destination for backups of on-premises data stores. As a result of regulatory requirements, these backups need to be preserved for several years even though there’s rarely a need to restore them.

As an Azure administrator who’s responsible for tracking the costs of Azure resources, you’re noticing a steady increase in storage-related charges. You suspect that some teams' storage-use patterns aren’t set up to utilize the cost optimization features of Azure Blob Storage. In your search for options to help lower your company’s Azure consumption costs, you decide to explore these optimization features. Your intention is to review the Azure Blob Storage pricing model, identify data use cases with the largest pricing impact, and determine which cost‑management features might help you lower your storage costs.

### What will we be doing?

In this module, you'll explore the Azure Blob Storage features that can help minimize object storage costs. You'll also review a sample implementation and the use of these features.

### What is the main goal?

By the end of this module, you'll be able to describe the Azure Blob Storage features that can help your organization minimize its object storage costs. You'll also have a better understanding of how to design, implement, and manage these features.
