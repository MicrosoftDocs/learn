Rich documentation for an API makes it more consumable and easier to maintain. In this module's example, you used Swashbuckle and Swagger to autogenerate OpenAPI documentation for your ASP.NET Core API. 

Adding Swashbuckle packages to your project provides you professional OpenAPI documentation. Swagger UI makes the OpenAPI documentation easy to read and doesn't require the consumer to know the source code of the API.

You then learned how to enhance the default documentation through XML comments and annotations.
