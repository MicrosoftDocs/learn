Your company has a large number of files that are used across the company. Local storage is nearing capacity, and buying more storage to support file shares isn't an economical option. Your offices are located in different geographical regions and they all need the latest versions of documents.

You can configure Azure Files to provide a central location for your file shares in the cloud. You can also configure Azure File Sync to keep the information up to date across multiple offices and transform local Windows servers into quick caches of frequently accessed files.

### Prerequisites

- Familiarity with creating an Azure subscription and storage account
- Basic understanding of file shares

### Learning Objectives

After completing this module, you'll be able to:

- Identify use cases for Azure Files with and without Azure File Sync.
- Understand the different types and tiers of Azure file shares and when to use them.
- Choose a redundancy option for your Azure file shares.
- Understand the options for user access control and identity-based authentication.
