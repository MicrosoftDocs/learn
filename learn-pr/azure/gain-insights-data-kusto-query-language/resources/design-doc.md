Familiarity with database structures like tables, columns, and rows
Familiarity with Kusto Query Language operators such as count, take, project, where, and sort.

## Summary

Write advanced queries in Kusto Query Language to help you gain insights from your data. Learn how to use the aggregation operators `count`, `dcount`, `countif`, `sum`, `min`,`max`, `avg`, `percentiles`, and others. Communicate these results visually in charts. 

## Learning objectives

1. Use the Kusto Query Language to gain insights from your data by using the aggregation operators  `count`, `dcount`, `countif`, `sum`, `min`,`max`, `avg`, `percentiles`, and others.
1. Communicate query results visually using the `render` operator.
1. Assign variables by using a `let` statement.

## Chunk your content into subtasks

Identify the subtasks of module title.

| Subtask | What part of the introduction scenario does this subtask satisfy? | How will you assess it: Exercise or Knowledge check? | Which learning objective(s) does this help meet? | Does the subtask have enough learning content to justify an entire unit? If not, which other subtask will you combine it with? |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Group data by using aggregate functions | Introduce concepts | Knowledge check | 1 | yes |
| Exercise: Count different types of events using the `count`, `dcount`, and `countif` operators | basic questions | Exercise| 1 | yes |
| Exercise: Visualize data across time using the `bin`, `render`, and `sum` operators | compare| Exercise | 2 | yes |
| Exercise: Summarize data using the `min`,`max`, `avg`, and `percentiles` operators | compare| Exercise | 1 | yes |
| Exercise: Introduce variables using the `let` operator | compare | Exercise |3 | yes |
