In the MEAN stack, the **E** represents the Express component. Express is a web server framework that's built for Node.js. It will handle our request routing and helper system. It's designed to simplify building web applications that are hosted on the Node.js runtime. While the core of Express is routing, it also helps web applications work with HTTP cookies and request query string data.

## Express version

Because Express is a Node.js web application framework, we need to have Node.js and the node package manager installed.

At the time of this writing, the Express version is `4.16.0`.

## How to install Express

The installation is as simple as running the following command:

   ```bash
   npm install express
   ```

You don't need to do this on your VM yet, we'll get to it shortly.

## Summary

With Express installed, we have a shortcut path to responding to HTTP requests. We can quickly set up request routing and handlers for handling API and web page response data.
