Our goal was to help you evaluate whether Microsoft Purview is the right choice to help you manage your enterprise data environment and its various data sources. We looked at how to:

* Register data sources.
* Map data sources.
* Scan data in your sources.
* Explore metadata and classification of the data.

We covered how you can use the Microsoft Purview governance portal to register data sources and create a data map. Setting up scanning causes Microsoft Purview to scan through the selected data types in the sources and list metadata associated with those sources. This metadata documents the expected usage to help users discover what's contained in the data sources. We also showed how the metadata includes classification information to help identify sensitive data.

These criteria help you evaluate how Microsoft Purview can help your business catalog data for users and data producers. We also showed how Microsoft Purview can help your company meet its data governance needs by using the metadata and classification features.
