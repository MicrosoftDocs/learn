In this module, you've learned to develop and design an application in a short period with no bit of coding where users with any level of knowledge can use the apps for business purpose.

As it uses extensive number of clouds and on-premise application including Dynamic 365, you can access the work across the web and the mobile without the time and expense of custom software development.

## Next steps

The application you built in this module is an amateur application that can be further added to, including a few more functions or features provided by **Microsoft Power Apps**. Consider trying the following features:

* Try using different **Connectors**
* Consider including the feature of ordering more than one product.
* Incorporate **View shape in MR** in your present developed application.
