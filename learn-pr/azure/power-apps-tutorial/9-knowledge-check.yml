  questions:
    - content: "What can we measure using the measure in MR component?"
      choices:
        - content: "Distance"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. The amount of space between to two points.
        - content: "Volume"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. The amount of space enclosed in a three-dimensional space.
        - content: "Area"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. The amount of space enclosed in a two-dimensional space.
        - content: "All of the preceding"
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: Correct. Measure in MR measures distance, volume, and area.
    - content: "In the following options, which one best defines Object Scaling?"
      choices:
        - content: "Object scaling allows users to change the size of the models according to their needs using parameters like Object width, Object height, and Object depth."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: Correct. Alternatively, you can specify some or all of the dimensions. These dimensions are labeled as the Object width, Object height, and Object depth properties.
        - content: "Object scaling allows users to visualize 3D objects in their real world."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. View in MR allows users to visualize the 3D object in their real world.
        - content: "Object scaling helps in adjusting the screen resolution to the required standards."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. Power Apps can automatically adjust the screen ratio.
    - content: "Which measurement type allows users to measure distance, area, and volume at once?"
      choices:
        - content: "Distance"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. Measures space between two points.
        - content: "Freeform"
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: Correct. Freeform allows users to measure distance, area, and volume at once.
        - content: "Volume"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. The amount of space enclosed in a three-dimensional space.
    - content: "Which is the best suited 3D content format to be included in Power Apps?"
      choices:
        - content: ".obj"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. The OBJ file format is a simple data-format that represents 3D geometry alone
        - content: ".stl"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. STL is a file format native to the stereolithography CAD software created by 3D Systems.
        - content: ".glb"
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: Correct. GLB is a 3D file format that's used in virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), games, and web applications because it supports motion.
    - content: "View in 3D allows users to ____________"
      choices:
        - content: "Visualize 3D objects in the real-world environment"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. View in MR allows users to visualize 3D objects in the real-world environment.
        - content: "Measure objects in real-world"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. Measure in MR allows users to measure objects in real-world.
        - content: "Rotate and zoom into the model with simple gestures."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: Correct. View in MR allows users to rotate and zoom into the model with simple gestures.
