      explanation: "Review the change data capture (CDC) section."
    - content: "Two days"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Review the change data capture (CDC) section."
    - content: "Three days"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! The CDC cleanup process is responsible for enforcing the retention-based cleanup policy. By default, three days of data are retained."
  - content: "Which is the default function that CDC provides for querying all the changes on table within the specified log sequence number (LSN) range?"
    choices:
    - content: "cdc.fn_cdc_get_all_changes_<capture_instance>"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! The function cdc.fn_cdc_get_all_changes_<capture_instance> is used to query for all changes on table within the specified LSN range."
    - content: "cdc.fn_cdc_get_net_changes_<capture_instance>"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "If the capture instance is configured to support net changes, the enumeration function `cdc.fn_cdc_get_net_changes_<capture_instance>` also gets created which returns one net change row for each source row changed within the specified LSN range."
  - content: "Which tool should I use if I want to identify whether an insert / update / delete was executed on my data, but without needing a historical record of my data changes?"
    choices:
    - content: "Change data capture (CDC)"

      explanation: "CDC tracks insert, update, and delete activity that applies to a table and also records historical data changes."
    - content: "SQL Data Sync"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "SQL Data Sync is a soon-to-be retired tool and shouldn't be considered for future application development."
