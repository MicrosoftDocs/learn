quiz:
  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "Which data import method is best for importing daily traffic-camera video data when you have moderate to high network bandwidth?"
    choices:
    - content: "Data Box Gateway"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Data Box Gateway is ideally suited to continuous ingestion scenarios."
    - content: "Azure Stack Edge"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Azure Stack Edge enables preprocessing of data, which isn't needed in this case."
    - content: "Data Box Disk"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Data Box Disk enables regular imports, but not continuous ingestion."
  - content: "What's the maximum amount of data that can be transferred to Azure in one operation through the Azure Data Box Disk?"
    choices:
    - content: "35 TB"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "35 TB is the maximum amount of transferable data for a single Data Box Disk order."
    - content: "500 TB"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Data Box Disk Heavy allows for up to 800 TB of data transfer and would be a candidate for this scenario."
    - content: "80 TB"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This transfer isn't possible with a single Data Box Disk order."
  - content: "You have a huge amount of data generated by smart devices and applications at your data center. You want to perform rapid machine learning-based inference on the data before moving it to Azure for deeper analysis. Which device would you use?"
    choices:
    - content: "Azure Stack Edge device"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Azure Stack Edge devices are online physical appliances that provide data preprocessing and machine learning before transfer to the cloud."
    - content: "Data Box Gateway"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Data Box Gateway is an online virtual appliance that doesn't provide data preprocessing and machine learning."
    - content: "Data Box Heavy"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Data Box Heavy allows for up to 800 TB of data transfer, but it doesn't provide data preprocessing and machine learning."
