In this module, you learned how to fine-tune and calibrate the devices connected to your sensor, to triage the alerts listed in Defender for IoT and to change from *learning* to *operational* mode. In particular, you learned how to:

- Fine-tune and calibrate alerts in Defender for IoT on the Azure portal.
- View and modify subnet data listed in Defender for IoT.
- Update device information and merge devices.
- Check public IP addresses and assign the IP addresses for DHCP ranges.
- Triage alerts to create an alert baseline.
- Analyze the alert details.
- Follow the Take Action instructions and to update the alert status and severity levels.
- Create a suppression rule.
