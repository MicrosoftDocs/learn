Azure Batch is a powerful service for running large-scale parallel and high-performance computing batch jobs efficiently in Azure. The Batch service handles all the management and scheduling, including monitoring and other services.

You've seen in this module how convenient it's to use the Azure portal to create all the resources and components of the Azure Batch workflow. At the same time, options are available to implement and manage the Batch service without writing any code. The Azure portal helps you create batch accounts, pools, jobs, and tasks, and then monitor their status, progress, and outputs.
