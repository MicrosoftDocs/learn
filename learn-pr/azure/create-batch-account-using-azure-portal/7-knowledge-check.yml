quiz:
  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:

  - content: "What are jobs executed on?"
    choices:
    - content: "Storage accounts"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Storage accounts can be used for saving job and task output, but they're not what jobs are executed on."
    - content: "Virtual networks"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Virtual networks can be used to securely communicate between Azure resources, but they're not what jobs are executed on."
    - content: "Pools of compute nodes"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Batch distributes the tasks that make up jobs across pools of compute nodes. Pools are simply a collection of virtual machines."

  - content: "When you create a Batch account, what are the options available to avoid public access?"
    choices:
    - content: "Batch account with Batch service pool allocation"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Changing the pool allocation mode for your Batch account does not inherently improve its security."
    - content: "Batch account with public network access disabled"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Batch accounts with public network access disabled can be used with private endpoints to disable public network access."
    - content: "Batch account with user subscription pool allocation"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Changing the pool allocation mode for your Batch account does not inherently improve its security."

  - content: "Which of the following features enhances security for data on individual compute nodes?"
    choices:
    - content: "Disk encryption"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Disk encryption safeguards data on a compute node's disk."
    - content: "No public IP pools"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Although the feature of no public IP pools enhances the security of your Batch solution, it does not affect data on individual compute nodes."
    - content: "Azure Storage"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Azure Storage can be used as a place for storing input or output data, but it's a separate Azure service. It isn't directly tied to data on a compute node's disk."
