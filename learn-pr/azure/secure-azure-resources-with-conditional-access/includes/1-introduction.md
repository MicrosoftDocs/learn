Azure Multi-Factor Authentication has traditionally been deployed like a hammer by IT departments, enabled for every user for every authentication. When the feature is integrated with conditional access, Azure Multi-Factor Authentication becomes a razor-sharp scalpel that allows you to specify which apps and circumstances require it.

Imagine that you work for First Up Consultants, an engineering firm that specializes in circuit and electrical design. They're moving their on-premises workloads to Azure. Your manager in the IT department is responsible for keeping the company’s assets secure. The admin wants you to make sure that any time an administrator accesses the Azure portal, they've performed multi-factor authentication. The admin has tasked you with enabling this functionality and testing it. You'll use Azure AD, conditional access, and Azure Multi-Factor Authentication.

In this module, you will learn how to use conditional access along with Azure Multi-Factor Authentication to secure access to the Azure portal.
