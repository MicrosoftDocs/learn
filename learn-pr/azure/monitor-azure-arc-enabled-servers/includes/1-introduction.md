Azure Arc promises to bridge the gap between on-premises and cloud environments. Azure Arc provides a consistent operational approach with the agility, automation, and scalability of the Azure platform and its services. In this module, you'll learn about Azure Arc-enabled servers’ monitoring capabilities.

Suppose you’re responsible for monitoring the infrastructure performance at Tailwind Manufacturing, a small industrial firm. As your company invests in its hybrid and multicloud environment, it has onboarded its non-Azure machines, across its industrial floor and business offices, to Azure Arc-enabled servers. One challenge is observability across your sprawling IT infrastructure. You want both smart and scalable alerting and a range of metrics, logs, and visualizations. 

Through Azure Arc-enabled servers, you can use Azure’s robust monitoring plane through Log Analytics, VM insights, and Azure Dashboards to deliver enhanced observability across your hybrid environment. The same visibility you have into Azure resources, you can extend to your resources sitting outside of Azure.
