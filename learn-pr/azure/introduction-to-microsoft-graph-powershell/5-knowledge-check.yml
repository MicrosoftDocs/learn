### General guidance (https://review.learn.microsoft.com/learn-docs/docs/id-guidance-knowledge-check)
###  - Questions are complete sentences ending with a question mark
###  - No true/false questions
###  - 3 answers per question
###  - All answers about the same length
###  - Numeric answers listed in sorted order
###  - No "All of the above" and/or "None of the above" as answer choices
###  - No "Not" or "Except" in questions
###  - No second person ("you") in the questions or answers
###  - Provide a meaningful explanation for both correct and incorrect answers
###
### Question content requirements:
###  - Write 5 questions
###  - Questions 1,2 must test this Learning Objective: "Describe how (attributes) of (product) work to (solve problem)"
###      Guidance: These two questions can be short, no need for a long scenario to analyze. Test if they understand how the product works.
###      Example: "What differentiates an action from a control action in a Logic App?"
###  - Questions 3,4,5 must test this Learning Objective: "Evaluate whether (product) is appropriate to (general product use case)"
###      Guidance: Use scenario questions that ask the learner to analyze a situation with the "when to use" criteria presented in the module.
###      Example: "A financial company is building a system to let brokers trade financial instruments. The system must monitor market conditions, detect changes, and execute trades. It will need to handle a large volume of transactions quickly. The faster it completes trades, the more of an advantage the company will have over its competitors. Which requirement of this system would be difficult for Azure Logic Apps to satisfy?"

quiz:
  questions:
  - content: "An IT admin has recently installed Microsoft Graph PowerShell to administer various tasks in Azure AD. They're new to this module and would like to find cmdlets for different resources in the directory. What would be the **BEST** place for them to start?"
    choices:
    - content: "Run `Connect-MgGraph` to connect to the Azure AD directory and run cmdlets based on `Verb-MgResource` format."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Connect-MgGraph helps you sign in to your directory requesting the appropriate permissions."
    - content: "Run `Find-MgGraphCommand` to discover cmdlets associated with the resource name, for example, user."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Find-MgGraphCommand helps you find cmdlets when you pass a resource name. It will also help you discover permissions required for the cmdlets."
    - content: "Run `Find-MgGraphPermission` to discover the cmdlets associated with the particular domain."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Find-MgGraphPermission helps find permissions and not cmdlets applicable to a certain domain, for example, user."
  - content: "An IT admin has been tasked with automating a reporting process across a set of Microsoft services. Each of these services has an API in Microsoft Graph. Which feature of Microsoft Graph PowerShell makes it a good tool to use to automate this process?"
    choices:
    - content: "Microsoft Graph PowerShell acts as an API wrapper for all Microsoft Graph APIs, exposing the entire API set for use in PowerShell."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Every service that has an API in Microsoft Graph has a cmdlet in Microsoft Graph PowerShell. This feature makes it possible to automate a process across a set of services."
    - content: "Microsoft Graph PowerShell supports rich, advanced queries via eventual consistency hence support for complex functions."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "It's true that Microsoft Graph PowerShell supports advanced queries, but that doesn't make it possible to automate a process across a set of Microsoft services."
    - content: "Microsoft Graph PowerShell is easy to learn and use and would be easy to connect several Microsoft services using the SDK."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Easy to learn and use isn't stated as feature of Microsoft Graph PowerShell and doesn't make it possible to automate a process across a set of Microsoft services."
  - content: "What makes Microsoft Graph PowerShell a cross-platform (Windows, Linux, and macOS) automation tool?"
    choices:
    - content: "Microsoft Graph PowerShell uses Microsoft Authentication Library that supports modern authentication."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Microsoft Graph PowerShell supports modern authentication through Microsoft Authentication Library, but this feature doesn't make it a cross-platform tool."
    - content: "Microsoft Graph PowerShell provides commands for the entire Microsoft Graph API."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Microsoft Graph PowerShell is PowerShell for the entire set of Microsoft Graph APIs, but this feature doesn't make it a cross-platform tool."
    - content: "Microsoft Graph PowerShell supports PowerShell 7, which is itself a cross-platform tool."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "PowerShell 7 is a cross-platform automation tool that is supported by Microsoft Graph PowerShell. This relation makes Microsoft Graph PowerShell a cross platform tool."
