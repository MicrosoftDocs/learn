Microsoft Graph PowerShell wouldn't exist without Microsoft Graph. Microsoft Graph is a gateway to data and intelligence in Microsoft 365. It offers a single endpoint, https://graph.microsoft.com, to access rich, people-centric data and insights in the Microsoft cloud, including Microsoft 365, Windows, and Enterprise Mobility + Security through REST APIs.
  
Microsoft Graph PowerShell is an SDK that acts as an API wrapper for the Microsoft Graph APIs, exposing the entire API set for use in PowerShell. It contains cmdlets for all the Microsoft Graph APIs. Microsoft Graph PowerShell cmdlets and the reference documentation are autogenerated from the Microsoft Graph REST APIs.

## Packaging

Microsoft Graph PowerShell is packaged as the **Microsoft.Graph** module in PowerShell gallery as the root module with multiple child modules. **Microsoft.Graph** acts as a container for the other modules.

Microsoft.Graph.Authentication is the core module, which contains the following components:

- Connect-MgGraph: to sign in to Microsoft Graph
- Invoke-MgGraphRequest: to issue REST API requests for the Microsoft Graph API
- Commands to switch between **beta** and **V1.0** versions of the SDK and access sovereign cloud Graph APIs
- Commands to discover permissions and API-specific Graph commands in other modules

The other modules are made up of thousands of commands.

Commands are named like **{Verb}**-Mg **{Resource}** (a Graph API resource) for example, user,group, and application. For example, in the command `Get-MgUser`, **get** is the verb and **user** the resource.
