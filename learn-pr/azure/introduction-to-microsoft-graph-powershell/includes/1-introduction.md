Implementing business process automation across a set of Microsoft 365 services can be challenging if the right tool isn't available. Think about all the repetitive bulk administrative tasks your company needs to do: user/group lifecycle management, App management, Exchange and Sharepoint. How do you automate tasks across all these services? Microsoft Graph PowerShell exposes the entire Microsoft Graph API set for use in PowerShell providing a powerful way to optimize your work flow.

## Example scenario

Suppose you're the IT admin of a vendor company that develops software solutions. Your organization is using Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) and other Microsoft 365 services. You maintain a database of the company employees as users registered in Azure AD. As your company grows, you would like to ease the process of onboarding new employees and removing access from previous employees. You would also like, from time to time, to update user info, reset their passwords, and manage access to resources by assigning roles to users. You've been tasked with finding the best tool to help you manage this process. With your knowledge of PowerShell, you would like to learn if Microsoft Graph PowerShell would be the most appropriate tool to automate this process.

## What will we be doing?

Microsoft Graph PowerShell is PowerShell for the entire Microsoft Graph Application Programming Interface (API) and provides PowerShell commands for all REST APIs in Microsoft Graph. We'll look at the features and benefits of the Microsoft Graph PowerShell module and how to use the module to automate different business processes.

We’ll analyze different aspects of Microsoft Graph PowerShell to help you learn how and when to use them:

- What you need to  install the Microsoft Graph PowerShell module
