  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: Your organization has Linux virtual machines on Azure, and you want to enable Azure Disk Encryption to ensure that all of the OS disks are secured. What must you do to achieve this?
    choices:
    - content: Ensure the Azure Key Vault and the virtual machines are in the same region, create a backup, enable disk encryption, then sign in to the machine to monitor it while encryption takes place.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Don't use a Linux machine while this encryption is taking place.
    - content: Ensure the Azure Key Vault and the virtual machines are in the same region, create a back-up, enable disk encryption, and avoid using the machines while encryption takes place.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Creating a backup or snapshot ensures your machines are safe if something goes wrong during encryption. Because we're dealing with Linux, it's a good idea to avoid using the machines while encryption takes place.
    - content: Ensure the virtual machines are in the same region, create a backup, enable disk encryption, and avoid using the machines while encryption is happening.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: You haven't ensured that the virtual machines are in the same region as the Key Vault that will be used. For encryption to succeed with ADE, the Key Vault must be created and in the same region.
  - content: Your organization uses client-side encryption before storing data into Azure. What must be created first to encrypt data before it's sent to Azure?
    choices:
    - content: Create a disk encryption key.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Disk encryption keys aren't used with client-side encryption using the storage client library.
    - content: Create a key connection encryption key.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: There's no such thing as a key connection encryption key in client-side encryption with Azure.
    - content: Create a content encryption key.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: A content encryption key is first created and encrypted with a key encryption key.
  - content: Your organization has data stored in hard drives. It wants to move this data into a secure Azure storage solution. The encryption process should require minimal effort. What solution would allow you to secure this data with the most minimal effort?
    choices:
    - content: Azure Disk Encryption.
      isCorrect:  false
      explanation:  ADE would require a process to encrypt disks that are on Azure. Compared with SSE, where encryption is done automatically and by default, ADE is more complex. This process is for encrypting disks only – not other types of storage.
    - content: Azure Storage Service Encryption.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: SSE allows encryption on all data stored on storage accounts. Encryption is automatically enabled by default.
    - content: Client-side encryption with Azure.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Client-side encryption would involve a process where you're expected to encrypt and decrypt all of the data yourself using multiple encryption keys.
