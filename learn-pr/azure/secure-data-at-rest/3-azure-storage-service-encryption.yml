quiz:
  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: Your organization has Linux virtual machines on Azure. How can you enable Azure Disk Encryption to help secure all of the OS disks?
    choices:
    - content: Ensure that the key vault and the virtual machines are in the same region. Create a backup, enable disk encryption, and then sign in to the machine to monitor it during encryption.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Don't use a Linux machine while this encryption is happening.
    - content: Ensure that the key vault and the virtual machines are in the same region. Create a backup, enable disk encryption, and avoid using the machines during encryption.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Creating a backup or snapshot helps ensure that your machines are safe if something goes wrong during encryption. Because we're dealing with Linux, it's a good idea to avoid using the machines while encryption is happening.
    - content: Ensure that the virtual machines are in the same region. Create a backup, enable disk encryption, and avoid using the machines during encryption.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: For encryption to succeed with Azure Disk Encryption, you must create a key vault and put it in the same region as the virtual machines.
  - content: Your organization uses client-side encryption before storing data in Azure. What must you create first to encrypt data before it's sent to Azure?
    choices:
    - content: Create a disk encryption key.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Disk encryption keys aren't used with client-side encryption through the storage client library.
    - content: Create a key connection encryption key.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: There's no such thing as a key connection encryption key in client-side encryption with Azure.
    - content: Create a content encryption key.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: A content encryption key is first created and then encrypted with a key encryption key.
  - content: Your organization has data stored in hard drives. It wants to move this data into a secure Azure storage solution. What solution would allow you to encrypt this data with minimal effort?
    choices:
    - content: Azure Disk Encryption.
      isCorrect:  false
      explanation:  Azure Disk Encryption would require a process to encrypt disks that are on Azure. Compared with Storage Service Encryption, where encryption happens automatically and by default, Azure Disk Encryption is more complex. This process is for encrypting disks only, not other types of storage.
    - content: Azure Storage Service Encryption.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Storage Service Encryption allows encryption on all data stored on storage accounts. Encryption is enabled by default.
    - content: Client-side encryption with Azure.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Client-side encryption would require you to encrypt and decrypt all of the data yourself by using multiple encryption keys.
