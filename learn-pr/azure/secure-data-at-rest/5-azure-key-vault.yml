  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: Which Azure services can be used together to help your organization store secrets and draw insights on how and when these secrets are accessed over time?
    choices:
      - content: Azure Key Vault with Azure Disk Encryption.
        isCorrect: false
        explanation:  You use Azure Disk Encryption to encrypt OS and data disks for your virtual machines in Azure. You can't use it to audit who has accessed secrets over time.
      - content: Azure Key Vault with Azure Monitor.
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: You can use Azure Key Vault with Azure Monitor and draw insights from AuditEvent logs. 
      - content: Azure Key Vault with client-side encryption.
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: You can't use client-side encryption to audit who has accessed secrets over time. You use client-side encryption to encrypt data through a client application before it's stored in Azure. 
  - content: You need to add a password to a key vault that holds a few other passwords. What command should you use?
    choices:
      - content: Use the "az keyvault create" command.
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: You use this command to create a key vault if one doesn't exist, not to add a secret to one that already exists.
      - content: Use the "az keyvault password set" command.
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: An "az key vault password set" command doesn't exist. 
      - content: Use the "az keyvault secret set" command.
        isCorrect: true
