  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: You've created a new SQL database. How can you enable encryption at rest for that database?
    choices: 
    - content: Go to the portal, find transparent data encryption for Azure SQL Database, and turn it on.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Although this setting would help you enable transparent data encryption, it isn't necessary because you're dealing with a newly created SQL database. Only older SQL databases require you to enable transparent data encryption.
    - content: Use PowerShell to work with the SQL database, and use it to enable transparent data encryption.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Although PowerShell could help you enable transparent data encryption, it isn't necessary because you're dealing with a newly created SQL database. Only older SQL databases require you to enable transparent data encryption.
    - content: The SQL database already has encryption enabled. There's nothing to be done.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Newly created SQL databases automatically have transparent data encryption enabled.
  - content: Keys are used to encrypt your Azure Cosmos DB data. What must you do with these keys to protect the data?
    choices:
    - content: You must copy these keys. You can then reuse the keys to help protect the data.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: You don't access the keys yourself. Azure manages the keys for you. 
    - content: You don't have to do anything. The keys are rotated automatically.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Azure Cosmos DB automatically rotates the keys in the background to help protect your data.
    - content: You must rotate the keys. The keys need to be changed periodically to help protect the data. 
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: You don't have to do anything. The keys are rotated automatically.
