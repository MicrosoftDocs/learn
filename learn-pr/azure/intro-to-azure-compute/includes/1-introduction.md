Imagine that you've landed your dream job as a developer at a new space technology firm. On your first day, you're assigned to help researchers analyze a large dataset being generated for a cutting-edge research project to explore water on Mars &mdash; and time is of the essence. But there's a problem; you don't have any free servers to do the work. And even if they did appear, you'd need to invest a lot of time to set them up and install software.

Of course you could ask to buy new equipment, but your department's budget is tight. Plus, you don't want to buy more hardware than needed, not only because you want to make a good impression with leadership, but also because you just don't know how much data will be generated by this project.

Ideally, you'd obtain the resources you need to do the work without too much administration &mdash; and simply configure them to do the work. And you'd pay only for the compute resources you need while you're using them.

This is exactly what we can do in Azure. We can create compute resources, configure them to do the work we need, and pay only for what we use.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you will:

- Identify compute options in Azure
- Select compute options that are appropriate for your business
