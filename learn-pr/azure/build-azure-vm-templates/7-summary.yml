  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "Say you want to create a reusable template that uses the Custom Script Extension to configure web content on a VM. What's the best way to enable deployments to specify the script that configures web content?"
    choices:
    - content: "Provide a parameter that specifies the script location."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Parameters promote reuse. Their values are filled in when the template runs."
    - content: "Provide a variable that specifies the script location."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Although variables can help make your templates easier to maintain, they're not the best choice when making your templates configurable or reusable."
    - content: "Provide a default script location in your template and then use a nested template to override that location."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Although you can use a nested template to override default values, it may make your deployments more complex than necessary."
