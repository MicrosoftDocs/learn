Some organizations have complex mathematical tasks that require high-performance compute resources. In Azure, you have a choice of several technologies to use for these types of tasks.

Suppose you're an IT architect at a Biotech organization that uses cutting edge molecular biology techniques to create new therapeutics for the world's most challenging diseases. Your team supports different groups of scientist and researchers, each of whom work in a different stage of the drug discovery pipeline. All these groups share an internal High Performance Computing (HPC) cluster to do their computational analysis. The internal HPC cluster is heavily utilized and becoming over-subscribed. You've been tasked with determining which tasks would be a good fit for the HPC services that Microsoft Azure provides.

<!--- Suppose you work for an engineering organization that has an application that creates 3D models of the facilities they design. Your organization also has another system that stores a large amount of project-related statistical data. They want to use Azure to modernize the aging high-performance compute platforms that support these applications. Your organization needs to understand the solutions available on Azure, and how they fit into their plans. --->

In this module, you learn about the Azure technologies that you can use to run intensive computing tasks.

By the end of this module, you're able to choose the correct Azure technology to use for any high-performance computing project.
