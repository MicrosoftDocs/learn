  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "What's the advantage of using Azure Batch, rather than provisioning the required number of VMs for the task at hand?"
    choices:
    - content: "Because Azure Batch is a managed service, you get a discount on the compute capacity you purchase."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "There's no discount on capacity. Azure Batch helps by scheduling and managing nodes for HPC."
    - content: "Azure Batch handles the scheduling and managing of nodes for you, free of charge."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Azure Batch makes it easier to run HPC tasks by scheduling and managing nodes."
    - content: "Only by using Azure Batch can you access the most high-performing VM SKUs on Azure."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "You can create high-performance VMs manually without Azure Batch. Azure Batch helps by scheduling and managing nodes for HPC."
  - content: "You've analyzed a problem and found that it has 1000 separate subtasks. To solve this problem, your manager agrees to budget 20 VM nodes to run in Azure Batch. Compared to running on a single VM node of the same size, approximately how much quicker would you expect the problem's solution to be?"
    choices:
    - content: "1/50 of the time."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Because there are many small subtasks, Azure Batch evenly distributes the work, and 20 VMs can complete the tasks in approximately 1/20 of the time."
    - content: "1/20 of the time."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Because there are many small subtasks, Azure Batch evenly distributes the work, and 20 VMs can complete the tasks in approximately 1/20 of the time."
    - content: "The same length of time, but results are more accurate."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Because there are many small subtasks, Azure Batch evenly distributes the work, and 20 VMs can complete the tasks in approximately 1/20 of the time."
