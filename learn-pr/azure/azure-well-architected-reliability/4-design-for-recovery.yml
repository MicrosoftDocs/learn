  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "Which of the following is an example of metrics that help drive your disaster recovery plans?"
    choices:
    - content: "Number of successful backups per day"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Tracking your successful backups is important for your everyday operations, but isn't a component of a disaster recovery plan."
    - content: "Average time between deployment failures"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Measuring the time between deployment failures can help you understand your deployment velocity, but isn't a component of a disaster recovery plan."
    - content: "Hours of downtime per month"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Tracking your downtime is important to maintain your SLAs, but it doesn't drive your disaster recovery plans."
    - content: "Average time to restore a database from backup"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Your disaster recovery plans should include metrics that help you understand how long it takes to restore your services."
  - content: "Which of the following scenarios is an example of how to deal with stateful data for recovery purposes?"
    choices:
    - content: "Moving cold data to archive storage"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Archive storage data isn’t stateful data. It’s data that is rarely accessed and is stored for long periods of time."
    - content: "Migrating from App Service to Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The application data for both services is stored in a database, so changing the compute model won't affect the stateful data stored in the database."
    - content: "Using Azure SQL Database instead of SQL Server on a VM"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Changing the deployment model for your database doesn't address dealing with the recovery of stateful data."
    - content: "Changing from a single region deployment of Cosmos DB to a multi-region deployment"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Cosmos DB is a stateful service, so changing from a single region deployment to a multi-region deployment replicates your data to multiple regions, which lowers your RTO and RPO."
  - content: "Contoso has a mission-critical line-of-business application in Azure. What is one way they could implement self-healing to improve the reliability of their application?"
    choices:
    - content: "Use Azure Monitor actions to automatically restart the application if it fails"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Azure Monitor actions can be used to automatically perform actions when an alert is triggered. In this case, the action would be to restart the application."
    - content: "Use Azure Policy to check for compliance with the company's security policies"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Azure Policy is used to enforce compliance with company policies, but it can't perform self-healing actions."
    - content: "Increase the backup frequency of the application's database"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This change would improve the recoverability of the application, but it introduces self-healing capabilities in the workload."
    - content: "Use Azure Advisor to identify potential performance issues with the application"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Azure Advisor can be used to identify potential performance issues, but it can't perform self-healing actions."
