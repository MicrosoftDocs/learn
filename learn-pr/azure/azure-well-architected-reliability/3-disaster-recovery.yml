    - content: "How to restore backups."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The steps to restore backups are a critical piece of a recovery plan."
    - content: "How to fail over to replicated systems."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The process to fail over to replicated systems is a critical piece of a recovery plan."
    - content: "How to reestablish network connectivity to on-premises or external networks."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The steps to reestablish network connectivity to on-premises or external networks are critical pieces of a recovery plan."
    - content: "How to implement replication from scratch."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "You don't implement replication from scratch. Most fully featured database products and services include some kind of replication as a tightly integrated feature."
  - content: "Are data replication and data backup the same thing?"
    choices:
    - content: "Yes."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Both data replication and data backup copy your data, but the frequency and usage of the data are different."
    - content: "No."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Replication creates real-time or near-real-time copies of live data to use in failover, while backup creates long-lived, read-only snapshots of data to use in recovery."
