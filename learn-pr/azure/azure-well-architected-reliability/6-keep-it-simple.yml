  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "Why should you try to minimize the number of components in your workload?"
    choices:
    - content: "Minimizing the components in your workload reduces the complexity, which makes it easier to manage and troubleshoot."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The more components you have, the more complex your workload is. This makes it more difficult to manage and troubleshoot."
    - content: "Minimizing the number of components in your workload means you don't have to monitor the workload."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. You should always monitor your workload, regardless of how many components it has."
    - content: "Minimizing the number of components in your workload means you can use services that are in preview."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. You should never use services that are in preview in production workloads."
    - content: "Minimizing the number of components in your workload reduces the need to enable scaling."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Your scaling strategy should be based on the needs of your workload, not the number of components it has."
  - content: "What elements of your software development lifecycle should be standardized?"
    choices:
    - content: "Development languages, frameworks, and tools"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. These elements are all important, but they aren’t the only elements that should be standardized."
    - content: "Documentation"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Documentation is important, but it isn’t the only element that should be standardized."
    - content: "Testing"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Testing is important, but it isn’t the only element that should be standardized."
    - content: "All of the above"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. All of these elements should be standardized to ensure that your workload is reliable and easy to manage."
  - content: "How did moving to Azure App Services help the Contoso team simplify their workload?"
    choices:
    - content: "It saved them from having to rewrite the application."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Rewriting the application wasn't a concern for the Contoso team."
    - content: "It allowed them to reduce the amount of code they had to maintain."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. By moving to Azure App Services, the Contoso team was able to reduce the amount of code they had to maintain by removing the instrumentation code."
    - content: "It allowed them to containerize their application."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The team didn't containerize the app."
    - content: "It allowed the team to move to a serverless architecture."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Azure App Services isn’t a serverless architecture."
