The Reliability pillar in the Azure Well-Architected Framework helps ensure that your workload is resilient, available, and recoverable.

You have to be prepared for outages and malfunctions in your workload. A reliable workload must survive those events and **keep running smoothly**. It must be **resilient** enough to detect, withstand, and recover from failures quickly. It must also be **available** so that users can access it when they need to, at the promised quality level.

Your workload's architecture should include **reliability measures in its application code, infrastructure, and operations**. Design choices should strive to align with business requirements without making major trade-offs.

The concepts described in this module aren't all-inclusive of reliability in a workload, but they represent the core principles and some of their key approaches. For a complete overview of the Well-Architected Framework pillars, check out the [Azure Well-Architected Framework](/azure/well-architected) as you start planning and designing your architecture.

Each unit in this module dives into one [design principle](/azure/well-architected/reliability/principles) and three approaches for that principle. You can find examples of the approaches in each unit to see how they can be applied to real-world scenarios. The examples are all based on fictional companies.
