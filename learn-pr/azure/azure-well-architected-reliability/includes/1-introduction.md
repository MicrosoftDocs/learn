The Azure Well-Architected Framework is a guide that helps you build a solid and reliable workload. The Reliability pillar helps ensure that your workload is:

- **Resilient, available, and recoverable.**
- Worth the investment.
- Developed and operated responsibly.
- Meeting its goals on time.

You have to be prepared for outages and malfunctions in your workload. A reliable workload must survive those events and **keep running smoothly**. It must be **resilient** enough to detect, withstand, and recover from failures quickly. It must also be **available** so that users can access it when they need to, at the promised quality level.

Your workload's architecture should include **reliability measures in its application code, infrastructure, and operations**. Design choices should strive to align with business requirements without making major trade-offs.

The concepts described in this module are not all-inclusive of reliability in a workload, but they represent the core principles and some of their key approaches. For a complete overview of the Well-Architected Framework pillars, check out the [Azure Well-Architected Framework](/azure/well-architected) as you start planning and designing your architecture.

Each unit in this module dives into one [design principle](/azure/well-architected/reliability/principles) and three approaches for that principle. You can find examples of the approaches in each unit to see how they can be applied to real-world scenarios. The examples are all based on a fictional company.

## Learning objectives

By the end of this module, you'll be more familiar with the five principles of the Reliability pillar and learn three approaches for each pillar. You'll learn how to:

- Figure out your business's reliability requirements, and apply those requirements to your workload design.
- Design your system to handle faults smoothly and keep working even when things go wrong.
- Make sure that your workload can recover from malfunctions, whether it's a small glitch or major disaster.
- Include ways to monitor and test your workload in both its design and daily operations.
- Keep your workload simple to minimize risks.

## Prerequisites

- Experience with core infrastructure technologies such as data storage, computing, and networking.
- Experience building or operating technology systems to solve business problems.
