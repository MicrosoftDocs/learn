This module presented key principles of the Reliability pillar of the Azure Well-Architected Framework. You learned how to make your applications more reliable by planning and architecting high availability (HA), disaster recovery (DR), and backup and restore.

In this module, you learned to carry out the following procedures:

- Determine the availability service level agreement (SLA) for your applications.
- Define Recovery Point Objective (RPO) and Recovery Time Objective (RTO) as part of DR planning.
- Test your recovery plans to ensure they provide sufficient protection for your applications.
- Incorporate backup and restore into your recovery strategy to help protect against data loss.

You learned about the following technologies and services:

- Azure availability sets and availability zones to provide HA for virtual machine (VM) workloads.
- Load balancing services such as Azure Traffic Manager, Azure Application Gateway, and Azure Load Balancer to distribute load across available systems.
- Azure platform as a service (PaaS) services that have HA built in.
- Azure Site Recovery to provide recovery capabilities for your applications.
- Azure Backup for VMs, and the backup and restore capabilities of several Azure PaaS services.
