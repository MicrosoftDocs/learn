In this module, you learned about the five key principles of the Reliability pillar in the Azure Well-Architected Framework.

Outages and malfunctions are normal for cloud workloads on distributed systems. So it's important to design your system to handle these problems and build in reliability measures to keep things running smoothly. Focus on maximizing availability with redundancy, scalability, design patterns, and good operational practices. When problems do happen, aim to minimize their impact by using proven design patterns. A strong observability platform helps teams react efficiently to potential or active problems.

Balancing reliability with other pillars like Performance Efficiency and Cost Optimization is crucial for success.
