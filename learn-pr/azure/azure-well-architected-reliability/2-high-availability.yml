  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "Why is it important to define an SLA for your application?"
    choices:
    - content: "An SLA helps you determine your backup retention requirements."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Backup retention is important to define, but SLA doesn't drive that definition."
    - content: "An SLA helps you determine the availability level that you commit to for your customers."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "A service level agreement is a commitment you make to your customers for the availability of your service."
    - content: "You can use an SLA as an argument for automating VM creation."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "There are good arguments for automating VM creation, but your SLA probably doesn't affect the outcome."
    - content: "You use an SLA to define access control settings for your resources."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Access control settings are important, but they aren't related to SLA."
  - content: "Which of the following technologies isn't used to make an architecture more highly available?"
    choices:
    - content: "Load balancing."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "A highly available architecture uses load balancing to distribute load to available systems and remove failed systems from the load."
    - content: "Availability zones."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "A highly available architecture uses availability zones to distribute systems across multiple datacenters within a region."
    - content: "Availability sets."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "A highly available architecture uses availability sets to minimize the impact from localized failures and maintenance events."
    - content: "Recovery Services vaults."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Recovery Services vaults provide a destination for backups, but they aren't part of a highly available architecture."
