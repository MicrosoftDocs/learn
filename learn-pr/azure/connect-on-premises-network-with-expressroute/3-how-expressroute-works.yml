  questions:
  - content: "What is Microsoft peering?"
    choices:
    - content: "It provides a direct connection from your on-premises network to an Azure datacenter."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "No. Microsoft peering enables you to connect your on-premises network to Office 365 services and Dynamics 365."
    - content: "It enables you to connect your on-premises network to Office 365 services and Dynamics 365."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct."
    - content: "It provides a connection between your on-premises network and an ExpressRoute provider."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "No. Microsoft peering enables you to connect your on-premises network to Office 365 services and Dynamics 365."
    - content: "It provides a point-to-site connection for computers in your on-premises location to Office 365 services."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "No. Microsoft peering enables you to connect your on-premises network to Office 365 services and Dynamics 365."
  - content: "What is an ExpressRoute circuit?"
    choices:
    - content: "An ExpressRoute circuit implements a site-to-site connection across a VPN connection to an Azure datacenter."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "No. A circuit provides a physical connection for transmitting data through the ExpressRoute provider's edge routers to the Microsoft edge routers."
    - content: "An ExpressRoute circuit is a direct hard-wired connection between your on-premises datacenter and an Azure datacenter."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "No. A circuit provides a physical connection for transmitting data through the ExpressRoute provider's edge routers to the Microsoft edge routers."
    - content: "A backup service that provides connectivity to the Microsoft cloud if your VPN connection fails."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "No. A circuit provides a physical connection for transmitting data through the ExpressRoute provider's edge routers to the Microsoft edge routers."
    - content: "A circuit provides a physical connection for transmitting data through the ExpressRoute provider's edge routers to the Microsoft edge routers."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct."
  - content: "What security benefits does Azure ExpressRoute provide?"
    choices:
    - content: "An ExpressRoute connection is automatically encrypted, to help protect traffic that passes across the internet to the Microsoft cloud."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "No. ExpressRoute uses a dedicated, private network to connect to the Microsoft cloud. Traffic doesn't traverse the internet, so it's difficult to intercept."
    - content: "The speed at which data traverses an ExpressRoute connection makes it impossible to intercept by network monitors and packet sniffers."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "No. ExpressRoute uses a dedicated, private network to connect to the Microsoft cloud. Traffic doesn't traverse the internet, so it's difficult to intercept."
    - content: "ExpressRoute uses a dedicated, private network to connect to the Microsoft cloud. Traffic doesn't traverse the public internet, so it's difficult to intercept."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct."
    - content: "ExpressRoute uses a proprietary transmission protocol that constantly varies, so it's difficult to intercept traffic."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "No. ExpressRoute uses a dedicated, private network to connect to the Microsoft cloud. Traffic doesn't traverse the internet, so it's difficult to intercept."
