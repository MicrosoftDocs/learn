In a perfect world, all of your employees understand the importance of information protection and work within your policies. In the real world, it's likely that a busy partner who often works with accounting information might inadvertently upload a sensitive document to a cloud repository with incorrect permissions. A week later, you realize that your enterprise's confidential information was leaked to your competitors.

## What is sensitive data?

Before learning about protecting data, you need to identify the data that needs protection. It's important to understand that not all data need protection, and not all data need the same level of protection. For example, you might need to implement strong protection methods for your financial data, but you might not need to include any protection with some marketing materials. Also, you might need to protect personal data so that only you can access it, while protecting important financial data in a way that a few authorized people can access it.

Although the specific definition of sensitive data might differ for different scenarios, sensitive data is generally defined as information that needs protection from unauthorized access. You can usually achieve that protection by implementing appropriate data security and information protection technologies. In some cases, such as sensitive data in paper form, you might need to include physical security as well. There are several technologies and methods for sensitive data protection that you can use to prevent unauthorized access or data leakage.

Reasons to protect sensitive data include:

- Personal privacy
- Regulatory requirements
- Intellectual property
- Ethical or legal requirements

For example, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which primarily protects personal data, considers the following personal data sensitive:

- Personal data that reveals racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, and religious or philosophical beliefs
- Trade-union membership
- Genetic data and biometric data that's processed solely to identify a human being
- Health-related data
- Data concerning a person’s sex life or sexual orientation

## Discover and protect sensitive data

If you're incorporating sensitive data protection in your organization, you need to account for several steps during the process. It's not enough just to choose a technology to protect data. If you don't properly identify sensitive data, protection technology won't help much. Also, if you don't have a consistent process for classifying data (both sensitive and non-sensitive), you won't be able to efficiently implement protection technology. Another important consideration is data monitoring. If you don't monitor your sensitive data through its lifecycle, protection won't be efficient, because you won't know if it really works properly.

Data location is also important. Today, data can be found everywhere&#8212;on mobile devices, on cloud storage services, and on your local file server infrastructure. You need to consider all the possible locations where sensitive data might reside, and the network paths along which it might transit.

The Microsoft approach to sensitive data protection consists of four phases that allow you to protect your data through its entire lifecycle and across multiple locations and devices. These phases are:

- Discover your data
- Classify sensitive information
- Protect your data
- Monitor and report on your data

The following image depicts the Microsoft approach to information protection.

You can use this approach to help ensure that all your sensitive data will be discovered, classified, protected, and monitored. Later in this module, you’ll also learn about specific technologies that you can use to:

- Define and discover sensitive data for your specific scenario.
- Protect the data.
- Monitor data usage.
