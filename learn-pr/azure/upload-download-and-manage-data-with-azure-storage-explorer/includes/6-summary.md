Your CRM application is a complex system that stores data in Azure Storage in Azure Data Lake Storage. You wanted an easy-to-use tool that helps your engineers to administer the data in the different Azure locations.

You can use Azure Storage Explorer to give your developers a tool that manages and controls data stored in Azure, including Azure Data Lake Gen1 and Gen2.

You can explore your Azure data with many different tools, depending on its location and your preference. For example, the Azure portal includes a web-based interface that presents the contents of a storage account. Or you can use the Azure CLI at the command line.
