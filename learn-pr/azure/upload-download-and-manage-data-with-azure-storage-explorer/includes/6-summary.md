Your CRM application is a complex system that stores data in Azure Storage in Azure Data Lake Storage. You wanted an easy-to-use tool that helps your engineers to administer the data in the different Azure locations.

You can use Azure Storage Explorer to give your developers a tool that manages and controls data stored in Azure, including Azure Data Lake Gen1 and Gen2.

You can explore your Azure data with many different tools, depending on the data location and your preference. For example, the Azure portal includes a web-based interface that presents the contents of a storage account, but you can also use the Azure CLI at the command line.

In this module, you explored different ways to use Storage Explorer to connect to your storage accounts. You used the Azure CLI to create Data Lake Gen2 enabled storage accounts. Finally, you connected Storage Explorer to Data Lake Storage. Then you uploaded and viewed the data that's stored there.
