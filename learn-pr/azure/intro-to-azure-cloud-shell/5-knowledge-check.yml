  questions:
  - content: "Which of the following methods can you use to access Azure Cloud Shell from a computer running Windows 11?"
    choices:
    - content: "Install Windows Subsystem for Linux and make an SSH connection to Azure."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. You can't make remote SSH connections to Azure Cloud Shell."
    - content: "Make a Remote Desktop Protocol connection to Azure."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. You can't establish a Remote Desktop Connection to Azure Cloud Shell."
    - content: "Use the Edge Browser to log into an Azure Subscription."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. You open Azure Cloud Shell once logged into your Azure subscription with a web browser."
  - content: "You need to perform routine checks on your Azure Kubernetes Cluster via kubectl. Which of the following is a way to achieve this?"
    choices:
    - content: "Install kubectl and the Azure CLI on your machine, download the kube config, and establish a connection."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This solution assumes you're using a terminal on your own machine."
    - content: "Open Azure Cloud Shell, use `az aks get-credentials` to download the kube config file to the Cloud Shell session and establish a connection."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Kubectl is native to Azure Cloud Shell. You can simply retrieve the connection file using `az aks get-credential` and connect your cluster."
    - content: "Create a new Azure VM, download kubectl, and establish a new connection."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Azure Cloud Shell is available on any supported internet browser, so there's no need to install a new VM."
  - content: "You want to store a script that you constantly use for operations on Azure resources. This script needs to be rapidly available when you open a new Azure Cloud Shell session. Which of the following is the best way to do this?"
    choices:
    - content: "Upload the script to your CloudDrive on an Azure Cloud Shell session."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Azure Cloud Shell provides access to CloudDrive natively from inside the Cloud Shell session."
    - content: "Create a new script and store it on an Azure Storage Blob."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Newly created Azure Storage Blobs won't be automatically visible from the Cloud Shell session."
    - content: "Use Cloud Shell editor to create and edit the script you want to use."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. If you have an existing script, you can simply upload it to CloudDrive, there's no need to recreate it from the Editor."
  - content: "You have a script stored on the Cloud Shell storage. You constantly use this script for resource management, but you need to perform small changes to it. Which of the following is the best way to handle this?"
    choices:
    - content: "Download the script from the Azure Cloud Shell session, edit the script, and upload it back before using it."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. You can reduce the overhead of download and upload by simply using the native Editor from the Cloud Shell session."
    - content: "Push the script to GitHub and run it from the Azure Cloud Shell session."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. GitHub is a great source control for DevOps scenarios, but a simple script can be stored on the CloudDrive for administrative purposes."
    - content: "Use the Cloud Shell editor to make the necessary changes and save it directly on the CloudDrive."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Saving your script directly on the CloudDrive is the most appropriate method."
