      explanation: "Correct. You open Azure Cloud Shell once logged into your Azure subscription with a web browser."
  - content: "You want to store a script that you constantly use for operations on Azure resources. This script needs to be rapidly available when you open a new Azure Cloud Shell session. Which of these procedures should you use?"
    choices:
    - content: "Upload the script to your CloudDrive on an Azure Cloud Shell session."
      isCorrect: true
