Whatever SLA, RTO, and RPO your business requires, Azure SQL has the options and built-in capabilities to meet that availability. In this module, you'll learn how to translate your knowledge of backup and restore, failover cluster instances, and Always On availability groups to the options for business continuity in Azure SQL. You'll also peek under the hood at the architectures and how they affect availability.

## Learning objectives

By the end of this module, you'll be able to:

* Create a backup and restore strategy for your organization.
* Evaluate the architectures associated with each service tier.
* Understand options for getting higher availability.
* Describe how availability and consistency apply to Azure SQL.
* Configure and monitor availability.

## Prerequisites

* Experience working with, maintaining, and developing with SQL Server
* Experience with Azure, such as deploying and managing resources

For the exercises, we provide sandbox environment for Azure resources. To complete the exercises, you need to ensure your local computer meets a few requirements:  

* Use a Windows computer or VM. SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) is available only on Windows.
* Download and install [the latest version of SSMS](/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms?azure-portal=true).
* Download and install [the latest version on Azure Data Studio](/sql/azure-data-studio/download-azure-data-studio?azure-portal=true).
* Download the [zip file](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/mslearn-azure-sql-fundamentals/archive/master.zip?azure-portal=true) or clone the repository from [GitHub](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/mslearn-azure-sql-fundamentals?azure-portal=true) to access lab files. Extract the contents of the zip file to a folder similar to `C:\Users\<YourUserName>\` so you can access the files easily during the exercises.

If you can't meet these prerequisites, you can still read through the module and watch demos of the exercises.
