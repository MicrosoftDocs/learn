Depending on the SLA, RTO, and RPO your business requires, Azure SQL has the options and built-in capabilities to meet that availability. In this module, you will learn how to translate your knowledge of backup/restore, failover cluster instances, and Always On Availability Groups to the options for business continuity in Azure SQL. You'll also take a peek under the hood at the architectures and how they affect availability.

## Learning objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

* Create a backup/restore strategy for your organization
* Evaluate the architectures associated with each service tier
* Understand options for getting higher availability
* Describe how availability and consistency applies to Azure SQL
* Configure and monitor availability

## Prerequisites

* Experience working with, maintaining, and developing with SQL Server
* Experience with Azure, such as deploying and managing resources

For the exercises, a sandbox environment is provided for Azure resources. However, you need to do a few things on your local machine in order to complete the exercises:  

* Use a Windows machine or VM (SSMS is only available on Windows)  
* Download and install [the latest version of SSMS](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms?azure-portal=true)
* Download and install [the latest version on Azure Data Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/azure-data-studio/download-azure-data-studio?azure-portal=true)
* Download the [zip file](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/mslearn-azure-sql-fundamentals/archive/master.zip?azure-portal=true) or clone the repository from [GitHub](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/mslearn-azure-sql-fundamentals?azure-portal=true) to access lab files. Extract the contents of the zip file to something similar to `C:\Users\[YourUsername]\` so you can access it easily in the exercises.

If you cannot complete the prerequisites, you can still go through the module and see demos of the exercises.
