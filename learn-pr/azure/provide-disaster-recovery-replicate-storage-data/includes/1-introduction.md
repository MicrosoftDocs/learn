Azure Storage lets you replicate data across regions for increased availability and resilience against failures.

You're an administrator for a music streaming service.  Your organization uses Azure Blob storage to store about 2 petabytes of audio file data. You use Zone-Redundant Storage (ZRS) to replicate the data across multiple availability zones in a single region. Uptime is important to you and your users. If your audio files aren't available, you may lose subscribers to another service. You have a plan in place to recover from a zone failure. But you want to explore other redundancy options that protect from region-wide outage and practice a storage failover.

By the end of this module, you'll see how to improve the availability of your data by replicating it across regions. You'll also start a failover to a secondary region.

## Learning objectives

By the end of this module, you'll be able to:

- Choose the right Azure Storage redundancy option for your organization
- Demonstrate how to initiate a storage account failover

## Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of Azure Storage, which includes the use of storage accounts and Azure Blobs
