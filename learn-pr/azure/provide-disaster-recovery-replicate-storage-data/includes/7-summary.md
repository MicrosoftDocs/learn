You investigated the different replication types for Azure Storage to help identify the right Azure Storage redundancy option for your organization. Your organization is currently using zone-redundant storage (ZRS) to replicate its music data across multiple availability zones in a single region. But you want to protect your data, and thereby your customer base, from a region-wide outage by using geo-zone-redundant storage (GZRS).

You also learned how the failover process works and how to do a failover in the Azure portal.

## Clean up

When you're working in your own subscription, it's a good idea at the end of a project to identify whether you still need the resources you created. Resources left running can cost you money. You can delete resources individually or delete the resource group to delete the entire set of resources.
