You investigated the different replication types for Azure Storage to help identify the right Azure Storage redundancy option for your organization. Your organization is currently using zone-redundant storage (ZRS) to replicate its music data across multiple availability zones in a single region.

You also learned how the failover process works, and how to do a failover in the Azure portal.
