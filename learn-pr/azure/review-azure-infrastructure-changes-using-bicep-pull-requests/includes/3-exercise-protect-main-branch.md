Your team is working on a Bicep template that already contains a website and a database. You've deployed the components to your production environment. Now, you need to update your Bicep template to add your order processing queue.

In this exercise, you'll create a feature branch for your change. You'll also protect your main branch and only allow changes to be merged to the main branch after they've been reviewed. Before that, though, you need to make sure that your environment is set up to complete the rest of this module.

During the process, you'll:

::: zone pivot="github"

> [!div class="checklist"]
>
> - Set up a GitHub repository for this module.
> - Clone the repository to your computer.
> - Add branch protection to your repository's main branch.
> - Create a local feature branch for your change.
> - Try to merge your feature branch into main.

::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="azurerepos"

> [!div class="checklist"]
>
> - Set up an Azure DevOps project for this module.
> - Clone the project's repository to your computer.
> - Add branch policies to your repository's main branch.
> - Create a local feature branch for your change.
> - Try to merge your feature branch into main.

::: zone pivot="github"

## Get the GitHub repository

Here, you make sure that your GitHub repository is set up to complete the rest of this module. You set it up by creating a new repository based on a template repository. The template repository contains the files that you need to get started for this module.

### Start from the template repository

Run a template that sets up your GitHub repository.

> [!div class="nextstepaction"]
> [Run the template](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/mslearn-review-azure-infrastructure-changes-using-bicep-pull-requests)

On the GitHub site, follow these steps to create a repository from the template:

1. Select **Use this template** > **Create a new repository**.

   :::image type="content" source="../media/3-template.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the GitHub interface that shows the template repo, with the button for using the current template highlighted.":::

1. Enter a name for your new project, such as _toy-website-review_.

1. Select the **Public** option.

   When you create your own repositories, you might want to make them private. In this module, you'll work with features of GitHub that work only with public repositories and with GitHub Enterprise accounts.

1. Select **Create repository from template**.

   :::image type="content" source="../media/3-repo-settings.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the GitHub interface that shows the repo creation page.":::

::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="azurerepos"

## Get the Azure DevOps project

Here, you make sure that your Azure DevOps organization is set up to complete the rest of this module. You set it up by running a template that creates a project in Azure DevOps.

> [!div class="nextstepaction"]
> [Run the template](https://azuredevopsdemogenerator.azurewebsites.net/?name=bicepreview)

On the Azure DevOps Demo Generator site, follow these steps:

1. Select **Sign In** and accept the usage terms.

1. On the **Create New Project** page, select your Azure DevOps organization. Then enter a project name, such as _toy-website-review_.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/3-create-new-project.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows creating a project through the Azure DevOps Demo Generator.":::

1. Select **Create Project**.

    The template takes a few moments to run. It automatically creates a pipeline and Bicep file that you'll use in later exercises.

1. Select **Navigate to project** to go to your project in Azure DevOps.

::: zone-end

## Clone the repository

::: zone pivot="github"

You now have a copy of the template repository in your own account. Clone this repository locally so you can start working in it.

1. Select **Code**, and then select the **Copy** icon.

   :::image type="content" source="../media/3-github-repository-clipboard.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the GitHub interface that shows the new repository, with the repository U R L copy button highlighted.":::

1. Open Visual Studio Code.

1. Open a Visual Studio Code terminal window by selecting **Terminal** > **New Terminal**. The window usually opens at the bottom of the screen.

1. In the terminal, go to the directory where you want to clone the GitHub repository on your local computer. For example, to clone the repository to the _toy-website-review_ folder, run the following command:

   ```bash
   cd toy-website-review
   ```

1. Type `git clone` and paste the URL that you copied earlier, and then run the command. The command looks like this:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mygithubuser/toy-website-review.git
   ```

1. Reopen Visual Studio Code in the repository folder by running the following command in the Visual Studio Code terminal:

   ```bash
   code -r toy-website-review
   ```

::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="azurerepos"

You now have a project in your own account. Clone this repository locally so you can start working in it.

1. Select **Repos** > **Files**.

   :::image type="content" source="../media/3-repos-files.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Azure DevOps that shows the Repos menu, with Files highlighted.":::

1. Select **Clone**.

   :::image type="content" source="../media/3-repos-clone.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Azure DevOps that shows the repository, with the Clone button highlighted.":::

1. If you're using macOS, you need a special password to clone the Git repository. Select **Generate Git credentials** and copy the displayed username and password to somewhere safe.

1. Select **Clone in VS Code**. If you're prompted to allow Visual Studio Code to open, select **Open**.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/3-repos-clone-visual-studio-code.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Azure DevOps that shows the repository settings, with the button for cloning in Visual Studio Code highlighted.":::

1. Create a folder to use for the repository, and then choose **Select Repository Location**.

1. You're using this repository for the first time, so you're prompted to sign in.

   - If you're using Windows, enter the same credentials that you used to sign in to Azure DevOps earlier in this exercise.

   - If you're using macOS, enter the Git username and password that you generated a few moments ago.

1. Visual Studio Code prompts you to open the repository. Select **Open**.

   :::image type="content" source="../../includes/media/open-cloned-repo.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Visual Studio Code that shows a prompt to open the cloned repository, with the Open button highlighted.":::

::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="github"

## Add branch protections

Configure your Git repository to prevent direct pushes to the main branch.

1. In your browser, select **Settings**.

1. Select **Branches**.

1. Select **Add branch protection rule**.

   :::image type="content" source="../media/3-github-branch-protections.png" alt-text="Screenshot of GitHub that shows the page for adding branch protection rules, with the button for adding a rule highlighted.":::

1. In the **Branch name pattern** text box, enter _main_.

1. Select **Require a pull request before merging**.

   Clear **Require approvals**. Normally, you'd select this option. But in this example, you're going to merge your own pull request, and the **Require approvals** option prevents you from doing so.

1. Select **Do not allow bypassing the above settings**.

   You select this setting as an example to show how `git push` to `main` fails later in this exercise. In a production environment, you might not want to restrict direct merges to `main` for administrators or repository owners.

1. Near the bottom of the page, select **Create**.

   :::image type="content" source="../media/3-github-branch-protections-add.png" alt-text="Screenshot of GitHub that shows the Create button.":::

   GitHub might ask you to sign in again to confirm your identity.

::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="azurerepos"

## Add branch policies

Configure your Git repository to prevent direct pushes to the main branch.

1. In your browser, go to **Repos** > **Branches**.

1. Hover over the **main** branch, and select the three dots.

1. Select **Branch policies**.

   :::image type="content" source="../media/3-repos-branch-policies.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Azure DevOps that shows the list of branches, with the context menu displayed and the menu item for branch policies highlighted.":::

1. In the **Branch policies** window, change the **Require a minimum number of reviewers** setting to **On**.

1. Change the minimum number of reviewers to **1**, and select the **Allow requestors to approve their own changes** option.

   :::image type="content" source="../media/3-repos-branch-policy-main.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Azure DevOps that shows the branch policies page for the main branch.":::

   > [!NOTE]
   > Here, you enable the **Allow requestors to approve their own changes** option. In these exercises, you're working on your own, so you need to both create and approve your changes. But in a real team environment, you might not want to enable this option.

::: zone-end

## Create a local feature branch

1. In the Visual Studio Code terminal, run the following statement:

    ```bash
    git checkout -b add-orders-queue
    ```

    This command creates a new feature branch for you to work from.

1. Open the _main.bicep_ file in the _deploy_ folder.

   :::image type="content" source="../media/3-visual-studio-code-main-bicep.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Visual Studio Code that shows the main dot bicep file in the deploy folder.":::

1. Below the parameters, add a new variable for the name of the queue:

   :::code language="bicep" source="code/3-main-final.bicep" range="17-18" highlight="2" :::

1. Within the storage account resource, add the queue as a nested child resource:

   :::code language="bicep" source="code/3-main-final.bicep" range="20-38" highlight="12-18" :::

1. In the `appService` module definition, add the storage account and queue names as parameters:

   :::code language="bicep" source="code/3-main-final.bicep" range="40-49" highlight="6-7" :::

   This code enables the application to find the queue where it will send messages.

1. Save the _main.bicep_ file.

1. Open the _appService.bicep_ file in the _deploy/modules_ folder.

1. Near the top of the _appService.bicep_ file, add new parameters for the storage account and queue names:

   :::code language="bicep" source="code/3-appservice-final.bicep" range="1-18" highlight="7-8, 10-11" :::

1. Update the `appServiceApp` resource to propagate the storage account and queue names to the application's environment variables:

   :::code language="bicep" source="code/3-appservice-final.bicep" range="31-50" highlight="7-18" :::

### Commit and push your feature branch

::: zone pivot="github"

Commit your changes and push them to your GitHub repository by running the following commands in the Visual Studio Code terminal:

::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="azurerepos"

Commit your changes and push them to your Azure Repos repository by running the following commands in the Visual Studio Code terminal:

::: zone-end

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add orders queue and associated configuration"
git push --set-upstream origin add-orders-queue
```

The feature branch is pushed to a new branch, also named _add-orders-queue_, in your remote repository.

## Try to merge the feature branch to main

::: zone pivot="github"

You've learned why it's not advisable to push directly to the main branch. Here, you try to break that guideline so you can see how your main branch's protection prevents you from accidentally pushing your changes to a protected branch.

1. In the Visual Studio Code terminal, run the following statements to switch to the main branch and merge the _add-orders-queue_ branch into it:

   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git merge add-orders-queue
   ```

   The command worked, but you merged the _add-orders-queue_ branch into your main branch in only your _local_ Git repository.

1. Run the following statement to try to push your changes to GitHub:

    ```bash
   git push
   ```

   Notice that your push fails with an error message that looks like this one:

   :::code language="plaintext" source="code/3-merge-error-github.txt" highlight="3" :::

   The error message tells you that pushes to the main branch aren't permitted, and that you must use a pull request to update the branch.

1. Undo the merge by running the following statement:

   ```bash
   git reset --hard HEAD~1
   ```

   This command tells your local Git repository to reset the state of the main branch to what it was before the last commit was merged in, and not to save your changes. The _add-orders-queue_ branch isn't affected.
