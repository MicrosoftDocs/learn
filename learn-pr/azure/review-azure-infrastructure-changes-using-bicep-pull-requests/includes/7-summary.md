Your team wanted a way to protect the Bicep code on your main branch and prevent accidental changes that might affect your production Azure resources. You wanted to review any Bicep code before it's merged into your main branch.

In this module, you learned how to use feature branches to separate your team's in-progress work from the Bicep code that you use for your real Azure environments. You also learned how to use pull requests so that your team can review your Bicep code changes before they're merged and deployed.

You've now increased your team's confidence in your Bicep development process and reduced the chances of anyone deploying faulty Bicep code to your production environment.
