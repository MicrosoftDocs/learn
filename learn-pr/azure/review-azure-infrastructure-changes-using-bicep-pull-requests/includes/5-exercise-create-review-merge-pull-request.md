## Create a pull request to merge the feature branch

Because you can't push changes directly to your repository's main branch, you need to create a pull request.

::: zone pivot="github"

1. In your browser, go to **Code**.

1. Select **2 branches** to list the branches in your GitHub repository.

   :::image type="content" source="../media/5-github-branches.png" alt-text="Screenshot of GitHub that shows the repository page with the link to the branch list highlighted.":::

1. Next to **add-orders-queue**, select the **More** icon (**...**), then select **New pull request**.

   :::image type="content" source="../media/5-github-new-pull-request.png" alt-text="Screenshot of GitHub that shows the branch list. The button for a new pull request is highlighted for the add-orders-queue branch.":::

1. When you created the pull request, notice that GitHub automatically used the Git commit message as the pull request's title.

   Update the description to the following text:

   _This PR adds a new Azure Storage queue for processing orders, and updates the website configuration to include the storage account and queue information._

1. Select **Create pull request**.

   :::image type="content" source="../media/5-github-pull-request-create.png" alt-text="Screenshot of GitHub that shows the pull request creation page, with the button for creating a pull request highlighted.":::

::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="azurerepos"

1. In your browser, go to **Repos** > **Files**.

   Notice that Azure DevOps shows a banner that indicates there are changes in the _add-orders-queue_ branch. The banner offers to create a pull request for those changes.

## Review the pull request

Normally, a pull request is reviewed by someone other than its author. For this example, you'll pretend to be another team member and review your own pull request.

::: zone pivot="github"

1. From the pull request page, select the **Files changed** tab.

   :::image type="content" source="../media/5-github-pull-request-review-files-changed.png" alt-text="Screenshot of GitHub that shows the tab for changed files in a pull request.":::

   GitHub shows you the files that were changed in this pull request. Notice that it highlights all of the lines that have changed, so you can easily see what you should review.

   > [!TIP]
   > Imagine that you're reviewing this for your own team. Would you make any suggestions?

1. In the _main.bicep_ file that was changed, hover over line 18 and select the button with the **plus sign** (**+**).

   :::image type="content" source="../media/5-github-pull-request-review-line.png" alt-text="Screenshot of GitHub that shows changes to the main dot bicep file. The mouse is hovering over line 18, and the button for adding comments is highlighted.":::

1. In the comment box, enter the following text: _Should this be capitalized?_

1. Select **Start a review**.

   :::image type="content" source="../media/5-github-pull-request-review-comment.png" alt-text="Screenshot of GitHub that shows the comment field, with the button for starting a review highlighted.":::

   > [!TIP]
   > GitHub doesn't let you approve your own pull requests. Here, you'll comment on your pull request, but won't approve it. When you work with your own team's pull requests, this is the point at which you'd approve it to indicate you're happy for it to be merged.

1. Select **Finish your review**.

1. In the review panel that appears, select **Submit review**.

   :::image type="content" source="../media/5-github-pull-request-review-submit.png" alt-text="Screenshot of GitHub that shows the panel for finishing a review, with the button for submitting a review highlighted.":::

   The width of your browser window can affect how the comment dialog box is displayed. The comment will open a **Discussion** dialog box rather than the inline comment as shown in the screenshot.

1. Select **Approve**.

   :::image type="content" source="../media/5-repos-pull-request-approve.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Azure DevOps that shows the Approve button for the pull request.":::

   After you select **Approve**, the **Set auto-complete** changes to **Complete**. You'll use that feature later in this unit.
