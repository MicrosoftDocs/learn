  title: Hardware and cost of the Data Science Virtual Machine
  questions:
    - content: "On what hardware does the Data Science Virtual Machine run?"
      choices:
        - content: "On your local client machine."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "The Data Science Virtual Machine runs on Azure compute resources that you can match to your changing needs."
        - content: "On any internet-accessible computer with compatible hardware."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "The Data Science Virtual Machine runs on Azure compute resources that you can match to your changing needs."
        - content: "On an Azure compute resource that you can customize to your needs and budget. After you specify the resource, you can't change the hardware."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "The Data Science Virtual Machine runs on Azure compute resources that you can match to your changing needs."
        - content: "On an Azure compute resource that you can customize to your needs and budget. You can change this resource as your needs change."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "The Data Science Virtual Machine runs on Azure compute resources that you can match to your changing needs."
    - content: "Using GPU resources on the Data Science Virtual Machine requires:"
      choices:
        - content: "The Data Science Virtual Machine doesn't support GPU scenarios."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "GPU support depends on the chosen compute resource. Preinstalled tools are configured to use the GPU on appropriate hardware."
        - content: "GPU support is universally available on Data Science Virtual Machines."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "GPU support depends on the chosen compute resource. Preinstalled tools are configured to use the GPU on appropriate hardware."
        - content: "GPU support is available only on GPU-enabled Azure compute resources and requires no user configuration."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Preinstalled tools are configured to use the GPU on appropriate hardware. GPU support depends on the chosen compute resource."
        - content: "GPU support is available only on GPU-enabled Azure compute resources and requires user configuration."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Preinstalled tools are configured to use the GPU on appropriate hardware. GPU support depends on the chosen compute resource."
    - content: "Charges for the Data Science Virtual Machine start and stop:"
      choices:
        - content: "From creation of the Data Science Virtual Machine until you delete the resource."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Charges are based on machine uptime. You can configure a daily shutdown to catch mistakes."
        - content: "From when you start the Data Science Virtual Machine to when you stop it."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Charges are based on machine uptime. You can configure a daily shutdown to catch mistakes."
        - content: "From when you sign in to the Data Science Virtual Machine until you sign out."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Charges are based on machine uptime, not user activity. You can configure a daily shutdown to catch mistakes."
        - content: "For the time that any process on the Data Science Virtual Machine is running under your account."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Charges are based on machine uptime, not user activity. You can configure a daily shutdown to catch mistakes."
