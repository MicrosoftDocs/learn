  questions:
  - content: Which of the following options isn't a benefit of using application volume groups for Azure NetApp Files?
    choices:
    - content: One step deployment of your single-host SAP HANA system
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. In addition to low latency and high-provisioning, one-step deployment of your single-host SAP HANA system is a key benefit of using application volume groups. 
    - content: Automatic QoS provisioning
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. You must use manual QoS with application volume groups. 
    - content: Low latency and high provisioning
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. Low latency and high-provisioning as well as one-step deployment of your single-host SAP HANA system are key benefits of using application volume groups. 
  - content: SAP HANA systems require low latency and high performance. Azure NetApp Files leverages meets this demand with proximity placement groups. What role do proximity placement groups serve?
    choices: 
    - content: Determine throughput limits on your SAP HANA system
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Incorrect. Although application volume groups help you configure throughput options, they don't configure limits. 
    - content: Ensure compute resources are placed adjacently to ensure compute performance and low latency
      isCorrect: true 
      explanation: Correct. Due to the low latency and performance requirements, application volume groups ensure 
    - content: Determine the region of your Azure NetApp Files deployment
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. Application volume groups ensure compute resources are placed adjacently. You select the region of deployment. 
  - content: Before requesting a proximity placement group, you must first.
