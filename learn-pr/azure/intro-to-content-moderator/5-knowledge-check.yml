    - content: "To allow users to enter acceptable terms for online forum discussions, based on their region."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. It's not a good policy to allow end users to control acceptable content. So, allowing them to change custom term lists isn't a good practice."

    choices:
    - content: "To test your marketing campaign's content effectiveness in reaching the target audience."

      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Content Moderator can scan the content of these web sites, and you may use custom term lists to determine if specific words are present. But, using the Content Moderator service in this way, isn't a viable scenario."
