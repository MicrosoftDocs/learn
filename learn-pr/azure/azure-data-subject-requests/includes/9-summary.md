In this module, you learned more about DSRs and various processes for responding to them. You’ve learned about responding to customer data requests and system-generated log requests in both Azure and Microsoft 365 or Office 365. You reviewed Microsoft products and services that might be the focus of a DSR based on GDPR and CCPA definitions of personal data. You’ve also learned how to respond to a DSR in various scenarios by using available Microsoft <!-- ID/SME: Verify that these are indeed Microsoft tools and Microsoft cloud services.-->tools to fulfill the DSRs in Microsoft cloud services. You’ve  responded to a DSR in a test environment. You should now have enough information to present to the legal department and alleviate their concerns.<!-- Acrolinx doesn't like that each sentence starts with You/You've, and that it sounds so formal. I'm not sure how to fix this though. -->
