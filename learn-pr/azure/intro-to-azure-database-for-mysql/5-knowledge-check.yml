quiz:
  questions:
  - content: "What is required to manage high availability for MySQL on Azure VMs?"
    choices:
    - content: "Azure Portal interface"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While the Azure Portal is used for management, setting up high availability specifically requires more than just interface manipulation."
    - content: "Manual configuration of replication and failover"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. High availability for MySQL on Azure VMs requires manual setup of replication and failover mechanisms."
    - content: "Automatic patching and updates"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Automatic patching and updates help maintain the system but do not establish high availability."
  - content: "For which scenario is Azure Database for MySQL particularly useful?"
    choices:
    - content: "Applications requiring frequent manual database upgrades"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Azure Database for MySQL - Flexible Server is designed to minimize the need for frequent manual interventions."
    - content: "Workloads that benefit from automated backup and scaling features"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Azure Database for MySQL - Flexible Server offers automated backups and scaling features that support dynamic workloads efficiently."
    - content: "Environments where direct server hardware management is required"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Azure Database for MySQL - Flexible Server is a managed service, so direct hardware management is not applicable."
  - content: "Which Azure Database for MySQL - Flexible Server SKU is most appropriate for low-cost development and low concurrency workloads?"
    choices:
    - content: "Burstable"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The Burstable SKU is designed for scenarios that require low-cost development and sporadic bursts of performance."
    - content: "General Purpose"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The General Purpose SKU is intended for production workloads requiring balanced compute and memory resources."
    - content: "Business Critical"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The Business Critical SKU is meant for the most demanding database applications, requiring high throughput and low latency."
  - content: "What feature of Azure Database for MySQL allows for automatic scaling of IOPS based on workload needs?"
    choices:
    - content: "Elastic pools"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Elastic pools are used to manage and scale multiple databases that have varying performance needs, not automatic scaling of IOPS."
    - content: "Autoscale IOPS"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Autoscale IOPS feature dynamically adjusts the I/O throughput based on the current workload, automatically scaling up or down as needed."
    - content: "Load balancing"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Load balancing distributes client requests across multiple servers but does not directly influence IOPS scaling."
  - content: "Which of these considerations is a good reason for using MySQL on Azure VMs as a hosting option for your database apps?"
    choices:
    - content: "Avoiding the time and expense of acquiring new on-premises hardware to host your legacy database application."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. This consideration is valid."
    - content: "Online Storage scaling is required."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The Online Storage scaling feature is only available with Azure Database for MySQL."
    - content: "Automatic backups are required."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Automatic backups are a feature of Azure Database for MySQL."
