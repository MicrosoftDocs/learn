## Scenario

You work for a franchise-based business. You started with the company five years
ago as a systems administrator and recently moved into a new role as a DevOps engineer. One of your
tasks on your previous team was to create Azure resources for new franchises. Because
your previous team manually created the resources by using the Azure portal, the resources often lacked
standardization and were time consuming to create.

Your first task in your new role as a DevOps engineer is to automate the provisioning of each new
franchise's Azure resources. You want to learn what the possibilities are for automation tools and
evaluate each of them.

As a proof of concept, you decide to summarize your findings and provide sample code for each
offering so others on your new team can assist with the decision. The choice of automation tools to
provision Azure resources is an important decision because the process will become part of your
company's standard procedure for opening new franchise locations.

## Learning objectives

- Understand basic concepts of infrastructure as code.
