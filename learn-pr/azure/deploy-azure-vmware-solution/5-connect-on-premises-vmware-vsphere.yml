  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "Which resource is required to configure ExpressRoute peering on the Azure VMware Solution private cloud to the on-premises environment?"
    choices:
    - content: "Customer-provided ExpressRoute circuit"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Azure VMware Solution deploys with an ExpressRoute circuit that connects you to Azure from the bare-metal hosts. Also, a customer-provided ExpressRoute circuit is required to establish full connectivity to Azure VMware Solution from the on-premises environment for migrations."
    - content: "Application gateway"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "An Azure application gateway is a web-traffic load balancer that enables you to manage traffic to your web applications. This functionality isn't required to peer the Azure VMware Solution environment to on-premises."
    - content: "Network virtual appliance"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "A network virtual appliance (NVA) is a virtual appliance that primarily performs network functions through virtualization. This appliance isn't required to peer the Azure VMware Solution environment to on-premises."
  - content: "For on-premises network traffic to reach Azure VMware Solution, which component is required?"
    choices: 
    - content: "Virtual private network"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "A virtual private network provides site-to-site connectivity over the public internet. Azure VMware Solution requires dedicated site-to-site connectivity."
    - content: "ExpressRoute Global Reach"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "ExpressRoute is a dedicated, site-to-site circuit, and Global Reach allows you to connect Azure VMware Solution private cloud ExpressRoute circuits to an on-premises VMware environment. Without Global Reach, the ExpressRoute Gateway doesn't provide transitive routing between its connected circuits."
    - content: "Load balancer"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "A load balancer provides high availability by distributing incoming traffic among healthy VMs. This functionality isn't required for on-premises network traffic to reach Azure VMware Solution."
