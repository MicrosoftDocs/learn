Azure VMware Solution deploys with NSX-T Manager as the software-defined network layer. The networking environment has two gateways:

- NSX-T Tier-0 gateway configured in active-active mode
- NSX-T Tier-1 gateway configured in active-standby mode

Both gateways allow connections between logical switch segments. These gateways also provide East-West and North-South connectivity.

## Set up NSX-T Manager components

After Azure VMware Solution is deployed, the NSX-T components are configured under **Workload Networking** in the Azure portal. The portal provides a simplified view of the management pane for NSX-T operations. If you're unfamiliar with NSX-T Manager, use the portal to configure Azure VMware Solution networking. If you're familiar with NSX-T Manager, you can use the console view within vSphere to configure the advanced network settings and features.

You can configure four options for NSX-T Manager in Azure VMware Solution by using the Azure portal:

- **Segments**: Create network segments that are displayed in NSX-T Manager and vCenter.
- **DHCP**: If you'll use DHCP, create a DHCP server or DHCP relay.
- **Port mirroring**: Set up port mirroring to help troubleshoot network issues.
- **DNS**: Create a DNS forwarder to send DNS requests to a DNS server for resolution.

## Create an NSX-T Manager network segment in the Azure portal

VMs either created in or migrated to Azure VMware Solution should be attached to an NSX-T networking segment. You can create an NSX-T segment from the Azure VMware Solution console within the Azure portal. These NSX-T networking segments are connected to the default Tier-1 gateway. Workloads on these segments will have East-West and North-South connectivity. After the segment is created, it displays in NSX-T Manager and vCenter.

1. In the Azure portal, select your Azure VMware Solution private cloud.
1. Under **Workload Networking**, select **Segments** > **Add**:

    :::image type="content" source="../media/6-add-new-nsxt-segment.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Azure portal showing how to add an N S X-T Manager network segment.":::

1. Provide details for the new logical networking segment:

    :::image type="content" source="../media/6-create-new-segment-details.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Azure portal showing where to provide details for the network segment.":::

    | Field | Value |
    | ----- | ----- |
    | **Segment name** | The name of the logical switch visible in vCenter. |
    | **Connected gateway** | This gateway is selected by default and is read only. |
    | **T1** | The name of the Tier-1 gateway in NSX-T Manager. Segments created by using ASV connect only to the default Tier-1 gateway. Workloads of these segments have East-West and North-South connectivity. More Tier-1 gateways can be created only by using NSX-T Manager. Tier-1 gateways created in NSX-T Manager aren't visible in the Azure VMware Solution console. |
    | **Type** | The overlay network segment supported by Azure VMware Solution. |
    | **Subnet Gateway** | The gateway IP address for the logical switch's subnet, with a subnet mask. VMs are attached to the logical switch, and all VMs connecting to this switch belong in the same subnet. Also, all VMs attached to this logical networking segment must carry an IP address from the same networking segment.
    | **DHCP ranges (optional)** | DHCP ranges for the logical networking segment. A DHCP server or DHCP relay must be configured to use DHCP on the logical networking segments.

1. Select **OK** to create and attach the logical networking segment to the Tier-1 gateway. This segment will now be visible in Azure VMware Solution, NSX-T Manger, and vCenter.

## Create a DHCP server or DHCP relay in the Azure portal

A DHCP server or relay can be created directly from the Azure VMware Solution console within the Azure portal. The DHCP server or relay will connect to the Tier-1 gateway, which is created when Azure VMware Solution is deployed. All segments where DHCP ranges are provided will be part of the DHCP components of NSX-T. After a DHCP server or DHCP relay has been created, you must define a subnet or range on an NSX-T segment to consume the DHCP services:

1. In the Azure VMware Solution private cloud, under **Workload Networking**, select **DHCP** > **Add**.

1. Select either **DHCP Server** or **DHCP Relay**.
1. Provide a name for the server or relay and provide three IP addresses. For a DHCP relay, only one IP address is required.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/6-add-dhcp-server-relay.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Azure portal showing how to add either a D H C P server or a D H C P relay into the A V S private cloud.":::

1. Complete the DHCP configuration by providing DHCP ranges on the logical segments, like those configured previously, then select **OK**.

## Configure port mirroring in the portal

Port mirroring can be configured to monitor network traffic. Port mirroring involves forwarding copies of each network packet from one network switch port to another. Port mirroring places a protocol analyzer on the port that receives all mirrored data. Port mirroring analyzes traffic from a source (a VM or a group of VMs), then sends the traffic to a destination.

To set up port mirroring in the Azure VMware Solution console, you'll first create source and destination VMs or VM groups. The source group has either a single VM or multiple VMs where the network traffic is mirrored.

1. In the Azure VMware Solution private cloud, under **Workload Networking**, select **Port mirroring** > **VM groups** > **Add**.
1. Name the source VM group, select the VMs, then select **OK**.
1. Repeat the preceding step to create the destination VM group.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/6-add-port-mirroring-vm-groups.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Azure portal showing where to configure port mirroring related to destination VMs or VM groups.":::

Next, create a port-mirroring profile by defining the traffic direction for source and destination VM groups.

1. Make sure both the source and destination VM groups have been created.
1. Select **Port mirroring** > **Add**, and then provide the following values:

    :::image type="content" source="../media/6-add-port-mirroring-profile.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Azure portal showing how to add the port-mirroring profile.":::

    | Field   | Value |
    | :---------- | :------------------ |
    | **Port mirroring name** | Provide a name for the profile. |
    | **Direction** | Select **Ingress**, **Egress**, or **Bi-directional**. |
    | **Source** | Select the source VM group. |
    | **Destination** | Select the destination VM group. |
    | **Description** | Provide a description for the port-mirroring configuration. |

1. Select **OK** to complete the profile. The profile and VM groups will now be visible in the Azure VMware Solution console.

## Configure a DNS forwarder in the Azure portal

Now you'll configure a DNS forwarder. Specific DNS requests will be forwarded to a designated DNS server for resolution. A DNS forwarder is associated with a default DNS zone and up to three FQDN zones.

You set up the DNS forwarder in the Azure VMware Solution console. You'll configure a default DNS zone and FQDN zone to send DNS queries to the upstream server. When a DNS query is received, the DNS forwarder compares the domain name in the query with the domain names in the FQDN DNS zone. If a match is found, the query is forwarded to the DNS servers specified in the FQDN DNS zone. If no match is found, the query is forwarded to the DNS servers specified in the default DNS zone. A default zone must be defined before you configure an FQDN zone.

Follow these steps:

1. In your Azure VMware Solution private cloud, under **Workload Networking**, select **DNS** > **DNS zones** > **Add**.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/6-nsxt-workload-networking-dns-zones.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Azure portal showing where to configure D N S zones under Workload Networking.":::

1. Select either **Default DNS zone** or **FQDN zone** and provide:

    - **DNS zone**: A name and up to three DNS server IP addresses in `8.8.8.8` format.
    - **FQDN zone**: A name, the FQDN domain, and up to three DNS server IP addresses in `8.8.8.8` format.

1. To configure the DNS service, select the **DNS service** tab, select **Add**, and then provide this information:

    :::image type="content" source="../media/6-nsxt-workload-networking-configure-dns-service-2.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Azure portal showing the fields for configuring the D N S service.":::

    | Field   | Value |
    | :---------- | :------------------ |
    | **Name** |  Enter a name for the DNS service. |
    | **DNS service IP** | Enter the IP address for the DNS service. |
    | **Default DNS zone** | Select the default DNS zone that you created under the **DNS zones** tab. |
    | **FDQN zones** | Select the FQDN zones that you added under the **DNS zones** tab. |
    | **Log level** | Select the level you want. |

1. Select **OK**. The DNS service is added successfully.

## Verify on-premises network connectivity to the Azure VMware Solution private cloud

You should see where the Azure ExpressRoute circuit connects to the NSX-T network segments and the Azure VMware Solution management segments in the edge router. Each environment is different. You might need to allow routes to propagate back to the on-premises network.

Some environments have firewalls that protect ExpressRoute circuits. If there are no firewalls, try to ping the Azure VMware Solution vCenter server or a VM on the NSX-T segment from your on-premises environment. Also, from the VM on the NSX-T segment, resources should be able to reach the on-premises environment.

## Add a VM on an NSX-T network segment

Deploy a VM to test network connectivity in the Azure VMware Solution vCenter. This VM will help verify network connectivity:

- To and from the internet.
- To and from Azure virtual networks.
- To and from on-premises environments.

Deploy the VM as you would in any vSphere environment:

- Attach the VM to one of the network segments previously created in NSX-T Manager.
- The VM can receive network configuration from a DHCP server, or you can configure the network configuration statically.

## Test the NSX-T segment connectivity

Sign in to the VM created in the previous step and verify connectivity:

1. Ping an IP on the internet.
1. Go to an internet site in a web browser.
1. Ping an internal VM that sits on the Azure virtual network.

If each test works, Azure VMware Solution is now functional. Going through these steps means you've successfully established connectivity to and from an Azure virtual network, and the internet.
