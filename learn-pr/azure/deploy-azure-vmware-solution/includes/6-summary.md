In this module, you learned about all the deployment steps to build and connect Azure VMware Solution to an on-premises VMware environment. You first learned about all the required planning before AVS deployment. Next, you learned about how to deploy AVS, build an Azure Bastion resource, and create a jump host to configure NSX-T Manager and vCenter in the private cloud. From there, you learned how to connect the AVS private cloud to Azure and then to an on-premises VMware environment through peering ExpressRoute circuits, creating NSX-T network segments, and enabling Global Reach.

Now that you know how to successfully build and configure AVS, you'll be able to help the healthcare company you work for embrace digital transformation and migrate workloads into Azure.
