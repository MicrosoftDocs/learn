  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: 'What is the difference between classical regression and classification models?'
    choices:
    - content: "Regression models provide labels such as ‘cherry’/’banana’ but classification models calculate continuous numbers"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect."
    - content: "Classification models and linear regression models are two names for the same thing"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect."
    - content: "Classification models provide labels such as ‘cherry’/’banana’ but regression models calculate continuous numbers"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct."
  - content: 'How can we improve real-world model performance?'
    choices:
    - content: "By adding features"
      isCorrect: false

    - content: "Both adding and removing features can be useful, depending on the situation"

    - content: "By removing features"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect."
  - content: 'What is one reason why logistic regression uses log-loss rather than a more intuitive cost function?'
    choices:
    - content: "Log-loss is stricter about model errors, even if they're close to correct"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct."
    - content: "It's the only way to calculate error for categorical labels"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect."
