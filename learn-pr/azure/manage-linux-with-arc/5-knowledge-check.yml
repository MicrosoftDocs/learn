  - content: "What type of Linux resources can Azure Arc help you manage?"
    choices:
    - content: "Virtual resources."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This is incorrect. Azure Arc can be used to manage both physical and virtual Linux machines out of Azure."
    - content: "Physical resources."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This is incorrect. Azure Arc can be used to manage both physical and virtual Linux machines out of Azure."
    - content: "Both physical and virtual resources."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! Azure Arc can be used to manage both physical and virtual Linux machines out of Azure."

  - content: "Linux machines managed by Azure Arc have what Azure capabilities?"
    choices:
    - content: "Linux machines on Azure Arc enjoy the same capabilities as native Azure Linux resources."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! Linux machines onboarded to Azure Arc enjoy the same capabilities as native Azure machines."
    - content: "A subset of Azure capabilities focused on security."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This is incorrect. Linux machines onboarded to Azure Arc enjoy the same capabilities as native Azure machines, including robust security capabilities."
    - content: "Linux machines onboarded to Azure Arc have limitations that make them more difficult to manage than other Azure resources."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This is incorrect. Linux machines onboarded to Azure Arc enjoy the same capabilities as native Azure machines and are just as easy to manage."

  - content: "What is required in order to use SSH for Linux machines connected to Azure Arc?"
    choices:
    - content: "A public IP address."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This is incorrect. You don't need to expose a public IP address to use SSH to access a Linux machine connected to Azure Arc."
    - content: "The opening of an additional inbound port."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This is incorrect. You don't need to open any additional inbound ports to use SSH to access a Linux machine connected to Azure Arc."
    - content: "Installation of the SSH extension."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! Once a Linux resource is fully Arc enabled, you need to install the SSH extension on your workstation and then run a simple command to enable the SSH connection."

  - content: "What Azure tools can be used specifically to help you manage large numbers of Linux machines in Azure Arc?"
    choices:
    - content: "Azure Policy and Azure Automanage."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! Once your Linux machines are onboarded to Azure Arc, you can use tools like Azure Policy and Azure Automanage to enforce standards and simplify ongoing management."
    - content: "Microsoft Sentinel and Microsoft Defender."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This is incorrect. Although Microsoft Sentinel and Microsoft Defender both work with Arc-enabled Linux machines, they're tools specifically designed for security enhancement."
    - content: "Arc SSH and Microsoft Entra ID."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This is incorrect. Although Arc SSH and Microsoft Entra ID both work with Arc-enabled Linux machines, their primary purpose is security and connection related."
