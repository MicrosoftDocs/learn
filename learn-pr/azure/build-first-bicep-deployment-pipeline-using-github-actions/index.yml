title: Build your first Bicep deployment workflow by using GitHub Actions
summary: |
  In this module, you'll create an automated workflow in GitHub Actions that securely deploys resources to Azure from Bicep code. You'll also learn to configure your workflow to run on a schedule or when your configuration changes.

  After completing this module, you'll be able to:
    - Automate Bicep deployments by using a workflow in GitHub Actions.
    - Set up a workload identity to authenticate a workflow to Azure.
    - Select an appropriate workflow trigger and set of tasks for a Bicep deployment.
prerequisites: |
  You should be familiar with using:

  - Bicep, including creating and deploying basic files
  - Azure, including the Azure portal, subscriptions, resource groups, and resources
  - Basic Git commands, including cloning, committing files, and pushing changes to GitHub
