Before you can deploy your toy company's website by using a workflow, you need to enable your workflow to authenticate to Azure. In this exercise, you'll:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Create a resource group for your website.
> * Create an Azure AD service principal and grant it access to the resource group.
> * Create an GitHub secret and configure it to use the service principal's credentials.

This exercise requires that you have permissions to create applications and service principals in your Azure AD directory. If you can't meet this requirement with your current Azure account, you can get a [free trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?azure-portal=true) and create a new Azure subscription and tenant.

## Sign in to Azure

::: zone pivot="cli"

To work with service principals in Azure, sign in to your Azure account from the Visual Studio Code terminal. Be sure that you've installed the [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?azure-portal=true) tools.

[!include[](../../includes/azure-exercise-terminal-cli.md)]

### Sign in to Azure by using the Azure CLI

1. In the Visual Studio Code terminal, run the following command to sign in to Azure:

   ```azurecli
   az login
   ```

1. In the browser that opens, sign in to your Azure account.

::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="powershell"

To deploy this template to Azure, sign in to your Azure account from the Visual Studio Code terminal. Be sure that you've [installed Azure PowerShell](/powershell/azure/install-az-ps?azure-portal=true), and sign in to the same account that you used to activate the sandbox.

[!include[](../../includes/azure-exercise-terminal-powershell.md)]

### Sign in to Azure by using Azure PowerShell

1. In the Visual Studio Code terminal, run the following command to sign in to Azure:

   ```azurepowershell
   Connect-AzAccount
   ```

1. In the browser that opens, sign in to your Azure account.

::: zone-end

## Create a resource group in Azure

::: zone pivot="cli"

1. To create a new resource group, run this Azure CLI command in the Visual Studio Code terminal:

   ```azurecli
   az group create --name ToyWebsite --location westus
   ```

1. Look at the JSON output from the command. It includes an `id` property, which is the resource group's ID.

   Copy the resource group ID somewhere safe. You'll use it soon.

::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="powershell"

1. To create a resource group, run this Azure PowerShell command in the Visual Studio Code terminal:

   ```azurepowershell
   New-AzResourceGroup -Name ToyWebsite -Location westus
   ```

1. Look at the output from the command. It includes a `ResourceId`, which is the resource group's fully qualified ID.

   Copy the resource group ID somewhere safe. You'll use it soon.

::: zone-end

## Create a service principal and grant it access to the resource group

::: zone pivot="cli"

1. To create a service principal and assign it the Contributor role for your resource group, run the following Azure CLI command in the Visual Studio Code terminal. Replace the placeholder with the resource group ID you copied in the last step.

   ```azurecli
   az ad sp create-for-rbac \
     --name ToyWebsiteWorkflow \
     --role Contributor \
     --scopes RESOURCE_GROUP_ID \
     --sdk-auth
   ```

   [!INCLUDE [](../../includes/azure-template-bicep-exercise-cli-unique-display-name.md)]

1. Select the JSON output from the previous command. It looks like this:

   ```json
   {
     "clientId": "c6bf233f-d1b8-480a-9cf7-27e2186345d2",
     "clientSecret": "<secret value>",
     "subscriptionId": "f0750bbe-ea75-4ae5-b24d-a92ca601da2c",
     "tenantId": "dbd3173d-a96b-4c2f-b8e9-babeefa21304",
     "activeDirectoryEndpointUrl": "https://login.microsoftonline.com",
     "resourceManagerEndpointUrl": "https://management.azure.com/",
     "activeDirectoryGraphResourceId": "https://graph.windows.net/",
     "sqlManagementEndpointUrl": "https://management.core.windows.net:8443/",
     "galleryEndpointUrl": "https://gallery.azure.com/",
     "managementEndpointUrl": "https://management.core.windows.net/"
   }
   ```

   Copy the entire output somewhere safe, including the curly braces. You'll use it soon. 

::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="powershell"

1. To create a service principal and assign it the Contributor role for your resource group, run the following Azure PowerShell code in the Visual Studio Code terminal. Replace the placeholder with the resource group ID you copied in the last step.

   ```azurepowershell
   $resourceGroupId = 'RESOURCE_GROUP_ID'

   $azureContext = Get-AzContext
   $servicePrincipal = New-AzADServicePrincipal `
   -DisplayName ToyWebsiteWorkflow `
   -Role Contributor `
   -Scope $resourceGroupId

   $output = @{
      clientId = $($servicePrincipal.ApplicationId)
      clientSecret = $([System.Net.NetworkCredential]::new('', $servicePrincipal.Secret).Password)
      subscriptionId = $($azureContext.Subscription.Id)
      tenantId = $($azureContext.Tenant.Id)
   }
   $output | ConvertTo-Json
   ```

1. Select the JSON output from the previous command. It looks like this:

   ```json
   {
     "clientId": "c6bf233f-d1b8-480a-9cf7-27e2186345d2",
     "clientSecret": "<secret value>",
     "subscriptionId": "f0750bbe-ea75-4ae5-b24d-a92ca601da2c",
     "tenantId": "dbd3173d-a96b-4c2f-b8e9-babeefa21304"
   }
   ```

   Copy the entire output somewhere safe, including the curly braces. You'll use it soon.

::: zone-end

## Create a GitHub secret

You've created a resource group and a service principal. Next, create a secret in GitHub Actions.

1. In your browser, navigate to your GitHub repository.

1. Select **Settings** > **Secrets**.

1. Select **New repository secret**.

   :::image type="content" source="../../includes/media/github-create-repository-secret.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the GitHub interface showing the 'Secrets' page, with the 'Create repository secret' button highlighted." border="true":::

1. Name the secret *AZURE_CREDENTIALS*.

1. In the **Value** field, paste the JSON object that you copied in the previous section.

1. Select **Add secret**.
