  questions:
  - content: You're creating a workflow that should run whenever a pull request is opened or the code on the source branch is updated. Which of the following triggers should you use?
    choices:
    - content: |
        `workflow_dispatch`
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. The `workflow_dispatch` trigger is used to manually invoke a workflow.
    - content: |
        `pull_request`
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. The `pull_request` trigger fires at various points during the pull request lifecycle.
    - content: |
        `push`
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. The `push` trigger fires whenever a change is committed or pushed to a specific branch or set of branches, whether or not there's an active pull request.
  - content: Which of the following is a benefit of using ephemeral environments within your pull request review process?
    choices:
    - content: You can see how your changes will work when they're deployed.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. When you use ephemeral environments, your changes in each pull request are deployed to a temporary environment for you to inspect.
    - content: You can reduce the cost of your Azure resources.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. Ephemeral environments ordinarily require your workflows to deploy more resources, but the resources remain deployed only while the pull request is open.
    - content: You can see a list of the changes that Azure will make to your environment when you deploy to production.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. The *what-if* operation provides a list of the resource changes that would take effect in a deployment.
  - content: You're concerned that your workflow's workload identity might accidentally make changes to your production environment. What should you do?
    choices:
    - content: Deploy a dedicated subscription for your ephemeral environments, and grant the workload identity access to that subscription only.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. By creating a narrowly scoped role assignment, you can ensure that your workload identity is limited to working only with your ephemeral environments.
    - content: Use Microsoft Cost Management budgets to control access to your production environment.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. Cost Management budgets are a useful cost management tool, but they don't help you manage access to your environments.
    - content: Deploy resource locks to block the workload identity from making changes to your production environment.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. Locks prevent any changes to a resource. Consider using narrowly scoped role assignments instead.
