    title: Knowledge check
    questions:
    - content: "You're moving an application and database to Azure, but your database is currently 62 TB and will continue to grow. You don't currently use any instance-scoped features. Which Azure SQL deployment option will be easiest to use?"
      choices:
      - content: "SQL Server in an Azure virtual machine"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "This option will work, but is there a PaaS offering?"
      - content: "Azure SQL Managed Instance"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "62 TB is bigger than the maximum size allowed for this deployment option."
      - content: "Azure SQL Database, single database"
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "Azure SQL Database, single database, is currently the only deployment option that supports databases of that size, specifically with the Hyperscale service tier. If Azure SQL Managed Instance supports Hyperscale in the future, because the application doesn't currently need any instance-scoped features, Azure SQL Database might still be the right option."
      - content: "Azure SQL Database, elastic database pool"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "62 TB is bigger than the maximum size allowed for this deployment option."
    - content: "Imagine you have Azure SQL Database with the serverless compute tier database deployed and an autopause delay of two hours. After two hours of no activity, what happens to your database and incurred charges?"
      choices:
      - content: "Azure will pause your database to stop compute costs and charge you only for storage."
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "To reduce your costs during times of inactivity, Azure will pause the compute resources and will charge only for storage during this time."
      - content: "Database resources are reduced to a lower service tier to reduce costs."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "The service tier of the database doesn't change when you use serverless compute."
