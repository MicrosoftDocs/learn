    questions:
    - content: "Consider this scenario: you want to migrate to the cloud, but you use a third-party application that requires access to the operating system (OS). Which Azure SQL deployment option will be easiest to use?"
      choices:
      - content: "SQL Server in an Azure virtual machine"
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "Correct! Only SQL Server in an Azure virtual machine gives you access to the underlying OS. In the PaaS deployment options, the OS is abstracted away from you, meaning Azure manages it, but you can't access it."
      - content: "Azure SQL Managed Instance"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Only one deployment option gives you OS-level access."
      - content: "Azure SQL Database, single database"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Only one deployment option gives you OS-level access."
      - content: "Azure SQL Database, elastic database pool"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Only one deployment option gives you OS-level access."
    - content: "Consider this scenario: you want to migrate to the cloud and remove some of the management associated with SQL Server, but your application uses CLR and Service Broker capabilities from SQL Server. Which Azure SQL deployment option will be easiest to use?"
      choices:
      - content: "SQL Server in an Azure virtual machine"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "This option will work, but is there an option that removes some of the management overhead?"
      - content: "Azure SQL Managed Instance"
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "Azure SQL Managed Instance is the only PaaS service that supports instance-scoped features like CLR and Service Broker. The first answer choice is also correct, but it doesn't provide the benefits that PaaS can offer."
      - content: "Azure SQL Database, single database"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Azure SQL Database doesn't support instance-scoped features like Service Broker and CLR."
      - content: "Azure SQL Database, elastic database pool"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Azure SQL Database doesn't support instance-scoped features like Service Broker and CLR."
