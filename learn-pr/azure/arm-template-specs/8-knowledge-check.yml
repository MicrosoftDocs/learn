      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. Template specs can always be used to deploy to another Azure resource group, whether you change the version number or not.
  - content: You created and published a template spec that includes a parameter. Which of these statements is true?
    choices:

    - content: Template specs can't have parameters.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. Template specs allow you to have parameters, just like other templates.

      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. Parameters in template specs work the same way as other templates. If a default value isn't specified in the template, then the user who runs the deployment needs to provide the parameter value.

    - content: Template specs control the lifetime of your Azure resources.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. Template specs don't change the way your Azure resources are deleted or managed.
    - content: Template specs guarantee that your templates deploy.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. Template specs aren't guaranteed to deploy. There are many reasons why a template spec might not deploy to a specific environment.
