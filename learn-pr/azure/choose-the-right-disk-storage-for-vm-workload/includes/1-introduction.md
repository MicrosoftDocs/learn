Azure virtual machines use virtual disks to store data, in the same way that physical servers use hard drives. When you create a virtual machine, you need to know which kinds of disks to create.

Suppose your healthcare organization is beginning a lift-and-shift migration to the cloud, where they plan to run many of their systems on Azure virtual machines. These systems have various usage and performance profiles. Your organization is unsure of the types of disk storage available to them and which ones they should use for each workload. They need to balance performance, features, and cost to identify the right disk for each system.

In this module, you learn about managed disks and disk types, such as Ultra disks, solid-state drives, and hard disk drives.

By the end of this module, you're able to choose the optimal disk types for each virtual machine that you create in Azure based on your performance, cost, and functional requirements.
