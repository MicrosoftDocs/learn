This module will teach you how to create a Mixed Reality experience that features UI elements, 3D model manipulation, model clipping, and eye-tracking features. You'll also learn how to create a PC app for Holographic Remoting that lets you connect to the HoloLens 2 at any time and visualize your app in 3D.

Imagine a scenario where you want to preview and debug your application during the development process. PC Holographic Remoting helps you do just that, and much more. You can run your app locally in the Unity editor on your PC in Play Mode and stream the experience to your HoloLens. This provides a way to quickly debug your app without building and deploying an entire project.

In this module, you'll learn how to create a mixed-reality experience demonstration and a PC app for Holographic Remoting.
