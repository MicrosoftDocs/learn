The Holographic Remoting Player is a companion program that links to Holographic Remoting-compatible PC apps and games. Holographic Remoting uses a Wi-Fi connection to transmit holographic content from a PC to your Microsoft HoloLens in real time.

You can only use PC apps that intend to support Holographic Remoting with the Holographic Remoting Player.

## InternetClientServer capabilities

The Network Client-server manager is used to manage the connections in many multiuser applications, but you can also use the lower-level `NetworkServer` and `NetworkClient` classes directly. Every application that uses the high-level APIs must connect to a host server where each user can act as a client, a dedicated server or, a server and client simultaneously.

## OpenXR

OpenXR is an open standard for creating high-performance VR apps that can run on different kinds of systems. It makes VR creation easier by allowing developers to use the same code across several platforms.

## Eye gaze interaction

Unity OpenXR supports the Eye Tracking Interaction extension provided by Kronos. To get the pose data that the extension returns, use this layout.

## Microsoft hand interaction

Unity OpenXR supports the HoloLens 2 Hand interaction profile. Bindings that use XR Controller and are available on this device will bind appropriately because the layout is adapted from XR Controller.
