# Summary 
In this tutorial, you learned to build a mixed reality experience demonstrating UI elements, 3D model manipulation, model clipping, and eye-tracking features. The tutorial provided you with NextButton and PreviousButton that let you explore the 3D model viewer experience. The ClippingObjectButton made you turn on clipping objects and experience clipping feature. The tutorial also provided you with an eye-tracking element to enable highlighting the tooltips in the experience.
 
You also learnt how to create a Holographic Remoting remote app and connect to HoloLens 2 at any point, providing a way to visualize 3D content in mixed reality. Once the HoloLens connected to the Holographic Remoting PC application, you should see the mixed reality experience streaming into your HoloLens 2 device.
