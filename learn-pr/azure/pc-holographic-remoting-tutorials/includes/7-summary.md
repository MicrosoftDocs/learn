This module taught you to build a Mixed Reality experience that demonstrates UI elements, 3D model manipulation, model clipping, and eye-tracking features. It also provided you with NextButton and PreviousButton objects which let you explore the 3D model viewer experience. The ClippingObjectButton lets you turn on clipping objects and experience the clipping feature. You also learned how to create a Holographic Remoting remote app and connect to HoloLens 2 at any point, providing a way to stream your 3D content and visualize it in Mixed Reality.

## Next steps

Consider trying the following interactions:

* Develop an application to experience on HoloLens 2, but actually runs on PC.
* Include voice commands in your application
