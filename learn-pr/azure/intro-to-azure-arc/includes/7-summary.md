Contoso wants to modernize its environment and take advantage of Azure's capabilities, but they also need to operate an on-premises environment. They need a way to apply the same policies to their on-premises Windows Server workloads as they do in Azure. Additionally, administrators need to be able to review on-premises Windows Server instances and Kubernetes clusters together with cloud resources. Azure Arc provides a way to view Contoso's hybrid resources together, and to use the same management tools whether resources are hosted in Azure or in their on-premises datacenter.

In this module, you learned about Azure Arc-enabled servers, Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes clusters, and Azure Arc-enabled data services. You learned how Azure services can be used with Arc-enabled resources to apply policies, monitor data, and enhance security.
