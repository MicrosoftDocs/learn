Contoso will need to continue to operate an on-premises environment for some time after it begins migrating workloads to Azure IaaS VMs. So, being able to apply Azure policies to on-premises Windows Server workloads is proving to be important. Additionally, administrators need to be able to review on-premises Windows Server instances in the Azure portal. Not only that, but it's important that administrators can use the Azure portal to review Kubernetes clusters.
