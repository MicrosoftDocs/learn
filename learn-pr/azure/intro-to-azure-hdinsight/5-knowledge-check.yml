quiz:
  questions:
  - content: "Which Hadoop component is used to manage resources on a Hadoop system?"
    choices:
    - content: "YARN"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. This is the component that is responsible for managing resources on a Hadoop cluster."
    - content: "Spark"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Spark is a type of Hadoop cluster implementation."
    - content: "MapReduce"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. MapReduce is a programming model that enables you to process and analyze data."
  - content: "What type of file system does Apache Hadoop store data in?"
    choices:
    - content: "It has no storage. Data is stored in memory."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Apache Hadoop requires physical storage to persist data."
    - content: "RDD"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. RDD is an acronym for Resilient Distributed Dataset, which provides an in-memory data engine. A Hadoop system will persist data in storage. It's not an in-memory data platform technology."
    - content: "HDFS"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. HDFS is an acronym for Hadoop Distributed File System, which is the data store for a Hadoop system."
  - content: "Which of the following options is a parallel processing framework?"
    choices:
    - content: "Apache Hive"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Apache Hive in HDInsight is a data warehouse system for Apache Hadoop."
    - content: "Apache Spark"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Apache Spark supports in-memory processing, which helps boost the performance of big-data analytic applications."
    - content: "Apache Kafka"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Apache Kafka is an event streaming platform."
  - content: "In a Hadoop cluster on HDInsight, which of the following nodes is responsible for processing data?"
    choices:
    - content: "Head node"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The head node is responsible for accepting and managing client requests and passing the request to the worker nodes."
    - content: "Worker node"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Worker nodes are responsible for processing data in a cluster."
  - content: "Which of the following scenarios for big data processing enable an organization to prepare big data for further analysis?"
    choices:
    - content: "Data warehousing"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Data warehousing provides an organization with somewhere to store big data while waiting to perform analysis on that data."
    - content: "Data science"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Data science enables an organization to ingest, engineer, model, and evaluate their big data."
    - content: "Batch processing"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Organizations use batch-processing jobs to prepare big data for further analysis."
