  questions:
  - content: "What is mixed reality?"
    choices:
    - content: "A set of virtual reality hardware devices sold by Microsoft"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Virtual reality hardware devices are only a part of mixed reality."
    - content: "A spectrum of immersive experiences, connecting and blending physical and digital worlds together"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Mixed reality can include experiences that overlay virtual content over objects or places in the physical world, as in augmented reality apps, or an immersive virtual experience where the user doesn't have any input from the real world, as in virtual reality apps."
    - content: "An augmented reality platform application that comes with Microsoft HoloLens" 
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Mixed reality is not limited to augmented reality or Microsoft HoloLens."
  - content: "What is the difference between virtual reality and augmented reality experiences?"
    choices:
    - content: "Virtual reality fully immerses a user in a digital environment, whereas augmented reality keeps users in their physical environment."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Virtual reality users aren't aware of their real-world surroundings, but augmented reality relies on the surrounding environment."
    - content: "Augmented reality fully immerses a user in a digital environment, whereas virtual reality keeps users in their physical environment."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Augmented reality applications use the surrounding real-world environment, whereas virtual reality content is totally immersive."
    - content: "Virtual reality content is available only on holographic devices, whereas augmented reality content can run only on immersive equipment."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Virtual reality content is run on immersive headsets, whereas augmented reality content is run on holographic devices."
  - content: "How would you describe a hologram?"
    choices:
    - content: "Immersive 3D objects made of opaque pixels"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Holograms are rendered over the real world and are not opaque."
    - content: "Physical objects that react to digital content"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Holograms are purely digital objects, not physical."
    - content: "Digital objects made of light and sound"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Holograms are digital objects rendered in front of the user's view when the user is wearing a HoloLens device."
  - content: "What tool would a design team use to prototype mixed reality digital interactions, objects, and UI by using crafting materials?"
    choices:
    - content: "Storyboarding"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Storyboarding is a 2D design process that's better suited to advertising content to non-technical team members or stakeholders."
    - content: "Whiteboarding"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Whiteboarding is a 2D design process that's better suited to prototyping outside mixed reality."
    - content: "Bodystorming"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Bodystorming allows you to try out the proposed interactions, features, and mechanics without having to fully prototype them."
  - content: "Mixed reality exists at the crossroads of which of the following?"
    choices:
    - content: "Humans, computers, and environments"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "The intersection of computer processing, human input, and environmental understanding is where the power, creativity, and emerging capabilities of mixed reality come to life."
    - content: "Hardware, software, and industry"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Although hardware, software, and the tech industry are important to mixed reality, they're not the core of what makes mixed reality possible."
    - content: "Manufacturing, education, and training"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Manufacturing, education, and training are common industry use cases and applications for mixed reality."
