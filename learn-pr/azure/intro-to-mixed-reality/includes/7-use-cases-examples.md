In the beginning, computing happened with the creation of mainframe computers. At times, those computers occupied a whole room. Large organizations such as NASA used mainframes for critical applications that processed data. Then came the wave of personal computers (PCs) becoming widely available and connecting people in exponential numbers.

People now have access to various devices that manage data, including Internet of Things (IoT) sensors and mixed reality devices. Everyone has more data than ever before. Using or applying that data through machine learning or with artificial intelligence has never been more powerful.

To be able to process the data and make informed decisions, you need to have access to the data in the right time and right place. In the future, look to mixed reality to bring that data into your context, the real world.

## Common use cases

- *Design and prototyping:* Enables real-time collaborative iteration of 3D physical and virtual models across cross-functional teams and stakeholders.
- *Training and development:* Provides instructors with better tools to facilitate teaching or coaching sessions. It offers trainees an enhanced and engaging learning experience through 3D visualizations and interactivity.
- *Geospatial planning:* Enables the assessment and planning of indoor and outdoor environments. Examples are future construction sites, new store locations, and interior designs. It also removes the need for manual execution.
- *Sales assistance:* Improves the effectiveness of individuals in sales-oriented roles by providing tools that increase customer engagement and strengthen buyer confidence. These tools include 3D catalogs and virtual product experiences.
- *Field service:* Improves the first-visit resolution and customer satisfaction of customer support issues. It's typically used for complex products that would otherwise require a field visit. It can also serve as a platform for targeted up-sell opportunities.
- *Productivity and collaboration:* Transforms the space around you into a shared augmented workplace. Remote users can collaborate, search, brainstorm, and share content as if they're in the same room.
