Now that we’ve covered the conceptual differences between virtual reality and Augmented Reality experiences, and where they fit into Mixed Reality, we can take a look at the hardware devices that you can develop with. 

## HoloLens

For applications and games on the AR side of the spectrum, you would target the Microsoft HoloLens. The HoloLens has a see-through display so users can see the physical environment around them while wearing the headset, with full six-degrees-of-freedom movement for both rotation and translation.

## Windows Mixed Reality immersive headsets

For virtual reality experiences, you can develop for a wide range of Windows Mixed Reality immersive headsets like the Samsung HMD Odyssey+ or the newly released HP Reverb G2. These devices have opaque displays that block out the physical environment and have full six-degrees-of-freedom movement to fully immerse users in a virtual world.

It’s worth noting that whether a device is tethered to a PC or self-contained has no impact on whether the device is holographic (augmented reality) or immersive (virtual reality). Both types of devices can be tethered or untethered.

## The Mixed Reality spectrum revisited

If we take another look at the Mixed Reality spectrum in diagram form, you can see that choosing a target experience for your application corresponds to the type of device you can target. If you’re creating an application that relies on the physical world around the user, the HoloLens is the best bet. Conversely, if you’re going to through your users into the deep end of the spectrum then a Windows Mixed Reality immersive headset is the way to go.

While there isn’t a single device that can run the entire gambit of the Mixed Reality spectrum in today’s technological landscape, the hope is that future holographic devices will become more immersive, while immersive devices will become more holographic.
