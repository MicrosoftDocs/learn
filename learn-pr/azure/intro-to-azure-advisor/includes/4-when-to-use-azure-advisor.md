Azure Advisor can help you optimize your Azure deployments in the following ways:

- **Advisor provides highly personalized recommendations and best practices, which are both actionable and proactive:** Microsoft provides many best practices through the Cloud Adoption Framework and the Well-Architected Framework. Complex scenarios and a mix of different components might make it difficult to be aware of all the details of each recommendation or best practice. Personalized guidance from Azure Advisor can make this challenge less complex.

- **Advisor can help you find ways to reduce costs related to your Azure service subscriptions:** Azure has many services and many different pricing models across them. Cost control is one of the most important disciplines for cloud governance. To help you keep your budget on track, the cost recommendations are fundamental to helping you understand where your costs could be optimized, and where you have opportunities to save money.

- **Advisor can help you improve the security, reliability, operational excellence, and performance of the resources you use:** In a cloud environment, you have changes happening every day. You have automated processes handling the continuous integration of your environments, continuous delivery of your projects, and continuous deployment of your applications. So why not have something to help with continuous improvements? Regular review of the recommendations can go a long way to helping you improve in these key areas.

Azure Advisor is free to use. Carefully consider whether you should apply, or not apply, the recommendations. You need to evaluate what makes sense for your environment. Whether you implement the recommendations or not, using Advisor is something you should consider across your Azure subscriptions.
