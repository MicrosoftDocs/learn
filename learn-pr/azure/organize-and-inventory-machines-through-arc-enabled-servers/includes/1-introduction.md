Azure Arc provides customers with consistent operational experiences across their hybrid, multicloud, and edge infrastructure. In this module, you'll learn about Azure Arc-enabled servers' capabilities to develop a robust inventory of your servers and virtual machines.

Tailwind Manufacturing is a small industrial firm. As the company continues to expand its multicloud investments while running workloads on their private datacenter and factory sites, the need to effectively organize their IT resources is increasingly challenging. By onboarding their non-Azure machines across both industrial floor and business offices to Azure Arc-enabled servers, Tailwind Manufacturing brings together unified resources for their Azure and off-Azure estate.

Through Azure portal, Tailwind IT personnel can quickly tag and categorize all of their VM resources, organizing them into subscriptions and resource groups. Moreover, Azure Resource Graph allows Tailwind to create custom queries and report on server metadata focusing on salient metrics. Finally, Azure Policy works with Tailwind's Arc-enabled resources to deploy and manage virtual machine extensions, extending the capabilities of their VMs for various security and monitoring scenarios.

Offering visibility and governance across their heterogenous infrastructure, Azure Arc helps Tailwind Manufacturing address IT Sprawl.
