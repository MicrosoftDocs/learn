  questions:
  - content: "What is meant by the terms failover and failback in the context of disaster recovery?"
    choices:
    - content: Failover is the transfer of workload from the secondary site to a primary site during a test or disaster recovery scenario. Failback is when the workload gets transferred back to the secondary site.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: These descriptions are incorrect because they're the wrong way around.
    - content: Failover is the time taken between discovering there has been a disaster and invoking actual disaster recovery. Failback is the time taken between fixing the disaster and when the environment is running from the primary site again.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Neither of these definitions are correct because they mention time taken, which is incorrect.
    - content: Failover is the transfer of workload to a secondary site during a test or disaster scenario. Failback is when the workload gets transferred back over to the primary site from the secondary site.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: These descriptions are correct. A failover is when the primary site fails over to the secondary site, and a failback is the reverse.
  - content: "What is the correct order for the four stages of failover and failback when you replicate your on-premises environment to Azure?"
    choices:
    - content: Reprotect Azure virtual machines by replicating back to on-premises. Fail over to the secondary site on Azure. Fail back to the primary on-premises site. Reprotect the on-premises virtual machines by replicating to Azure.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: These stages are all correct, but they're in the wrong order. The correct order is fail over to Azure, reprotect Azure, fail back to on-premises, and reprotect on-premises.
    - content: Fail back to the primary on-premises site. Reprotect the on-premises virtual machines by replicating to Azure. Fail over to the secondary site on Azure. Reprotect the Azure virtual machines by replicating back to on-premises.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: These stages are all correct, but they're in the wrong order. The correct order is fail over to Azure, reprotect Azure, fail back to on-premises, and reprotect on-premises.
    - content: Fail over to the secondary site on Azure. Reprotect the Azure virtual machines by replicating back to on-premises. Fail back to the primary on-premises site. Reprotect the on-premises virtual machines by replicating to Azure.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: These steps are correct and in the right order.
