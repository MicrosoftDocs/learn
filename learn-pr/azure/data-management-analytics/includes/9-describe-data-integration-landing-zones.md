A data integration landing zone serves as a design area where all data integration flows are hosted. It's a special type of data product that provides data orchestration from external sources. The external data sources include telemetry data, finance, CRM, and more. This layer can operate in real time, batch, and microbatch.

## Significance

A data integration zone provides a centralized location. It's a zone to host data flow orchestration to allow for seamless data curation, filtering, transformation and security. If you have a real-time analytics use case, it can host services like Azure Event Hubs. For batch processing, Azure Data Factory is sufficient.
