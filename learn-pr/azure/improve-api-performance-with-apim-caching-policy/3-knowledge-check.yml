  title: Knowledge check
  questions:
  - content: "Which policy would you use to ensure that the Board Pricing API sends all its responses in XML format?"
    choices:
    - content: "JSONP"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This policy permits JSON with padding, which is a cross-domain request technique and has nothing to do with XML. To ensure XML output, use Convert JSON to XML."
    - content: "Convert JSON to XML"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "This policy recodes any response in JSON format as XML text."
    - content: "Find and replace string in body"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This policy finds a specified string and replaces it with another. To ensure XML output, use Convert JSON to XML."
  - content: 'Where would you configure your policy to ensure XML responses?'
    choices:
    - content: "Inbound"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Set this policy in the Outbound tag, because you want to modify responses as they are sent to users."
    - content: "Outbound"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Set this policy in the Outbound tag, because you want to modify responses as they are sent to users."
    - content: "On-error"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Set this policy in the Outbound tag, because you want to modify responses as they are sent to users."
  - content: "What scope would you use for the policy that ensures XML responses?"
    choices:
    - content: "Global scope for the API Management instance"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Do not use the `<json-to-xml>` policy with global scope, because this change would force all responses from the Sales API to use XML, but the website expects JSON responses."
    - content: "Product scope for the Sales product"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Do not use the `<json-to-xml>` policy with product scope, because this change would force all responses from the Sales API to use XML, but the website expects JSON responses. Also, this scope does not apply to the Board Pricing API, which is not part of the Sales product."
    - content: "API scope for the Board Pricing API"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Use the `<json-to-xml>` policy with API scope for the Board Pricing API to ensure that all responses are sent in XML, even if developers coded them to return JSON."
