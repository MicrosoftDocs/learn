Many organizations use APIs to publish data and services. Customers and partners can call these APIs from a client: desktop applications, mobile apps, web apps, and other systems. If your API is popular, you may need to optimize its performance to guarantee service to users.

Suppose you're a developer for a board game company. A product line your company produces has recently become popular. The volume of requests from your retail partners to your inventory API is growing quickly - much faster than the rate your inventory changes. You'd like your API to respond to requests rapidly without incurring load on your API.

You use Azure API Management to host your API. You're considering using an API Management policy to cache compiled responses to requests. You think that this technique will be a way to optimize performance. You want to learn how to write API Management policies and how to use them to set up and control a cache. Then you want to write policies that accelerate responses to users.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you'll:

- Identify whether or not a policy exists for the desired behavior
- Choose a policy scope
- Configure and apply a caching policy in the Azure portal

## Prerequisites
