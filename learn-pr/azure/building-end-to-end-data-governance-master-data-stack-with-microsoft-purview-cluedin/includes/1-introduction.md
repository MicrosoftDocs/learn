Deploy a data technology stack that provides Data Governance, Data Quality, Data Lineage, Data Enrichment and Data Standardization layers to your Azure ecosystem. Combining the power of Microsoft Purview, Azure Data Factory, and CluedIn into a powerhouse of Data Governance and Data Quality. This data pipeline will surface high quality and ready-for-insight data to downstream systems such as Azure Synapse, Power BI, Azure Databricks and more. 

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you'll be able to:

- Set up automated scans on Azure Data Lake Store Gen2 (ADLS Gen2) into Microsoft Purview.
- Set up automated data pipelines from Azure Data Factory to CluedIn through assets registered in Microsoft Purview.
- Stream data from CluedIn to ADLS Gen2.
- Standardize, clean, deduplicate, and enrich your data in CluedIn.

## Prerequisites

- Ability to navigate the Azure portal
- Familiarity with Azure Data Factory
- Familiarity with high-level concepts of Microsoft Purview

## Scenario

Suppose you work for a large B2B consumer goods company and you're wanting to provide your own employees with a self-service way to utilize, discover and build insights out of the data that is scattered across the different operational systems in your business. By now you've probably amassed numerous legacy systems, but the data inside of it's still rich with opportunity. Our job it to make sure we're surfacing this data, and the data from all systems in a way that abstracts away the complexity and promotes the open and creative use of this data to solve day to day, but long-term strategic pieces of the company goals and KPIs.

In this module, you'll create and deploy a data technology stack where we'll be able to share high quality data, with the required services around it, to drive downstream systems with data that will be ready to generate insights in an accelerate fashion.

You'll be working with the following technology stack:

 - ADLS Gen2
 - Microsoft Purview
 - CluedIn
 - Azure Synapse

By the end of this module, you'll be able to build a recommended data management landing zone, as described in the Azure Common Fundamentals Framework that encapsulates Data Governance, Master Data Management, Data Quality and Data Integration.
