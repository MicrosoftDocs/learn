Suppose you work for a large B2B consumer goods company and you want to provide your employees with a self-service way to use, discover, and build insights from data that's scattered across the operational systems in your business. By now you've probably amassed numerous legacy systems, but the data inside is still rich with opportunity. Your job is to make sure you're surfacing this data, and the data from all systems, in a way that abstracts away the complexity and promotes the open and creative use of this data. Both to solve day to day and long-term strategic pieces of the company goals and KPIs.

In this module, you'll create and deploy a data technology stack where we'll be able to share high quality data, to drive downstream systems with data that will be ready to generate insights.

You'll be working with the following technology stack:

 - ADLS (Azure Data Lake Storage) Gen2
 - Microsoft Purview
 - CluedIn
 - Azure Data Factory
 - Azure Key Vault

By the end of this module, you'll be able to build a recommended data management landing zone (as described in the Azure Common Fundamentals Framework) that encapsulates data governance, master data management, data quality, and data integration.
