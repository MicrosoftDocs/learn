  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: You're replicating Hyper-V virtual machines from an on-premises datacenter to Azure. Which of the following Azure Site Recovery items can you use during a failover to recover the virtual machine and its memory state at the time the recovery point was taken?
    choices:
    - content: Crash consistent recovery point
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. A crash-consistent recovery point contains on-disk data, as if you pulled the power cord from the server during the snapshot. It doesn't include anything that was in memory when the snapshot was taken.
    - content: App-consistent recovery point
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. App-consistent recovery points are created from app-consistent snapshots. They capture the same data as crash-consistent snapshots, and in addition capture data in memory, and all transactions in process.
    - content: Hyper-V Snapshot
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. App-consistent recovery points are created from app-consistent snapshots.
  - content: You're replicating Hyper-V virtual machines from an on-premises datacenter to Azure. Which of the following paths to Azure can be the conduit for Azure Site Recovery replication traffic from an on-premises primary site to an Azure secondary site?
    choices:
    - content: Azure Point-to-Site VPN
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. You can't configure replication to occur over an Azure VPN.
    - content: Azure Site-to-Site VPN
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. You can't configure replication to occur over an Azure VPN.
    - content: Azure ExpressRoute
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. While you can't configure replication to occur over a VPN, you can configure replication to occur over Azure ExpressRoute.
  - content: You're replicating Hyper-V virtual machines from an on-premises datacenter to Azure. What's the longest period of time that recovery points are stored?
    choices:
    - content: 24 hours
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. Although the default is 24 hours, recovery points can be stored for a maximum of 15 days.
    - content: 15 Days
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. Recovery points can be stored for a maximum of 15 days.
    - content: 48 hours
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. Recovery points can be stored for a maximum of 15 days.
