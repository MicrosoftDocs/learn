  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "Complete this sentence: The composite SLA uptime for an application built using Azure services is calculated..."
    choices:
    - content: "By adding together the individual SLAs and dividing them by the number of services."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "SLAs aren't derived by the lowest SLA involved, by adding together SLAs, or by averaging SLAs, but as a composite."
    - content: "By considering the lowest SLA for any of the services being used."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "SLAs aren't derived by the lowest SLA involved, by adding together SLAs, or by averaging SLAs, but as a composite."
    - content: "By multiplying together the individual SLAs for any of the services being used."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "A simple example would be an app consisting of Azure App Service (99.95% SLA) and Azure Active Directory (99.9% SLA); the resultant SLA is 99.85%."
  - content: "You're modifying an application architecture that uses Azure DNS to resolve host names to IP addresses. You want the new architecture to support failover to a standby region. What should you do with Azure DNS?"
    choices:
    - content: "Make no changes to Azure DNS."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Azure DNS records are replicated globally by default."
    - content: "Configure Azure DNS to replicate its records to the standby region."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This configuration isn't necessary or possible. Azure DNS records are replicated globally by default."
    - content: "Replace Azure DNS with Azure Traffic Manager."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Azure Traffic Manager can't store DNS records for name resolution."
