quiz:
  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "Which components of the shipping company architecture should be explicitly copied to another region?"
    choices:
    - content: "Azure DNS and Azure AD"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Both Azure DNS and Azure AD are multi-regional by default, so there's no need to copy them."
    - content: "Azure App Service, Azure Function App, Redis Cache, queue"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "These components should be explicitly copied or replicated in another region."
    - content: "Azure DNS, Azure AD, Azure Storage"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Both Azure DNS and Azure AD are multi-regional by default, so there's no need to copy them. Don't copy Azure Storage but rather configure it to be present in more than one region."
  - content: "Complete this sentence: If a regional failure takes out Azure Storage, data loss..."
    choices:
    - content: "Can't occur because all data is automatically copied to a secondary region."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "With the correct configuration, the data is copied but this operation is done asynchronously, so data loss can occur."
    - content: "May briefly occur because data is copied asynchronously."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "With RA-GRS, data is copied asynchronously from primary to secondary so data loss is a possibility."
    - content: "May briefly occur but the data can be restored from the primary region."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Data isn't restored from the primary region if there's a Storage failover to a secondary region."
