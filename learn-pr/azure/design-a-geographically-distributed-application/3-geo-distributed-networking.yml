quiz:
  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "When should you perform a full failover to another region?"
    choices:
    - content: "As soon as the application displays an error."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Transitory, logic, or user errors, which may cause error messages to be displayed, aren't by themselves an indication of a complete regional failure."
    - content: "If you experience notable slowness or a lack of responsiveness"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "An app running slowly might, for example, be the result of the database being overloaded with complex queries, rather than a sign of complete regional failure."
    - content: "When you know definitively that a region is down."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "First, there may be isolated reports from different sources, but they combine together and grow in number and volume until regional failure is the only explanation. Additionally, the Azure team updates the Azure status page with this information."
  - content: "What is the SLA for Azure DNS?"
    choices:
    - content: "100%"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Azure DNS guarantees that valid DNS requests receive a response from at least one name server 100% of the time."
    - content: "99.95%"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Because of the inherently multiregional nature of Azure DNS, it's easier to provide a 100% uptime than for services running in a single region or a couple of regions."

      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Because of the inherently multiregional nature of Azure DNS, it's easier to provide a 100% uptime than for services running in a single region or a couple of regions."
