Microsoft Azure enables you to quickly and efficiently build, deploy, monitor, and scale cloud hosted solutions. Azure's deployment model is flexible. For example, you can develop in Visual Studio, commit your code to GitHub, build with Azure DevOps, and then deploy to Azure. Or you could use a different integrated development environment (IDE) like Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA, develop on Linux, and deploy directly from your development machine to the cloud.

Using Azure means you use your favorite IDE, you choose from a large range of development languages—from C# to Java to Node.js—and you choose your development operating system. Microsoft provides and supports a wide range of development tools for Windows, Linux, and macOS.

Here, you'll learn how to set up your development environment with several popular IDEs.
