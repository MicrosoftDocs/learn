Imagine an oil exploration company that operates offshore drilling platforms in remote locations. These oil rigs are isolated environments with limited internet connectivity due to their distance from mainland infrastructure. The company recognizes the value of HoloLens 2 devices in enhancing safety, efficiency, and maintenance operations on the rigs. In this scenario, a Near Offline Deployment strategy for HoloLens 2 would be the ideal choice. The devices are connected to a highly restrictive network on the offshore oil rig or function as purely offline devices. This deployment scenario allows the company to adhere to stringent security and privacy policies while ensuring critical operations can continue even with restricted network access.

The deployment utilizes Azure AD, Intune, and other tools to support user management, secure authentication, and device management. Workers can sign in using their corporate accounts through IRIS sign-in, a biometric authentication system, ensuring a seamless and secure user experience.

Windows updates, application deployments, and device configurations can be managed through Intune, allowing the company to maintain and update the HoloLens 2 devices even in the absence of a reliable internet connection.

The Near Offline Deployment strategy accommodates the unique challenges of the offshore oil rig environment. The deployment scenario provides the benefits of mixed reality technology, such as remote collaboration, access to technical documentation, and on-the-job training. The scenario addresses the networking limitations that are common in such remote locations.

By using Azure AD, Intune, and other tools, the company can deliver an enhanced user experience and maintain the security and integrity of their operations on the offshore oil rig. This Near Offline Deployment strategy ensures that the HoloLens 2 devices remain effective tools in a challenging and isolated environment, improving safety, productivity, and operational efficiency on the rig.
