In this module, you learned the basics of training and deploying autonomous systems using subject matter expertise registered on the AI-spec. In addition, the different sections of an Inkling file have been understood towards bridging the gap between how humans learn and how AI learns.

If you're an engineer seeking to deploy a brain on-premises, you're one step closer to tackling your problem. Using the Moab example you have been exposed to:

- building a single-concept brain
- assessing the training session through the training graph
- evaluating brain performance through custom assessments and
- understanding how to deploy on-premises or through Azure IoT

Project Bonsai enables engineers to build AI-powered automation using the Machine Teaching paradigm. Engineers can design and train AI brains to do various tasks without data science. With the help of subject matter expertise, you add human intelligence to the machine learning process.

Simultaneously, engineers can safely and quickly validate brains in a simulated environment before deploying them in the real world.
