      Your R&D team has asked you to deploy an Azure SQL database so they can compare it to Azure Cosmos DB.
      A SQL database is a child resource of the Azure SQL logical server resource.
      Which of these statements is true?
    choices:
    - content: The SQL database resource may be in a different resource provider than its parent.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. Child resources always exist within the same resource provider as their parent. Extension resources may exist in different resource providers.
    - content: You can use the `parent` property to tell Bicep about the relationship between the parent and child resources.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. In Bicep, you define child resources by using the `parent` property, by using nested resources, or by constructing a child resource name directly.
    - content: An Azure SQL logical server instance is an implicit resource.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. You need to explicitly deploy a logical server instance. It's not an implicit resource.

      You've been asked to deploy an extension resource with this type: `Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments`.
      Which of these approaches should you consider?
    choices:
    - content: Use the `scope` property on a resource definition.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. In Bicep, you define an extension resource by using the `scope` keyword.
    - content: Use the `parent` property on a resource definition.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. You can define child resources by using the `parent` keyword, but this is not applicable to extension resources.
    - content: Use a nested resource declaration.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. You can define child resources by using a nested resource definition, but you can't define extension resources in this way.
  - content: Which of these statements is true?
    choices:
    - content: Using the `existing` keyword on a resource declaration means that Bicep will redeploy the resource.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. The `existing` keyword means that Bicep will not attempt to deploy the resource. Use the keyword to refer to the resource within your Bicep template.
    - content: All resource definitions in a Bicep file need to have a SKU property set, even existing resources.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. When you define a resource by using the `existing` keyword, you don't specify the SKU property or most other properties.
    - content: You can access the properties of existing resources by using the resource's symbolic name.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. You can use an existing resource to access its properties, including secrets that the resource exposes.
