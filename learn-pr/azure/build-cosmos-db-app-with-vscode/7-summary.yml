  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
 
  - content: "Suppose you are using Visual Studio Code to develop a .NET Core application that accesses Azure Cosmos DB. You need to include the connection string for your database in your application configuration. What is the most convenient way to get this information into your project?"
    choices:
    - content: "Directly from Visual Studio Code"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "The Azure Cosmos DB extension lets you administer and create Azure Cosmos DB accounts and databases from within Visual Studio Code."
    - content: "From the Azure portal"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The Azure portal does provide this information, but if you're already in Visual Studio Code, going to the portal is unlikely to be the most convenient choice."
    - content: "Using the Azure CLI"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "While this is a good choice, especially since Visual Studio Code has a built-in terminal, it does require knowledge of the required commands. This may not be as convenient as the Visual Studio Code extension."
 
  - content: "When working with Azure Cosmos DB's SQL API, which of these can be used to perform CRUD operations?"
    choices:
    - content: "LINQ"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "LINQ and SQL are two of the valid methods for querying when you are using the SQL API."
    - content: "Apache Cassandra client libraries"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Apache Cassandra libraries can work with Azure Cosmos DB’s Cassandra API but not with the SQL API."
    - content: "Azure Table Storage libraries"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Azure Table Storage libraries can work with Azure Cosmos DB's Table API but not with the SQL API."
 
  - content: "When working with the Azure Cosmos DB Client SDK's DocumentClient class, you use a NOSQL model. How would you use this class to change the FirstName field of a Person Document from 'Ann' to 'Fran'?"
    choices:
    - content: "Call UpdateDocumentAsync with FirstName=Fran"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The DocumentClient class doesn't have an UpdateDocumentAsync method. Updating a single field is not consistent with the document-style NOSQL approach."
    - content: "Call UpsertDocumentAsync with an updated Person object"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "While this would work, it isn't the minimum necessary access to meet our requirements. Upsert operations will replace a document if its key already exists or add a new document if not. We don't want to add a new one, so using this method risks introducing subtle, hard to track bugs."
    - content: "Call ReplaceDocumentAsync with an updated Person object"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "ReplaceDocumentAsync will replace the existing document with the new one. In this case we'd intend the old and new to be the same other than FirstName."
