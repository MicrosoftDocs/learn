Imagine that you're building a new system on the cloud, or migrating an existing system to the cloud. How do you instill confidence in your customers that their data is secure? Can your architecture handle a spike in traffic if a media report goes viral? Can your architecture handle the failure of one or more critical components? Are you using resources in the most efficient way?

The Azure Well-Architected Framework will help you to design, build, and continuously improve a secure, reliable, and efficient application. In this module, we'll introduce you to the framework, along with the pillars and principles that are essential to a great Azure architecture.

The concepts discussed in this module are not all-inclusive. They represent some of the important considerations when you're building a solution on the cloud. For more details on the Azure Well-Architected Framework, visit the [Azure Architecture Center](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/framework?azure-portal=true) as you start planning and designing your architecture.
