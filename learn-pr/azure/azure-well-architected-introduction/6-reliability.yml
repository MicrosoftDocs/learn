quiz:
  title: Check your knowledge
  questions: 
  - content: "Suppose you want to increase the availability of your system to provide a better service-level agreement (SLA) to your customers. Which of the following is a guiding principle you can use?"
    choices:
    - content: "Reduce your target for maximum duration of acceptable data loss."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This action can increase recoverability, but not availability."
    - content: "Encrypt all data at rest."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This action can increase security, but not availability."
    - content: "Eliminate single point of failure."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Reliability focuses on maintaining service despite temporary conditions and localized failures. Adding redundancy to eliminate single points of failure is a core strategy for improving availability."
  - content: "Which of the following is affected by your defined recovery point objective (RPO)?"
    choices:
    - content: "The frequency of database backups."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "The recovery point objective (RPO) defines the amount of tolerable data loss. So, the frequency of backups needs to be within this time window, and your defined RPO directly affects it."
    - content: "The number of regions that data is replicated to."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The number of regions that data is replicated to is an important consideration, but your defined RPO doesn't affect it."
    - content: "The number of instances in a database cluster."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The number of instances in a database cluster can be an important decision, but your defined RPO doesn't affect it."
    - content: "The type of load-balancing technology used in your application."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The type of load-balancing technology used in your application can be an important decision, but your defined RPO doesn't affect it."
