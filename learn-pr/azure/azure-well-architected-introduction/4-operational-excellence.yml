  questions:
  - content: "Which of the following is a good example of using testing in your environment?"
    choices:
    - content: "Waiting for users to reach out to you with reports of errors in your application."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This practice is poor and results in a bad user experience."
    - content: "Performing functionality tests in the development environment that are different from functionality tests in the production environment."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "You should perform the same functional tests between environments to ensure you're identifying issues early in your development process rather than in production."
    - content: "Omitting infrastructure deployment from test plans."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Infrastructure deployment should be included in test plans to avoid introducing errors or issues due to misconfigured infrastructure."
    - content: "Performing regular security tests of your application code in development and production environments."

    - content: "Logging on Linux VMs after deployment and installing the software packages that are required for the application."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Post-deployment configuration should be included in an automated build process to reduce error and variance."
    - content: "Using a configuration template to deploy infrastructure in each environment."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "By using a configuration template to deploy infrastructure, you can be sure to have consistent, repeatable environments."
