  questions:
  - content: "Which of the following is an example of scaling up (vertical scaling)?"
    choices:
    - content: "Updating your application to use a queuing service."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Including a queuing service in your application can be a smart architectural decision, but isn't an example of vertical scaling."
    - content: "Adding more web servers into a web farm."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Adding more web servers into a web farm is an example of scaling out (horizontal scaling)."
    - content: "Adding another virtual machine into a database cluster."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Adding another virtual machine into a database cluster isn't an example of vertical scaling."
    - content: "Updating a virtual machine to a larger size."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Changing a virtual machine to a larger size increases the resources available to the instance, and is an example of scaling up (vertical scaling)."
  - content: "Which of the following is an example of scaling out (horizontal scaling)?"
    choices:
    - content: "Updating a virtual machine to a larger size."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Changing a virtual machine to a larger size increases the resources available to the instance, and is an example of scaling up (vertical scaling)."
    - content: "Adding more storage to a virtual machine."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Adding more storage to a virtual machine isn't an example of horizontal scaling."
    - content: "Adding more web servers into a web farm."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Adding more web servers into a web farm is an example of scaling out (horizontal scaling)."
    - content: "Replicating backups to another region"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Replicating backups to another region isn't applicable to scaling of resources."
