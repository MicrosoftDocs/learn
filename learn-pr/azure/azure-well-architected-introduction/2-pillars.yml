  questions:
  - content: What's the primary focus of the Cost Optimization pillar? 
    choices:
    - content: To ensure workload quality through standardized workflows
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. The Operational Excellence pillar emphasizes DevOps practices and standardized workflows to ensure workload quality.
    - content: To evaluate ROI and financial constraints
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. The Cost Optimization pillar focuses on evaluating ROI and financial constraints to help allocate budgets, define spending patterns, and maximize resource investments.
    - content: To enhance workload resiliency and recoverability
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. The Reliability pillar helps ensure that workloads can withstand and recover from failures.
    - content: To improve security by using the CIA Triad and Zero Trust principles
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Incorrect. The Security pillar emphasizes confidentiality, integrity, availability, and Zero Trust principles.
    - content: To optimize your workload's ability to adjust to changes in demand
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Incorrect. The Performance Efficiency pillar helps ensures that workloads can scale efficiently based on demand.
