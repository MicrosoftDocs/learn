Our goal was to help you evaluate whether Azure Logic Apps is a good option to help you implement your business process. We developed some criteria that you can use to guide your decision and remove some guesswork from choosing whether to use Azure Logic Apps:

- Integration
- Performance
- Control
- Connectors

You analyze your business process against each criteria, which help you evaluate your business process in these ways:

- Help you assess how well Azure Logic Apps solves your problem.
- Give you an idea about the amount of required effort.

As a result, this analysis gives you a better idea about how close Azure Logic Apps matches your needs.

When we apply these criteria to our fictional shoe company, we can determine the difficulty in using Azure Logic Apps for each process. Both the *news monitor* and the *video archive utility* tasks use only prebuilt connectors. This characteristic makes them perfect for Azure Logic Apps. The *online sales portal* task requires more work because the process has complex conditionals and needs custom connectors.
