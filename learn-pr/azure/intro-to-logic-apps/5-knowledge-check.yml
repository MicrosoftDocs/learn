  questions:
  - content: "Suppose you work at a financial company. You're building a system for your brokers to trade financial instruments. This system must monitor market conditions, detect changes, execute trades, and quickly handle high transaction volumes. The faster your system can complete trades, the greater the advantage your company has over their competitors.<br><br>Which system requirement would Azure Logic Apps have trouble meeting?"
    choices:
    - content: "High throughput"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Azure Logic Apps automatically scales out resources. A logic app workflow can process large data sets in parallel and handle the throughput required by this system."
    - content: "Fast response time"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Azure Logic Apps doesn't offer low subsecond performance guarantees. This system requires minimal execution time, which is critical for fast transactions."
    - content: "Orchestrate tasks for monitoring markets, detecting changes, and executing trades."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Azure Logic Apps is designed to integrate multiple systems."
  - content: "What's the difference between an _action_ and a _control action_?"
    choices:
    - content: "An action runs a specific task. A control action determines the execution path through your logic app workflow."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Actions and control actions do different things. Actions execute specific tasks. Control actions use conditions (**if** statements), **switch** statements, and loops to determine which actions get to run."
    - content: "An action runs a task in your logic app workflow. A control action launches your logic app workflow."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "A _trigger_ is the component that launches your logic app workflow."
    - content: "An action launches your logic app workflow. Control actions are switch statements."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "A _trigger_ is the component that launches your logic app workflow. Switch statements are one type of control action, not the other way around. Control actions include other kinds of logic statements such as conditions and loops."
  - content: "Suppose you work for a chain of athletic clubs. You want to automate lesson registrations and notifications. You have an in-house, proprietary customer management system to store customer contact information. This system has a REST API, but Azure Logic Apps doesn't have a prebuilt connector for that API.<br><br>Can you still use Azure Logic Apps to automate this process?"
    choices:
    - content: "Azure Logic Apps doesn't have the capability for this scenario, so you should investigate other solutions."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "You can use Azure Logic Apps even when the prebuilt connectors that you need don't exist. However, you have to create your own custom connector for this scenario."
    - content: "Write JavaScript code that you can run from your workflow to interact with your in-house system."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Although Azure Logic Apps has the capability to run JavaScript, C#, and PowerShell plus an editor that lets you edit a workflow's underlying JSON definition. However, the easiest solution is to create a custom connector because the system offers a REST API."
    - content: "Create a custom connector with operations that work with the customer management system and use these operations in your logic app workflow."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Azure Logic Apps is an extensible platform. You can create or use an existing REST API for your proprietary systems and build a custom connector that calls that API."
