  questions:
  - content: "Suppose you work for a financial company. You're building a system to let your brokers trade financial instruments. Your system must monitor market conditions, detect changes, and execute trades. You'll need to handle a large volume of transactions and you'll need to do it quickly. The faster you can complete trades, the more of an advantage you'll have over your competitors. Which requirement of this system would be difficult for Logic Apps to satisfy?"
    choices:
    - content: "High throughput"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Logic Apps scales out automatically. A Logic App can process large data sets in parallel and can handle the throughput required by this system."
    - content: "Response time"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Minimizing execution time is critical in this system. Logic Apps doesn't offer low subsecond performance guarantees."
    - content: "Orchestrate the monitoring, detection, and execution tasks."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Logic Apps is designed to integrate multiple systems."
  - content: "What differentiates an _action_ from a _control action_?"
    choices:
    - content: "An action executes a task, while a control action alters the control flow through your Logic App."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Actions and control actions both contain the word _action_ in their name; however, they do different things. Actions represent tasks. Control actions use **if** statements, **switch** statements, and loops to determine which actions run."
    - content: "An action is a component that executes a task in a Logic App. A control action is a component that launches your Logic App."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The component that launches your app is called a trigger."
    - content: "An action is a component that launches your app, while control actions are switch statements."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Triggers launch your app. Control actions can be switch statements; however, they can also be other types of conditional logic."
  - content: "Suppose you work for a chain of athletic clubs. You want to automate your lesson registrations and notifications. You use a proprietary in-house customer management system to store customer phone numbers and email addresses. The customer management system does have a REST API, but Logic Apps doesn't provide a connector for it. How can you use Logic Apps to automate this process?"
    choices:
    - content: "Use the code view of the Logic Apps Designer to write Javascript code to interact with your proprietary system."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The Designer does offer a code view that lets you edit the underlying JSON definition of your workflow. However, it doesn't support writing executable code in a language like Javascript."
    - content: "Logic apps aren't the correct service to use and you should investigate different solutions."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "You can use Logic Apps even when some services don't have pre-built connectors. It's your job to implement the missing connectors."
    - content: "Create a custom connector for the customer management system and use it in your Logic App."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Logic Apps is an extensible platform. You can create a REST API for your proprietary systems and build a custom connector that invokes that API."
