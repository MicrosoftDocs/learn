      choices:
      - content: "Azure Functions"

      - content: "SQL Server"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "SQL Server wasn't discussed in this unit. SQL Server could be used, since it possesses the same engine, however, it doesn't support the serverless requirement."

        explanation: "WKT is used in Azure Functions, but not to ingest data from IoT devices."
      - content: "CSV"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "CSV isn't the correct format."
    - content: "Which service tier or feature in Azure SQL Database would support a scenario where a 12-TB database is required?"
      choices:
      - content: "Hyperscale"
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "Hyperscale is the correct answer!"
      - content: "Serverless"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "The Serverless tier doesn't support databases of this size."
      - content: "Columnstore indexes"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "This feature is available in SQL Server and Azure SQL, but it doesn't help in supporting a 12-TB database."
