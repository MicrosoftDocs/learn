title: Test your Bicep code by using GitHub Actions
summary: |
  Validate and test your Bicep code in your deployment workflow. You'll use linting, preflight validation, and the what-if operation to validate your Azure changes before you deploy, and you'll test your resources after each deployment.
abstract: |
  After completing this module, you'll be able to:
    - Add Bicep code linting during continuous integration
    - Add preflight deployment validation during build or release jobs
    - Add what-if checks, including manual approval steps
    - Verify the configuration of the deployed environment

  You should be familiar with using:

  - Bicep, including creating and deploying basic files.
  - Azure, including the Azure portal, subscriptions, resource groups, and resources.
