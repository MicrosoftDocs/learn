title: Monitor an Azure Kubernetes Service cluster using Container insights in Azure Monitor
summary: Learn how to analyze the availability and performance of an Azure Kubernetes Service cluster with a containerized application and be proactively notified when a problem occurs. Enable Container insights in Azure Monitor to send the data to a Log Analytics workspace and then workbooks in Azure Monitor to view collected data and enable a predefined alert rule.
abstract: |
  By the end of this module, you'll be able to:
  - Enable Container insights for an AKS cluster.
  - Use Container insights to view health and performance of the components of your AKS cluster.
  - Enable an alert rule to fire when an issue with your cluster is detected.
  - Create and action group to text you when an alert is fired.
prerequisites: |
  -	Access to Azure account with an active subscription.
  -	Knowledge of what Azure Monitor is and how it works at a beginner level.
  -	Basic knowledge of Kubernetes and its concepts.
  -	A deployed Azure Kubernetes Service cluster with a containerized application. If you donâ€™t already have an AKS cluster to monitor, then complete the Learn module [Deploy a containerized application on Azure Kubernetes Service](../aks-deploy-container-app/index.yml). The AKS cluster created in that module will be used for this lesson, but you can apply the same steps to your own cluster.
