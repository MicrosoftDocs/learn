  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
    - content: "What is horizontal scaling?"
      choices:
        - content: "When the application is replicated in order to sustain a heavier load."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct. When you scale an application horizontally, you're duplicating and balancing the load among several copies of it."
        - content: "Adding more RAM to the VM."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Adding more resources is not a part of horizontal scaling."
        - content: "Rendering the application stateless so it can be used without a persistent storage."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Stateless applications are easier to scale than stateful ones, however this is not the definition of horizontal scaling."
    - content: "Why is it important to have a resource request set on pods bound to an HPA?"
      choices:
        - content: "Because this is the only way to calculate the resource utilization."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct. The HPA algorithm uses the resource requests to calculate the utilization."
        - content: "It's not important, but it's recommended so the application don't starve."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Although it's important to have resources set for this reason, HPAs cannot calculate the resource usage if the resource keys are not set."
        - content: "So the HPA knows when to stop scaling a resource based on the resources available in the cluster."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "HPAs will not mind the total amount of resources in a cluster."
    - content: "Why is vertical scaling less recommended for stateless applications?"
      choices:
        - content: "Because vertical scaling duplicates the applications and this is harder on stateless apps."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Vertical scaling does not duplicate applications."
        - content: "Because it requires a stateful application to be vertically scaled."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Any application can be vertically scaled."
        - content: "Because it's cheaper to duplicate an stateless application then increase the resources on its VM."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct. While a stateless application can be vertically scaled, the cost of adding more resources to a VM surpasses the cost of duplicating the same VM."
