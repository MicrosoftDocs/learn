## Verify the web API application is running ##

1. Let's ensure your web API app is properly deployed. Open your web browser and enter the website URL you copied from the previous step. A **Page Not Found** error, like the one in the following image, is expected.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/5-exercise-publish-web-api-to-azure-app-service-11.png" alt-text="Page Not Found.":::
