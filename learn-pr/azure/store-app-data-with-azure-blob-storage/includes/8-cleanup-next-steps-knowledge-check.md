In this module, you learned how to use Azure Blob storage to store web application data. We discussed tips for creating a strategy to use Blob storage in a web app and how to use the Azure Storage SDK for .NET Core to write to and read from blobs. The app we made accepts uploaded files from users, stores them in Blob storage, and makes them available for download.

To clean up your Cloud Shell storage, delete the `mslearn-store-data-in-azure` directory.

- **Securely storing secrets like connection strings**: The most robust end-to-end solution for storing secret configuration values is Azure Key Vault. See [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/security/key-vault-configuration?view=aspnetcore-2.1&tabs=aspnetcore2x) for information about using Key Vault in an ASP.NET Core application. Alternatively, you can safely store connection strings in App Service application settings and use the [ASP.NET Core Secret Manager tool](https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/security/app-secrets?view=aspnetcore-2.1&tabs=windows) to support developer environments.
