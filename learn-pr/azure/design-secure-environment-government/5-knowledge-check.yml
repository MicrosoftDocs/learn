  questions:
  - content: "What is a benefit of multi-tenant cloud computing?"
    choices:
    - content: "The multi-tenant cloud allows customers to access each other’s applications."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect: Azure uses logical isolation to segregate each customer's applications and data. This approach provides the scale and economic benefits of multi-tenant cloud services while preventing customers from accessing one another's data or applications."
    - content: "Hyperscale public cloud also offers many features that incorporate the latest cloud innovations."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct: Features, such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, IoT services, and intelligent edge, help government customers increase efficiency and unlock insights into their operations and performance."
    - content: "Applications and data are stored in multiple physical hardware components."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect: Multiple customer’s applications and data are stored on the same physical hardware."
    - content: "All data is stored on Azure cloud services."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect: Azure Stack Hub and Azure Stack Edge allow customers to process highly sensitive data using a private or hybrid cloud."
  - content: "What technology allows Azure to support private and hybrid cloud deployment models?"
    choices:
    - content: "Azure confidential computing."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Azure confidential computing offers encryption of data while it’s in use, ensuring that data is always under customer control."
    - content: "Just-in-time (JIT) virtual machine (VM) access."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect: Just-in-time (JIT) virtual machine (VM) access can be used to lock down inbound traffic to Azure VMs by creating network security group (NSG) rules."
    - content: "Customer Lockbox."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect: Customer Lockbox for Azure allows customers to approve/deny elevated access requests for customer data in support scenarios."
    - content: "Azure Stack Hub."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct:  Azure Stack Hub enables customers to run workloads using the same architecture and APIs as in Azure while having a physically isolated network for their highest classification data."
  - content: "Which technology allows customers to approve/deny elevated access requests for customer data in support scenarios?"
    choices:
    - content: "Tactical Azure Stack Hub."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect: Tactical Azure Stack Hub is used for tactical edge deployments for limited or no connectivity, fully mobile requirements, harsh conditions requiring military specification solutions, and so on."
    - content: "Intel Software Guard Extensions."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect: Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGX) technology provides encrypted code and data to help ensure customer control."
    - content: "Azure Dedicated Host."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect: Azure Dedicated Host provides physical servers that can host one or more Azure VMs and are dedicated to one Azure subscription. Customers can provision dedicated hosts within a region, availability zone, and fault domain."
    - content: "Customer Lockbox."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct: Customer Lockbox for Azure allows customers to approve/deny elevated access requests for customer data in support scenarios. It’s an extension of the Just-in-Time (JIT) workflow that comes with full audit logging enabled."
