  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: 'Which of the following might be a way to improve performance of an application on an N-tier architecture, while keeping costs optimized?'
    choices:
    - content: Deploy larger virtual machines to each tier.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: While increasing the size of virtual machines may improve performance, it doesn't minimize costs. As the load drops, the virtual machines remain the same size and your costs don't decrease.
    - content: 'Use autoscaling to handle fluctuations in load.'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Autoscaling is a good way to minimize your costs. As load increases or decreases, your compute resources can adjust with it, ensuring your costs are optimized to your load.
    - content: Place your application behind a load balancer.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Placing an application behind a load balancer alone doesn't have a direct effect on performance or costs.

  - content: 'Which of the following actions would improve the security of an application?'
    choices:
    - content: Restrict access to your data tier from the internet.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Isolating access to your data tier is a recommended way to improve the security of your application.
    - content: Allow remote administration of your application tier servers from the internet.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Opening up access to the internet for remote administration isn't recommended. It increases the ability for malicious activity against your systems.
    - content: Add a caching technology between your application and data tiers.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Adding a caching technology to your application can help improve performance, but doesn't have a direct effect on the security of your application.
