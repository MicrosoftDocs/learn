    - content: Application tier

      explanation: The data tier focuses on the storage of data. This tier of the application isn't the best place to add integration with an API.

    choices:
    - content: Presentation tier
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: This tier handles the interaction with the end user, and should be the tier accessed by the end user.
    - content: Application tier
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: This tier contains business logic, data processing, and other potentially sensitive details. You shouldn't expose this tier to end users.

      isCorrect: false
      explanation: The data tier handles the storage of data. You should never expose the data tier directly to users. Consumers of data should use capabilities provided by higher tiers.
