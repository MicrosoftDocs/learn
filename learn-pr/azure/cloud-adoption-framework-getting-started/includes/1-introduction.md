The Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework (CAF) for the Azure Learn modules will teach you how to apply the various guidance, tools, best practices, and reference architectures found within each CAF methodology. This module serves as an accelerator, helping you accelerate and unblock adoption in parallel to your learning paths.

In this module, you will review the narrative that spans the majority of the Learn modules in this learning path. You will also see how a range of CAF getting started resources can accelerate results across your cloud adoption efforts.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you will:

- Understand common roadblocks that prevent adoption success.
- Evaluate one or more guides that can help you get things moving or moving faster.
- Get started on the proper course of action using shared guidance and related Learn modules.

## Prerequisites

Before applying the CAF Learn modules, you should have a general understanding of your current cloud adoption plan and understand the roadblocks that might be preventing your organization from being successful.

As an alternative, a narrative and cloud adoption plan will be provided for a reference customer named Tailwind Traders.
