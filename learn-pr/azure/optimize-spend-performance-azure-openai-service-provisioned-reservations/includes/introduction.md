Microsoft Azure OpenAI services include provisioned deployments, also known as provisioned throughput units (PTUs), that allows you to specify the amount of throughput you require in your AI deployment. You can use PTUs to deploy any Azure AI model as per your requirements.

## Example scenario

Contoso Retail, a mid-sized retail company, wants to enhance customer support by implementing an AI-powered chatbot that can manage common customer inquiries, provide product recommendations, and assist with order tracking. Contoso Retail wants to design its chatbot to be highly available, have low latency, and provide predictable performance while managing costs effectively. For these reasons, they've decided to use Azure OpenAI as the core engine for their chatbot. You work as an Azure administrator for Contoso Retail. You've been tasked to recommend an appropriate solution to allocate resources for chatbot deployment in Azure OpenAI.

## What will we learn?

In this module, you'll learn how to efficiently allocate and use resources needed for Azure OpenAI Service deployment. You'll review the various Azure OpenAI deployment models and understand how to request and deploy PTUs. You'll also learn how to select and purchase the appropriate Azure OpenAI Service provisioned reservation based on your organization's requirements. Finally, you'll examine how to manage and monitor the provisioned reservations.

## What is the main goal?

By the end of this module, you'll be able to design and use the Azure OpenAI Service with PTUs. You'll be able to identify the appropriate Azure OpenAI Provisioned reservation for your organization, and understand the procedures for deploying, monitoring, and managing the provisioned reservations.
