quiz:
  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: The high-performance computing (HPC) application runs correctly on 64 HB120_v2. Should you still run some health checks?
    choices:
    - content: There's no need. The application is running correctly.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: This answer is incorrect. Even though the HPC application runs correctly on 64 VMs and produces the correct output that doesn't mean it's running optimally. A single unhealthy virtual machine (VM) can have a significant impact on parallel performance.
    - content: I should run health checks only after every third deployment.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: This answer is incorrect. There's no guarantee that each deployment lands on the same physical hardware. You should always run health checks after every deployment.
    - content: Yes, I should still run some health checks.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. You should always run health checks before running any HPC application, especially large and tightly coupled HPC applications.
  - content: What is the recommended tool to check the health of the InfiniBand interconnect?
    choices:
    - content: Intel IMB-IMP1 PingPong built with HPC-X.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. Intel IMB-MPI1 built with HPC-X is preloaded on a CentOS HPC 7.7+ Azure Marketplace image and provides the best performance.
    - content: Intel IMB-IMPI1 PingPong contained in the Intel MPI environment on a CentOS HPC 7.7+ Azure Marketplace image.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: This answer is incorrect. This version of IMB-IMP1 would work and measure InfiniBand latency/bandwidth, but other versions measure more accurate and optimal InfiniBand latency/bandwidth.
    - content: HPL built with HPC-X.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: This answer is incorrect. The HPL benchmark is primarily used to measure the maximum FLOPS. It also indirectly tests the InfiniBand network, but other tests/tools would be better options.
  - content: What is the recommended tool to check the health of the VM's memory?
    choices:
    - content: IOR benchmark tool.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: This answer is incorrect. The IOR benchmark tool is used to benchmark synthetic I/O patterns, not memory bandwidth.
    - content: Intel IMP-IMP1 PingPong.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: This answer is incorrect. Intel IMP-IMP1 PingPong is used to measure network latency/bandwidth, not VM memory bandwidth.
    - content: Intel MLC.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. Intel Memory Latency Checker is a useful tool to benchmark the maximum memory bandwidth and determine the health of the VM memory.
