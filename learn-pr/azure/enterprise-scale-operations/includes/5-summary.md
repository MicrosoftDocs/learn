Operationalizing the Azure estate is critical. It ensures that the organization maintains full visibility and control over the platform. It also provides the business with a secure, unhindered path to the cloud.

For central teams to maintain operational visibility within a large-scale Azure estate, organizations must establish a centralized approach to management and monitoring. We recommend that organizations enforce management and monitoring configurations across the Azure estate. This approach:

- Ensures that there are no unintended gaps in observability.
- Provides application teams with easily consumable management capabilities.
- Gives central teams the ability to enforce controls that are necessary to meet governance and compliance requirements.

To provide a platform that meets application requirements for high availability (HA) and disaster recovery (DR), you must have a thorough understanding of the mechanisms that application teams use to achieve their goals. The platform team is responsible for connectivity and for guiding region selection for platform-replication capabilities.

A secure Azure estate provides central teams with real-time visibility into changes in the environment. This visibility is critical to meeting governance and compliance requirements. To achieve this goal, use Microsoft Defender for Cloud and Microsoft Sentinel for real-time insights, and use Azure Policy to enforce approved resource configurations.
