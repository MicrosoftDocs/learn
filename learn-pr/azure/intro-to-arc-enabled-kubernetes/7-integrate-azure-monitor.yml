  questions:
  - content: "What component implements Azure Monitor container insights?"
    choices:
    - content: "Azure Monitor Agent"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Container insights rely on a containerized version of the Log Analytics agent for Linux that runs in the monitored cluster."
    - content: "Flux"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Flux configures GitOps for Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes, and isn't used directly to implement container insights."
    - content: "OMSAgent"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The legacy OMSAgent name has changed to Azure Monitor Agent. Queries, rules, and scripts that referred to `omsagent` should now refer to `ama-logs`."
    - content: "CoreDNS"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "CoreDNS provides name resolution in Kubernetes clusters, and isn't used directly to implement container insights."
  - content: "What Azure resource do you have to provision before you can implement Azure Monitor container insights?"
    choices:
    - content: "Azure Automation account"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Container insights don't require an Automation account."
    - content: "Azure Key Vault"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Container insights don't require Key Vault."
    - content: "Azure Storage account"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Container insights don't require a storage account."
    - content: "Log Analytics workspace"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "A Log Analytics workspace is a prerequisite, because Kubernetes cluster telemetry resides in this workspace."
