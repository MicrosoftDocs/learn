quiz:
  questions:
  - content: "With Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes, how is the connection from the cluster to Azure maintained?"
    choices:
    - content: "The cluster must be created within an Azure virtual machine."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The Azure Arc agents deployed to the cluster enable the connection, regardless of where the cluster exists."
    - content: "Agents deployed in the cluster maintain a connection to Azure."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "After Azure Arc agents are deployed, they synchronize cluster state and metadata between the cluster and Azure."
    - content: "Status is updated manually in the Azure portal."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The Azure Arc agents maintain the connection. No manual updates are required."
  - content: "Which of these is required to connect a Kubernetes cluster to Azure Arc?"
    choices:
    - content: "Multiple Azure subscriptions."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Only one Azure subscription is needed to connect a Kubernetes cluster to Azure Arc."
    - content: "Outbound connectivity from the Kubernetes cluster."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "To connect a Kubernetes cluster to Azure Arc, the cluster must be able to connect to Azure and other required endpoints."
    - content: "An Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) user account with the **Owner** role."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The user account must have at least the **Kubernetes Cluster - Azure Arc Onboarding** role. The **Owner** role is not required."
  - content: "What type of deployment agent does Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes use for GitOps?"
    choices:
    - content: "Istio"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Istio is an open-source service mesh platform. It's not used to implement GitOps for Arc-enabled Kubernetes."
    - content: "omsagent"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The omsagent agent implements Azure Monitor functionality on Kubernetes clusters. It's not used to implement GitOps for Arc-enabled Kubernetes."
    - content: "Flux"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes clusters rely on Flux, an open-source GitOps deployment tool."
