Containerization is an important technology trend across public and private clouds and in on-premises datacenters. Running containers at scale requires an orchestrator such as Kubernetes, which automates container scheduling, deployment, networking, scaling, health monitoring, and management.

Many vendors support Kubernetes as a standard for containerized deployments. Microsoft provides Azure Arc as a consistent, scalable management model for Kubernetes clusters and their workloads across hybrid and multicloud deployments.

Imagine that you're a systems engineer for Contoso, a medium-size financial services company with headquarters in London and offices in New York and San Francisco. Contoso's computing environment is hosted in its on-premises datacenters. Most Contoso workloads are fully containerized on Kubernetes, running on a third-party virtualization platform.

Despite its modernized environment, Contoso faces challenges imposed by capacity and agility constraints inherent in on-premises infrastructures. It's also becoming harder to consistently manage a continually growing number of Kubernetes clusters.

To address these capacity and agility challenges, IT management has decided to migrate many of Contoso's containerized workloads to the cloud. Contoso wants to use multiple cloud providers to avoid single-vendor dependency, but has chosen Azure as its main deployment target. This choice is due to the advantages of Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) and the benefits of Azure Arc, especially its centralized, multiplatform management capabilities.

Your engineering team is tasked with exploring and evaluating Azure Arc capabilities for Kubernetes-based workloads. You must determine how Contoso can benefit from the Azure Arc hybrid management model and pursue a multivendor strategy while maintaining some on-premises containerized workloads.

In this module, you learn how Azure Arc helps with Kubernetes cluster management and monitoring. You can then implement these capabilities at Contoso to help optimize and simplify its operations.

## Learning objectives

After you complete this module, you know how to:

- Explain Kubernetes, Azure Arc, and Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes.
- Connect Kubernetes clusters to Azure Arc.
- Use GitOps to apply configurations to Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes clusters.
- Integrate Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes clusters with Azure Monitor and Azure Policy.

## Prerequisites

For the best learning experience from this module, you need basic understanding and familiarity with:

- Containerization and Kubernetes architecture.
- Azure portal and Azure CLI interfaces.
- Azure Monitor and Azure Policy.
- GitOps principles and processes.

Some procedures in later units list specific prerequisites.
