  questions:
  - content: How does Azure Lighthouse let a service provider access resources in a customer's Azure environment?
    choices:
    - content: Customers create a user account for the service provider in their Azure tenant.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. Service providers don't need accounts in the customer's Azure tenant.
    - content: The customer tenant becomes completely managed by the service provider.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. Azure Lighthouse grants specific access to a service provider, but doesn't give them control of an entire customer tenant.
    - content: Users in the service provider's tenant are granted specific roles to delegated resources in the customer's tenant.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. After the onboarding process, service providers can sign in to their own Azure tenant and access the customer resources to which they've been granted access.
  - content: What is the most efficient way that Azure Lighthouse could help Contoso ensure that all of its customer's storage accounts use HTTPS?
    choices:
    - content: Contoso can access individual storage accounts in each customer tenant and check that each of them are using HTTPS.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. While Azure Lighthouse enables this access, it's more efficient to deploy a policy across all customers.
    - content: Contoso can create a policy to check that storage accounts use HTTPS. It can then deploy that one policy across all of the customer subscriptions that it manages through Azure Lighthouse.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. With Azure Lighthouse, one policy can be deployed to all of Contoso's customers.
    - content: Contoso can create custom policies for each customer to check that storage accounts use HTTPS, then deploy the policies to each individual subscription that it manages through Azure Lighthouse.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. It's more efficient for Contoso to deploy one policy across all of its customers, which is supported by Azure Lighthouse.
  - content: What are the costs for using Azure Lighthouse?
    choices:
    - content: Free
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. It's free, as long as you have an existing Azure subscription.
    - content: Costs are based on the number of onboarded customers.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. Azure Lighthouse is free to use, as long as you have an existing Azure subscription.
    - content: Costs are based on the number of marketplace offers and Azure Resource Manager Templates used.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. Azure Lighthouse is free to use, as long as you have an existing Azure subscription.
