  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: One of the R&D team's simulation codes runs on &lt; four processes per node and is highly optimized for AVX 512. Which Azure HPC SKU should the team choose?
    choices:
    - content: HB120_v2
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: HB120_v2 does not support AVX 512.
    - content: HC44
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: HC44 is the only HPC SKU to support AVX 512.
    - content: HB60
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: HB60 does not support AVX 512
  - content: Another tightly coupled HPC application is memory bandwidth bound, but not floating-point intensive, and typically runs on &lt; 40 processes per VM. Which Azure HPC SKU should the team choose?
    choices:
    - content: HB120_v2
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: HB120_v2 isn't the most cost effective option for this type of HPC application.
    - content: HC44
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: HC44 isn't the most cost effective option for this type of HPC application, and its memory bandwidth isn't as good as other options.
    - content: HB60
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: HB60 is the most cost effective option for this type of HPC application.
  - content: The R&D team's final tightly coupled HPC application is floating-point and memory bandwidth bound, and has good parallel scaling. Which Azure HPC SKU should the team choose?
    choices:
    - content: HB120_v2
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: HB120_v2 has the best floating-point, memory bandwidth, and network performance. It's a good choice for this HPC application.
    - content: HC44
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: HC44 does not have sufficient memory bandwidth or floating-point performance. Other HPC SKUs are a better option.
    - content: HB60
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: HB60 does not have sufficient floating-point and parallel scaling performance for this HPC application.
