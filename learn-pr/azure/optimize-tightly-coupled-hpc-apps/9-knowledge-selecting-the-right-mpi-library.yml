  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: Which MPI libraries will work on the HB120_v2, HB60, and HC44 VMs? 
    choices:
    - content: Only Intel MPI, because Azure only supports the DAPL infiniBand API.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: HB120_v2, HB60 and HC44 support virtualization of PCIe vi SR-IOV so all MPI libraries will work and not just Intel MPI.
    - content: Mellanox tuned HPCX MPI library
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: HB120_v2, HB60 and HC44 support virtualization of PCIe vi SR-IOV so all MPI libraries will work and not just HPCX.
    - content: All popular MPI libraries
      isCorrect: true
      explanation:  HB120_v2, HB60 and HC44 support SR-IOV and so all MPI libraries that work on premises with infiniBand will also work on these HPC VMs.
  - content: Which MPI library is recommended on HB120, HB60, and HC44? 
    choices:
    - content: Intel MPI 2019 update5+
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Intel MPI 2019 update5+ now supports the mlx provider, UCX and HCOLL, but there is a better option.
    - content: HPCX MPI library
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: yes, HPCX is recommended because it is tuned for the Azure hardware and takes advantages of all the communication performance optimizations.
    - content: Any MPI library on the CentOS-HPC 7.8+ Marketplace image, they all have the same performance.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: All MPI libraries do not have the same performance and the performance differences may depend on the communication pattern.
  - content: Which MPI library is ABI compatible with mpich library? 
    choices:
    - content: Intel MPI
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Yes, Intel MPI is ABI compatible with mpich, so you could build with mpich and run the resulting HPC application with Intel MPI.
    - content: HPCX MPI library
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: No, HPCX is ABI compatible with OpenMPI and not mpich.
    - content: All MPI libraries are ABI compatible
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: No, all MPI libraries are API compatible if they follow the MPI standards, but they all are not ABI compatible.
