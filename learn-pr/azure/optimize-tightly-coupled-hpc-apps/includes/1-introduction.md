Suppose you're a member of a car-manufacturing R&D team tasked with designing and developing a new flagship sports car. This project requires running several tightly coupled, high-performance computing (HPC) applications. Each of these applications has different performance characteristics. Management wants your team to complete this project in a timely and cost-effective manner, so your job is to determine the most efficient and economical way of building and running your applications in Azure.

In this module, you learn some key optimization principles that help you ensure that your HPC application runs efficiently from both a virtual machine (VM) and HPC software perspective. The following video describes several HPC technologies, which help you make an informed decision when considering how best to optimize your application.

## Learning objectives

After you complete this module, you'll be able to:

- Choose the best, cost-performant HPC SKU for each type of tightly coupled HPC application.
- Optimally build and run each type of tightly coupled HPC application on Azure HPC SKUs.

## Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of high-performance computing.
- Familiarity with Azure Virtual Machines tasks, such as deploying virtual machines and mounting shared file systems.
- You need the Azure CLI to complete the exercise in this module. If you don't have the Azure CLI installed, see [Control Azure services with the CLI](/training/modules/control-azure-services-with-cli/).
