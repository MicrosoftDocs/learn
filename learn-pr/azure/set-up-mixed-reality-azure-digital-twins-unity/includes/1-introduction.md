Microsoft Mixed Reality enables developers to create unique and immersive experiences. Connecting users to data, processes, and actions designed for HoloLens 2 and VR.

## Example scenario

For this learning path, you'll be working on a simulated industry scenario for a windmill farm by pulling in real-time turbine data using the Azure Digital Twins service. The end goal is to give you a foundation in practical ways of visualizing and experiencing data in a mixed reality environment.

## What will we be doing?

In this module, you'll be introduced to the basic concepts and technologies used in this learning path:

* Mixed Reality
* Azure Digital Twins
* Azure SignalR
* Unity  

You'll also be guided through getting started with Azure subscriptions and accounts, and how to set up a Unity project and development environment.

## What is the main goal?

By the end of this module, you'll be able to define Mixed Reality, create an Azure Digital Twins account, and set up a Unity project. You'll also have context on applying the learnings from this module to a real-world industry use case, and on the role Azure SignalR services play in getting real-time web functionality.
