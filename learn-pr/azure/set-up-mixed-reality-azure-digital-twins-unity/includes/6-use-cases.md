Throughout the *Build Mixed Reality Digital Twins with Azure Digital Twins and Unity* learning path, you'll work with fictional assets and simulated operational data based on a wind farm. The telemetry data, although realistic, isn't real and isn't representative of actual wind farm performance; it's been simulated for educational purposes. Your mixed-reality application will focus on operating a fictional wind farm, using Microsoft and Unity technologies to create a functioning Digital Twin.

In this learning path, you'll create an application for mixed reality to receive data from an Azure Digital Twins (ADT) instance of a wind turbine, complete with operational sensor data.  You'll illustrate the value of connecting sensor data to your wind turbine Digital Twins in an immersive, data-rich experience. The mixed-reality experience will let you visualize, monitor, and act on operation conditions on a wind power generating facility. Specifically, you'll use Azure services to monitor the operational state of a set of wind turbines, observing power, ambient temperature, and simulated events.
