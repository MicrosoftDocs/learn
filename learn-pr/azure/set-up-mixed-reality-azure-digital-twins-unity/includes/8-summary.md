In this module, you learned about some of the foundational technology used to create digital twins of wind farms. Connecting operation IoT data to a digital representation of wind turbines using Azure Digital Twins and Unity, you saw how the creation of a Digital Twins Mixed Reality experience can create an immersive experience for operators. You learned how a Digital Twins becomes a powerful tool to interact with real-time or right-time data using Azure SignalR.
