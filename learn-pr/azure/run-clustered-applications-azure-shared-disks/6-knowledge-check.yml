  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
 
  - content: "An administrator plans to use an Azure shared disk for a clustered database. Which one of the following SQL deployment options can benefit from Azure shared disks?"
    choices:
    - content: "A single instance SQL"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Single instance SQL is deployed on only one virtual machine (VM) and doesn't require Azure shared disk."
    - content: "An Always On availability group"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "An Always On availability group provides high availability SQL deployment, but it doesn't use Azure shared disks."
    - content: "A SQL Server failover cluster instance (FCI)"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "A SQL Server FCI takes advantage of failover cluster scenarios, where multiple virtual machines (VMs) access and use an Azure shared disk."
 
  - content: "Which one of the following statements is true about Azure shared disks?"
    choices:
    - content: "Shared managed disks offer a fully managed file system that can be accessed by using SMB/NFS."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Shared managed disks don't natively offer a fully managed file system that can be accessed by using SMB/NFS. You need to use a cluster manager, such as Windows Server Failover Cluster (WSFC) or Pacemaker, that handles cluster node communication and write locking."
    - content: "I can use a shared disk as an OS Disk."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "You can use Azure shared disks only as data disks."
    - content: "You can use SCSI PR commands to enable failover from one node to another when you use Azure shared disks."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Azure shared disks support SCSI PR standards. After you mount the shared disk to the virtual machines (VMs) in your cluster, you can establish a quorum and read/write access to the disk by using SCSI PR."
 
  - content: "An administrator plans to create an Azure Virtual Machine (VM) that will use an Azure shared disk. Which one of the following disk types can use the shared disk functionality?"
    choices:
    - content: "Data disk"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Azure shared disks can be shared only as data disks."
    - content: "OS disk"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Azure shared disks can be shared only as data disks."
    - content: "Temporary disk"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Azure shared disks can be shared only as data disks."
