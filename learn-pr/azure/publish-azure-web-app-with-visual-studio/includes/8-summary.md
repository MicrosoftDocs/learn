In this module, you created a new ASP.NET web app from scratch, then published it to Azure directly from Visual Studio. You created an App Service app, updated the app, and published changes. All this was completed from within Visual Studio.

Visual Studio and Azure App Service provide a powerful mechanism for creating, publishing, and maintaining web apps in Azure. With this combination of simplicity and manageability, keeping web apps up to date in Azure becomes a simple process.
