## Example scenario

Imagine you work for an online retailer that runs a Java-based website on Red Hat hosted in an on-premises datacenter. The system takes months to scale and presents many hoops that developers must jump through in order to build, test, and push changes to production.

Your manager wants to modernize the system to respond to the global shift of online ordering, which requires finding a way to help developers build new capabilities for the website faster and improve its speed, availability, and scalability.

You recommend migrating the system to the cloud, running the core application on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) on Azure, modernizing the Java with JBoss Enterprise Application Platform (JBoss EAP), and containerizing components of the application using Azure Red Hat OpenShift (ARO).

## Learning objectives

By the end of this module, you'll be able to:

- Discuss how Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), Azure Red Hat OpenShift (ARO), and JBoss EAP in Azure work.
- Determine if Red Hat on Azure solutions are right for modernizing and scaling your Linux-based workloads in the cloud.
