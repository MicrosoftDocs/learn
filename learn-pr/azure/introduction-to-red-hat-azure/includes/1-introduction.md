Red Hat offers open-source code for enterprise customers to improve the manageability, reliability, and security of their Linux workloads. It’s available on Azure through three main product offerings; Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), Azure Red Hat OpenShift (ARO), and JBoss EAP on Azure.

## Example scenario

Suppose you work in IT for an online retailer that runs a Java-based website on Red Hat hosted in an on-premises datacenter. This system takes months to scale and presents many hoops that developers must jump through in order to build, test, and push changes to production.

Your manager wants to be able to better respond to the global shift to online ordering, which requires finding a way to:

1. Help developers build new capabilities for the website faster.
1. Improve customer experience through increased speed, availability, and scale.

You recommend migrating the system to the cloud by running the core application on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) on Azure. Modernizing the Java with JBoss Enterprise Application Platform (JBoss EAP), and containerizing components of the application Azure Red Hat OpenShift (ARO) for faster development and scaling.

## What will we be doing?

Here, we will:

- Discuss how Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) works.
- Discuss how Azure Red Hat OpenShift (ARO) works.
- Discuss how JBoss EAP in Azure works.

## What is the main goal?

By the end of this module, you're able to determine if Red Hat on Azure solutions—RHEL, ARO, and JBoss—are right for modernizing and scaling your Linux-based workloads in the cloud.
