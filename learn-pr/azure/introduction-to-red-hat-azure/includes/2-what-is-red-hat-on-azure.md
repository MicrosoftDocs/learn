Red Hat offers open-source code for enterprise customers to improve the manageability, reliability, and security of their Linux workloads. Azure offers the following Red Hat products: Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), Azure Red Hat OpenShift (ARO), and JBoss EAP on Azure.

## Red Hat on Azure solutions

### RHEL

**Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)** is an open-source Linux operating system that serves as the consistent foundation for the enterprise hybrid cloud and provides the tools needed to deliver services and workloads faster with less effort. Using RHEL as the operating system for your Azure virtual machines (VMs) provides you with tightly integrated, enterprise-grade support from Red Hat and Microsoft. This support ensures a seamless transition to running your workloads in a cloud environment.

### ARO

**Azure Red Hat OpenShift (ARO)** provides fully managed Red Hat OpenShift clusters on Azure. Both Microsoft and Red Hat engineers manage and support these clusters. ARO applies the power of Azure to provide a flexible, self-service deployment of fully managed OpenShift clusters for developing and deploying applications. With ARO, you can maintain regulatory compliance and focus on your application development, while Microsoft and Red Hat patch, update, and monitor your cluster nodes. You can get up and running immediately using the pre-integrated application builds, container packaging and registry, deployments, scaling, health management, and more. ARO also supports integration with most major CI/CD and application performance management solutions. 

ARO is explained in more detail in the next unit.

### JBoss EAP

**Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform (EAP)** is the middleware solution that makes it easier to modernize, containerize, and migrate your Java applications to Azure. You can use JBoss EAP with RHEL, ARO, or the JBoss plan offered in Azure App Services.

JBoss EAP offers a comprehensive, feature-rich solution for Java applications. It allows for deployment across all different types of infrastructures, including VM-based and container-based infrastructures and cloud native offerings like Azure App Services.

In each of these scenarios, JBoss EAP provides the certified Java base with security and data handling extensions to ensure your workloads comply with the latest regulations and privacy standards. JBoss EAP can integrate with existing SSO solutions and other various solutions that are required to operate within the suite of enterprise applications.

## Why run Red Hat on Azure?

There are many benefits to running Red Hat on Azure, including:

- No-hassle, unified global support across 18 regions with a coordinated escalation and resolution process and integrated ticketing.
- Your choice to create your own VM or select from hundreds of pre-provisioned VM images through Azure Marketplace.
- Simplified administration and security controls for managing across a complex hybrid infrastructure.
- Up-to-date Red Hat infrastructure on Azure by default and support for previous versions through Extended Lifecycle Support.
