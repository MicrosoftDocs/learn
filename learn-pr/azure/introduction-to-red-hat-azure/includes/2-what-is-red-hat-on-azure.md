Red Hat offers open-source code for enterprise customers to improve the manageability, reliability, and security of their Linux workloads. Azure offers the following Red Hat products: Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), Azure Red Hat OpenShift (ARO), and JBoss EAP on Azure.

## Red Hat on Azure solutions

### RHEL

**Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)** is an open-source Linux operating system that serves as the consistent foundation for the enterprise hybrid cloud and provides the tools needed to deliver services and workloads faster with less effort. Using RHEL as the operating system for your Azure virtual machines (VMs) provides you with tightly integrated, enterprise-grade support from Red Hat and Microsoft. This support ensures a seamless transition to running your workloads in a cloud environment.

### ARO

**Azure Red Hat OpenShift (ARO)** provides fully managed Red Hat OpenShift clusters on Azure. Both Microsoft and Red Hat engineer, manage, and support these clusters. ARO applies the power of Azure to provide a flexible, self-service deployment of fully managed OpenShift clusters for developing and deploying applications. With ARO, you can maintain regulatory compliance and focus on your application development, while Microsoft and Red Hat patch, update, and monitor your cluster nodes. You can get up and running immediately using the pre-integrated application builds, container packaging and registry, deployments, scaling, health management, and more. ARO also supports integration with most major CI/CD and application performance management solutions.

### JBoss EAP

**Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform (EAP)** is the middleware solution that makes it easier to modernize, containerize, and migrate your Java applications to Azure. You can use JBoss EAP with RHEL, ARO, or the JBoss plan offered in Azure App Services.

JBoss EAP offers a comprehensive, feature-rich solution for Java applications. It allows for deployment across all different types of infrastructures, including VM-based and container-based infrastructures and cloud native offerings like Azure App Services.

In each of these scenarios, JBoss EAP provides the certified Java base with security and data handling extensions to ensure your workloads comply with the latest regulations and privacy standards. JBoss EAP can integrate with existing SSO solutions and other various solutions that are required to operate within the suite of enterprise applications.

## Why run Red Hat on Azure?

There are many benefits to running Red Hat on Azure, including:

- No-hassle, unified global support across 18 regions with a coordinated escalation and resolution process and integrated ticketing.
- Your choice to create your own VM or select from hundreds of pre-provisioned VM images through Azure Marketplace.
- Simplified administration and security controls for managing across a complex hybrid infrastructure.
- Up-to-date Red Hat infrastructure on Azure by default and support for previous versions through Extended Lifecycle Support.

## Licensing options for Red Hat on Azure

You can choose to **Pay-As-You-Go (PAYG)** or use the Red Hat Cloud Access Program to **Bring-Your-Own-Software (BYOS)**.

With PAYG, you purchase images from Microsoft Azure at flat, hourly rates that include infrastructure and software usage rights. You pay for compute capacity by the second, with no long-term commitment or upfront payments. You can increase or decrease compute capacity on demand. These instances don't consume Red Hat Subscriptions, and they shouldn't be registered with Red Hat Subscription Management or Red Hat Satellite.

The Red Hat Cloud Access program makes your eligible Red Hat product subscriptions portable, allowing you to choose the best architecture and infrastructure for your needs. The terms of your subscription with Red Hat, including pricing, remain the same. You work directly with your Red Hat sales representative to determine sizing and pricing when moving to a certified cloud provider. Under this scenario, you pay Red Hat for subscriptions and pay Azure for its services.

### JBoss EAP deployment and pricing

There are many supported ways to deploy JBoss EAP on Azure, including as an application in Azure App Services, on VMs from the Azure Marketplace or your own custom-built images, or as a containerized application on ARO.

The subscriptions are available as PAYG or BYOS.

### ARO deployment and pricing

An Azure Red Hat OpenShift cluster consists of three main nodes and two or more worker nodes. Main nodes and worker nodes run on Azure VMs and are billed at Linux VM pricing. Worker nodes have an extra cost for the OpenShift subscription component.

ARO is only available as PAYG. Compute, networking, and storage resources consumed by your cluster are billed according to usage.

### Can I use my Azure Hybrid Benefits (AHB)?

Yes. The Red Hat Cloud Access program applies AHB for the same net effect.
