Azure App Service provides the hosting environment for an Azure-based web app. You can configure App Service to retrieve the image for the web app from a repository in Azure Container Registry. 

In the example scenario, the team has uploaded the image for the web app to Azure Container Registry and is now ready to deploy the web app.

In this unit, you'll create a new web app by using the Docker image stored in Azure Container Registry. You'll use App Service with a predefined App Service plan to host the web app.

## Enable Docker access to the Azure Container Registry

You'll use Docker to log in to the registry and pull the web image that you want to deploy. Docker needs a username and password to perform this action. The Container Registry enables you to set the registry name as the username and the admin access key as the password to allow Docker to log in to your container registry.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/?azure-portal=true), and go to **All resources**. The **All resources** pane appears.

1. Select the container registry you created earlier to go to its Overview page.

1. In the left menu pane, under **Settings**, select **Access keys**. The **Access keys** pane appears for your container registry.

1. Check the **Admin user** box. This change saves automatically.

You're now ready to create your web app.
