  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "What is the simplest method to identify the manufacturer and model of hardware of cluster nodes a few Azure Stack HCI clusters in your organization?"
    choices:
    - content: "Integrate the Azure Stack HCI clusters with Azure Monitor and run a Kusto query."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. While it's possible to identify the required information, this would require extra administrative effort."
    - content: "Use Windows Admin Center to connect to each cluster."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. While it's possible to identify the required information, this would require extra administrative effort."
    - content: "Use the Azure Stack HCI home blade in the Azure portal."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. The home page for the Azure Stack HCI resources lists all of your clusters, along with their resource group, location, and associated subscription. For each cluster, you can readily identify its name, OS version, OS build, model, total number of CPU cores, and its nodes. For each node, the portal displays its manufacturer, model, serial number, total number of CPU cores, the amount of memory, as well as OS version and OS build."
  - content: "What Azure Resource Manager feature should an administrator choose to facilitate consolidated billing of Azure Stack HCI clusters?"
    choices:
    - content: "Activity log"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Activity log provides a list of recent operations and events on the cluster along with their status, time, associated subscription, and initiating user."
    - content: "Access control"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Access control settings allow an administrator to review and modify role assignments that grant permissions to the Azure resource."
    - content: "Tags"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Tags allow an administrator to categorize resources and facilitate consolidated billing."
