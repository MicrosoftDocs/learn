  questions:
  - content: "What component is required in order to establish a logical connection between an Arc enabled resource and Azure?"
    choices:
    - content: "The Log Analytics agent."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The Log Analytics agent is not required when using Azure Arc, although it is recommended since it allows you to implement a rang of Azure hybrid services, such as Azure Monitor or Microsoft Defender for Cloud."
    - content: "The Microsoft Dependency agent."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The Microsoft Dependency agent is not required when using Azure Arc, although it is recommended, since it facilitates identifying internal and external dependencies of server workloads."
    - content: "The Connected Machine agent."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. In each of the Azure Arc enabled scenarios, Azure Arc leverages the locally installed Connected Machine agents to establish a logical connection between the local resource and Azure."
  - content: "What is necessary in order to integrate an Azure Stack HCI cluster with Azure Arc?"
    choices:
    - content: "Install the Connected Machine agent on each Azure Stack HCI cluster node."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. In case of Azure Stack HCI clusters, the Azure Arc agent is already included as part of the operating system of cluster nodes, so there is no need to install it."
    - content: "Install the Microsoft Dependency agent on each Azure Stack HCI cluster node."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The Microsoft Dependency agent is not required when integrating Azure Stack HCI with Azure Arc."
    - content: "Register the Azure Stack HCI cluster with Azure."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. To integrate an Azure Stack HCI cluster with Azure, the administrator needs to register it with Azure."
