In this module, you learned how to position objects on the scene by using the Transform component, creating parent objects, organizing a set of game objects, and configuring solvers.

There are pre-configured components and features in the Mixed Reality Toolkit that you can take advantage of to automate tedious tasks. Using these components can save time and help you reach your goal swiftly.

## Next steps

You can try placing objects on scene by using Transform or the shortcut symbols. You can also try to configure various types of solvers, and get to know how those work. Consider trying following interactions:

* Allow an object to follow you around by using solvers.
* Organize a set of objects in a circular format.

You can complete your mixed reality experience by building the Unity project and deploying to your preferred device. In Unity, ensure that you first save the scene, and add to the **Scenes in Build** window within **Build Settings**.
