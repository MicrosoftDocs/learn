In this module you learned how to position objects on the scene using transform, creating parent objects, organizing a set of game objects, and configuring solvers.

There are pre-configured components and features present in Mixed Reality Toolkit that can be used to automate a tedious task. Using these components can save up some of your time and assist you to reach your goal swiftly.

## Next steps

You can try placing objects on scene using transform or the shortcut symbols. You can also try to configure various types of solver and get to know how those work. Consider trying following interactions:

* Allow an object to follow you around using solvers
* Organize a set of objects in a circular format

You can complete your mixed reality experience by building the Unity project and deploying to your preferred device. In Unity, ensure that you first save the scene and add to the Scenes in Build window within Build Settings.
