In the Mixed Reality Toolkit (MRTK), placement tools let you dynamically place holograms in the scene to achieve complex spatial placement.

This module helps you to understand how to use MRTK features to organize objects in the scene and use a feature called *solvers* to intelligently track objects.

A completed example of this tutorial can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/MixedRealityLearning/tree/development/MRTK3%20Tutorials).
