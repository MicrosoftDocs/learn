In the Mixed Reality Toolkit (MRTK), placement tools let you dynamically place holograms in the scene to achieve complex spatial placement.

This module helps you to understand how to use MRTK features to organize objects in the scene and use a feature called *solvers* to intelligently track objects.

## Learning objectives

By the end of this module, you'll be able to:

* Position objects in the scene.
* Reposition objects by using solvers.
* Direct the user to objects by using solvers.

## Prerequisites

* A Windows 10 PC configured with the [correct tools](/windows/mixed-reality/develop/install-the-tools)
* Windows 10 SDK 10.0.18362.0 or later
* Unity Hub with Unity 2021.3 or later installed
* Basic familiarity with Unity, including the interface, scene creation, package import, and the addition of game objects to a scene
