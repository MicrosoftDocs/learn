Solvers are one of the components of the Mixed Reality Toolkit (MRTK). Let's take a look at two types of solvers and their respective functionalities.

## Location of solvers in the MRTK

The MRTK's solvers are located in the MRTK SDK folder. To see the available solvers in your project, in the Project window, go to **Packages** > **MRTK Spatial Manipulation** > **Solvers**.

## The Directional Indicator solver

Use the Directional Indicator solver to direct the user to objects. Here's how:

1. In the **Project** window, go to **Assets** > **MRTK.Tutorials.GettingStarted** > **Prefabs**. Drag the **Chevron** prefab into the **Hierarchy** window, and set its Transform **Position** to X = 0, Y = 1.5, Z = 2 to position it near the **RoverExplorer** object.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/select-chevron-prefab.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the newly added Chevron prefab selected." lightbox="../media/select-chevron-prefab.png":::

1. Rename the newly added Chevron object to **Indicator**. Then, in the **Inspector** window, select **Add Component** to add the **DirectionalIndicator**.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/add-directional-indicator.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the DirectionalIndicator solver component added." lightbox="../media/add-directional-indicator.png":::

1. Configure the **DirectionalIndicator** and **SolverHandler** components as follows:

    a. Verify that the **SolverHandler** component's **Tracked Target Type** is set to **Head**.

    b. Assign the **RoverExplorer** to the **DirectionalIndicator** component's **Directional Target**, by dragging it from **Hierarchy** into the **None (Transform)** field.

    c. Change the **View Offset** to **0.2**.

1. To enter **Game** mode, press **Play**. Press and hold the right mouse button while moving your mouse to the left or right to rotate your gaze direction. 

    Notice that when you look away from the **RoverExplorer** object, the **Indicator** object will appear and point toward the **RoverExplorer** object.

## The Tap To Place solver

Use the Tap To Place solver to reposition objects. Here's how:

1. In the **Hierarchy** window, select the **RoverExplorer** > **RoverAssembly** object. Then, in **Inspector**, use **Add Component** to add the **Tap To Place** component. Configure the component as follows:

    a. Verify that the **SolverHandler** component's **Tracked Target Type** is set to **Head**.

    b. Uncheck **Use Default Surface Normal Offset**, and ensure that **Surface Normal Offset** is set to 0.

    c. Select the **Keep Orientation Vertical** checkbox.

1. Next, use **Add Component** to add the **Stateful Interactable** component. In the **Inspector** window, locate the **On Clicked ()** event. Select the **+** icon to add a new event. Configure the event as follows:

    a. Assign the **RoverAssembly** object as a listener for the **On Clicked ()** event, by dragging it from **Hierarchy** into the **None (Object)** field.

    b. From the **No Function** dropdown list, select **TapToPlace** > **StartPlacement()** to call this method when the event is triggered.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/configure-start-event.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Tap To Place On Placing Started event configured." lightbox="../media/configure-start-event.png":::

1. With the **RoverAssembly** object still selected in the **Hierarchy** window, in the **Inspector** window, locate the **On Placing Started ()** event. Select the **+** icon to add a new event.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/add-start-event.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Tap To Place On Placing Started event added." lightbox="../media/add-start-event.png":::

1. Configure the event as follows:

    a. Assign the **RoverAssembly** object as a listener for the **On Placing Started ()** event, by dragging it from **Hierarchy** into the **None (Object)** field.

    b. From the **No Function** dropdown list, select **TapToPlace** > **float SurfaceNormalOffset** to update the **SurfaceNormalOffset** property value when the event is triggered.

    c. Verify that the argument is set to **0**.

1. In **Hierarchy**, right-click an empty spot. Select **3D Object** > **Cube** to create a temporary object representing the ground, and configure the **Transform** component as follows:

    * **Position**: X = 0, Y = 0.15, Z = 6
    * **Rotation**: X = 0, Y = 0, Z = 0
    * **Scale**: X = 10, Y = 0.2, Z = 10

1. To enter **Game** mode, press **Play**, then press and hold the right mouse button while moving your mouse down, until the gaze hits the **RoverAssembly** object.

1. Hold space bar and click the left mouse button to do an air tap, and start the tap-to-place process.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/split-view.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Play mode split view, with placing started." lightbox="../media/split-view.png":::

1. Press and hold the right mouse button while moving your mouse to the left or right to rotate your gaze direction. When you're happy with the placement, hold the space bar and click the left mouse button to do an ending air tap.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/split-view-end.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Play mode split view, with placing ended." lightbox="../media/split-view-end.png":::

1. When you're done testing the feature in **Game** mode, right-click the Cube object and select **Delete** to remove it from the scene.
