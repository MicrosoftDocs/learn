  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
    - content: "What is the LESS SECURE way to store your application secrets?"
      choices:
        - content: "Expose them as environment variables."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. Environment variables are commonly used and aren't the less secure solution."
        - content: "Store them in the application source code."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "You're correct. Storing secrets in the source code means that anybody with access to your code will know your secrets."
        - content: "Use a Secrets store."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. A Secrets store, like Azure Key Vault, is the best solution for storing your secrets."
        - content: "Store them using Kubernetes secrets."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. Kubernetes secrets are commonly used with Kubernetes, and aren't the less secure solution."
    - content: "How can a Java application access secret stored in Azure Key Vault?"
      choices:
        - content: "The application needs to store a login/password to Azure Key Vault in its source code"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. Storing secrets in the application source is a bad practice."
        - content: "All applications have automatic access to the Azure Key Vault instances stored in their resource group"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. Applications don't have access to any Azure Key Vault instance, unless they've been granted that access."
        - content: "An IT Operator needs to grant the application access to Azure Key Vault"
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "You're correct. An IT Operator needs to grant access permission, before the Java application can access the secrets."
        - content: "Azure Key Vault secrets are automatically exposed as environment variables to the application"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. You need a specific SDK to access the secrets, and exposing them as environment variables wouldn't be secure."
    - content: "What secrets can you store inside Azure Key Vault?"
      choices:
        - content: "Database passwords."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. You can store more than database passwords in Azure Key Vault."
        - content: "Secret access tokens."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. You can store more than secret tokens in Azure Key Vault."
        - content: "SSL/TLS certificates."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. You can store more than SSL/TLS certificates in Azure Key Vault."
        - content: "All of the above."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct. You can store your database passwords, secret access tokens, and SSL/TLS certificates in Azure Key Vault."
