Publishing an application programming interface (API) is a great way to increase market share, generate revenue, and foster innovation. However, maintaining even one API brings significant challenges such as onboarding users, managing revisions, implementing security, and running analytics

Imagine that your organization publishes multiple APIs for different types of users including partners, developers, and employees. These APIs are used in multiple settings, including mobile apps, web apps, and Internet of Things (IoT) devices.

Microsoft Azure API Management reduces the complexity of managing all your API traffic, and it offers intuitive portals for managing your APIs as well as surfacing them to developers. It also provides tools for implementing security, managing revisions, and performing analytics.

## Example scenario

Suppose you work at a company that operates a food-delivery platform. Your customers use your mobile app or website to browse the menus of multiple restaurants and place an order. The APIs that you publish are used by a large collection of consumers, and each resides on a different server, has its own user onboarding process, and policies for security, revisions, analytics, and more.

Here, you learn how Azure API Management can standardize, centralize, and help secure all the aspects of publishing and maintaining APIs across the full API lifecycle to reduce complexity.

## What will we be doing?

We'll examine Azure API Management to help you decide if it's the correct solution to reduce your company's API complexity by studying these three main components:

- **Gateway**. A single endpoint for all your API calls, which eases the implementation of security, rate limits, caching, and transformations.
- **Administration interface**. A single interface where you import APIs, set policies, create API products, manage users and groups, and run analytics.
- **Developer portal**. A website that brings all your APIs into a single location for developers to read documentation, test APIs, review code samples, get API keys, and run analytics.

We'll also study Azure API Management from these three user angles:

- **API consumers**. Entities (such as applications) that get value from using an API.
- **API providers**. People who administer and maintain APIs.
- **App developers**. People who build applications that consume APIs.

## What is the main goal?

By the end of this session, you can evaluate whether Azure API Management is the correct solution for keeping your organization's APIs under a single management umbrella.
