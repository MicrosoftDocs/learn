Our goal in this module was to help you evaluate whether Azure API Management is appropriate for managing and publishing your organization's APIs. To help you make that decision, we presented criteria you can use including number of APIs, rate of API changes, and API admin load.

We applied these criteria in the context of our fictional food delivery organization. You learned that in most scenarios, Azure API Management offers improved API standardization, enhanced centralization of API operations, and tightened API security.

However, you also learned that some organizations might not benefit from using Azure API Management. This is true if they have a small number of deployed APIs, mostly static APIs, or APIs requiring few policies, users, and analytics.

The API economy increasingly drives today's connected world. If you want to maximize your API economy, use the criteria in this module to assess your ability to adapt APIs to satisfy consumers, follow business trends, and take advantage of new opportunities. The process you went through here should give you enough information to choose the correct API lifecycle management solution for your organization.
