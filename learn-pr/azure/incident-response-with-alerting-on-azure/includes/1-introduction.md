Microsoft Azure provides a robust alerting and monitoring solution: Azure Monitor. You use Azure Monitor to configure notifications and alerts for your key systems and applications. These alerts will ensure that the correct team knows when a problem arises.  

You work for a large shipping company that recently deployed several web applications to the Azure platform. Due to a configuration error, the customer-facing order tracker was offline. The issue wasn't identified until customers started complaining that they couldn't track their orders. As a consequence, customer satisfaction with your service dropped.

As your company's Azure solution architect, you need to find a solution that detects problems in your environments in real time. The correct team will be notified so it can resolve any problems before your customers notice.
