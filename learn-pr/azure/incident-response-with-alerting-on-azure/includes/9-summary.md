In this module, you learned how Azure Monitor alerts and notifications help you manage your systems and environment. You explored three different types of alerts: metric, log, and activity log.

You learned how metric alerts enable time-series evaluations, which trigger an action group when the alert is fired.

You also learned how log alert runs specify log queries at regular time intervals. The runs trigger an action group when a match is found.

Lastly, you learned how activity log alerts enable notifications when a named Azure resource meets the specified conditions.
