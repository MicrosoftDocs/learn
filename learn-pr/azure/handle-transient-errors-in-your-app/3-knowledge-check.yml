  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "Why should an app back-off from trying to read from a database that is responding too slowly?"
    choices:
    - content: "The database could be under heavy load, so backing-off could give it time to recover."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "If a database is responding, but taking longer than normal, it could be under excessive load."
    - content: "The database server is being upgraded, so retrying can cause the upgrade to fail."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The database is responding, if the service was being upgraded then the app wouldn't be getting any response." 
    - content: "Backing-off means that the app can retry the operation quicker, to get a faster response."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "If the app retries the operation when a service or database is slow to respond, it could make the situation worse by increasing the load on it."
  - content: "Why is it important that operations are idempotent if they're being retried?"
    choices:
    - content: "Retrying the operation leads to data being incremented the number of times the operation is processed successfully."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This example describes an operation that isn't idempotent. Data can be incorrectly incremented if operations are duplicated."
    - content: "If the operation is going to be retried, and previous operations have all failed, the data can be incorrect."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This example is incorrect because idempotent operations don't rely on previous requests working. They can be applied once or many times." 
    - content: "If the operation is retried and previous operations have been successful, the data isn't duplicated or corrupted."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Idempotent operations are important to ensure values aren't corrupted if they're applied multiple times."       
  - content: "What's the main difference between permanent and terminal errors?"
    choices: 
    - content: "Permanent errors need to be handled and then quit the app. Terminal errors automatically quit the app."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Permanent errors can allow the app to keep running, since data might be available from cache. Terminal errors don't automatically quit the app."
    - content: "Permanent errors can be handled by using data from elsewhere. Terminal errors mean the app can't continue and should quit."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "With permanent errors, the app can't expect a response from the service, and it should try to get the data from another service or a local cache. An app can no longer do anything useful when it receives a terminal error and should therefore quit." 
    - content: "Permanent errors are unrecoverable, log the data and quit. Terminal errors shouldn't log data and quit. "
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Permanent errors can allow the app to keep running, data might be available from cache. All errors should log data."
