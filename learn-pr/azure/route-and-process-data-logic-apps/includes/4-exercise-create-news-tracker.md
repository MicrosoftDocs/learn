## Get API key and endpoint for Bing Search

To use the **Bing Search** trigger in your workflow, you need an API key and API endpoint for the Bing Search API. To get this key and endpoint, you have to create a Bing resource in Azure.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), sign in with your Azure account.

1. In the Azure search box, enter **bing**, and select **Bing Resources**.

1. On the **Bing Resources** page toolbar, select **Add** **>** **Bing Search**.

   | Property | Value | Description |
   |----------|-------|-------------|
   | **Subscription** | <*Azure-subscription*> | Select your Azure subscription. |
   | **Resource group** | <*resource-group*> | Select **Create New**, and then create a resource group with a unique name to use across this module. |
   | **Name** | <*Bing-resource*> | Enter unique name for your Bing resource. This example uses **MyBingSearch**. |
   | **Region** | **Global** | Your resource works across multiple Azure regions. |
   | **Pricing tier** | **F1** | This tier provides 3 calls per second with a limit of 1,000 calls per month. For pricing information, see [Bing Search API pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/cognitive-services/bing-entity-search-api/). |

1. When you finish, select **I confirm I have read and understood the notice above.** **>** **Review + create**.

1. After deployment completes, select **Go to resource**.

1. On the resource menu, under **Resource management**, select **Keys and Endpoint**.

1. Copy and save the following values somewhere safe:

   * **Key 1** or **Key 2**
   * **Endpoint**

   :::image type="content" source="../media/bing-search-api-info.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows Bing Search API key and endpoint.":::

## Create the logic app resource

Now, create the logic app resource in Azure.

1. In the Azure portal search box, find and select **Logic apps**.

1. On the **Logic apps** page toolbar, select **Add**.

   The **Create Logic App** page appears with the available logic app types and hosting plans.

1. Select the **Consumption (Multitenant)** hosting plan, and then continue with **Select**.

   The **Consumption** plan specifies that your logic app workflow runs in the multitenant, global Azure environment and uses the **Consumption** billing and pricing model, which is pay per operation execution. For more information, see [Consumption Plan (Multitenant)](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/logic-apps/). Other hosting plans are also available for different hosting environments.

1. On the **Basics** tab, provide the following information about your logic app resource and leave all other options to their defaults:

   | Property | Value |
   |----------|-------|
   | **Subscription** | Select your Azure subscription. |
   | **Resource Group** | Select **Create New**, and then create a resource group with a unique name. |
   | **Logic app name** | Enter a unique name for your logic app. This example uses **ShoeNewsTracker<*random-string*>**, replacing the <*random-string*> placeholder with numbers or letters. |
   | **Region** | Select an Azure region nearest you. |
  
1. Select **Review + create**, and then select **Create**.

   The Azure portal shows the deployment pane with the deployment progress and the resources that Azure creates.

1. After Azure completes the deployment, select **Go to resource**.

   The **Overview** page for your logic app appears.

1. To open the workflow designer, on the logic app menu, under Development Tools, selects **Logic app designer**.

## Add a **Bing Search** trigger named **On new news article**

Typically, when you start with an empty workflow, you find a connector that has a trigger for the condition to meet for starting the workflow. In this example, you start with the **Bing Search** connector because the condition is when a new news article is available. You add the **Bing Search** trigger and provide values for all the required parameters.

For this step, you need to get the API key and API endpoint for the Bing News Search service.

If you don't want to use Bing Search, you can follow the steps, but substitute the **RSS** trigger instead, which doesn't require any keys or secrets. You only have to provide the URL for the RSS feed plus the frequency and interval. The downside to the **RSS** trigger is that new articles appear infrequently in RSS feeds, so you might have to wait a while before this trigger activates or returns results.

1. On the workflow designer, select **Add a trigger**.

   The **Add a trigger** pane opens and shows the connector gallery for available triggers.

1. In the **Add a trigger** search box, find and select the **Bing Search** trigger named **On a new news article**.

   *Substitution*: In the search box, find and select the **RSS** trigger named **When a feed item is published**.

1. To access the **Bing Search** service, you need to create a connection by providing the following information:

   *Substitution*: The **RSS** trigger doesn't have this step.

   | Property | Required | Value | Description |
   |----------|----------|-------|-------------|
   | **Connection Name** | Yes | **ShoeNewsBingConnection** | The name to give your connection |
   | **API Key** | Yes | <*api-key*> | The API key that you previously copied for the **Bing Search** API. |
   | **API Endpoint** | Yes | <*api-endpoint*> | Select the API endpoint with the same domain name as the one you copied for the **Bing Search** API. This example uses **`https://api.bing.microsoft.com/v7.0`**. |

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   >
   > For optimal security, Microsoft recommends that you use [Microsoft Entra ID](/entra/identity/authentication/overview-authentication) 
   > with [managed identities](/entra/identity/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview) 
   > for authentication when possible. This option provides superior security without having to provide 
   > credentials. Azure manages this identity and helps keep authentication information secure so that 
   > you don't have to manage this sensitive information. To set up a managed identity for Azure Logic Apps, 
   > see [Authenticate access and connections to Azure resources with managed identities in Azure Logic Apps](/azure/logic-apps/authenticate-with-managed-identity).

1. When you finish, select **Create new**.

   *Substitution*: The **RSS** trigger doesn't have this step.

   If you successfully create the connection, the information box appears for the **Bing Search** trigger named **On new news article**.

1. In the **Bing Search** trigger, provide the following information:

   | Parameter | Required | Value | Description |
   |-----------|----------|-------|-------------|
   | **Search Query** | Yes | **shoe** | The text to find in the news article. |

   Under **How often do you want to check for items**, provide the following values:

   | Parameter | Required | Value | Description |
   |-----------|----------|-------|-------------|
   | **Interval** | Yes | **16** | The number of time units to wait until the next check. For example, an interval of **3** and a frequency of **Hour** checks for new articles every 3 hours. <br><br>For this exercise, we want to only manually activate the trigger, not on a schedule, so set the interval to the largest value possible for the **Month** frequency, which is **16** in this example. |
   | **Frequency** | Yes | **Month** | The time unit to use for the polling interval, for example, **Second**, **Minute**, **Hour**, **Day**, **Week**, or **Month**. |
   | **Advanced parameters** | No | None | Any parameters to add to the trigger. |

   For example, the trigger now looks like the following example:

   :::image type="content" source="../media/bing-search-trigger.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows Bing Search trigger with example values.":::

1. If you're using the RSS trigger, provide the following information:

   | Parameter | Required | Value | Description |
   |-----------|----------|-------|-------------|
   | **RSS feed URL** | Yes | **`https://feeds.a.dj.com/rss/RSSWorldNews.xml`** | The RSS feed URL to check. <br><br>You can use any RSS feed that doesn't require HTTP authorization, but choose an RSS feed that publishes frequently, so you can easily test your workflow. |
   | **Advanced parameters** | No | None | Any parameters to add to the trigger. |
   | **Chosen property used to determine which items are new** | No | **UpdatedOn** | The property to use for determining which articles to return. The default is **PublishDate**. |

   Under **How often do you want to check for items**, provide the following values:

   | Parameter | Required | Value | Description |
   |-----------|----------|-------|-------------|
   | **Interval** | Yes | **16** | The number of time units to wait until the next check. For example, an interval of **3** and a frequency of **Hour** checks for new articles every three hours. <br><br>For this exercise, we want to only manually activate the trigger, not on a schedule, so set the interval to the largest value possible for the **Month** frequency, which is **16** in this example. For the minimum interval, see [RSS connector reference](/connectors/rss/). |
   | **Frequency** | Yes | **Month** | The time unit to use for the polling interval, for example, **Second**, **Minute**, **Hour**, **Day**, **Week**, or **Month**. |

   :::image type="content" source="../media/dow-jones-trigger.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows RSS trigger with example values.":::

1. When you finish, on the designer toolbar, select **Save**.

   When you save your workflow, Azure automatically pushes your saved changes to your deployed logic app resource, which is already live. If any errors exist in your trigger setup, Azure shows those errors.

1. Test the trigger. To manually activate the trigger, on the designer toolbar, select **Run** > **Run**.

   The trigger checks the **Bing Search** service for any news articles that contain your search text and are available at the current time.

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   >
   > If you use an Azure subscription that incurs charges, your subscription might incur 
   > a small charge when you run the **Bing Search** trigger and other "managed" operations 
   > The **Consumption** plan specifies that metering and billing apply as described:
   > 
   > - **Built-in (in-app) operations**: The first X number of executions are free. Afterwards, pay-per-execution pricing applies.
   > - **Managed (shared) operations**: Pay-per-execution pricing applies.
   >
   > To minimize charges, make sure to clean up your resources after you finish this module.
   >

   > Select your region, currency, and then the **Consumption Plan (Mutlitenant)** tab.

Let's review the trigger history.

## Review trigger history

The **Trigger history** tab only shows information about your workflow's trigger, for example, whether trigger fired or was skipped.

1. On the logic app menu, select **Overview**.

1. On the **Overview** page, select the **Trigger history** tab.

   The trigger history shows two entries for a single event. One entry shows the trigger checking the associated service or system. The other entry shows that the trigger fired if the trigger condition was met. Each entry shows an ID number, status, start time, and whether the trigger fired.

   > [!TIP]
   >
   > If no recent results appear, on the **Overview** page toolbar, select **Refresh**.

   Based on the trigger result, the **Status** and **Fired** columns can show the following values:

   | Trigger result | Status column | Fired column | Description |
   |----------------|---------------|--------------|-------------|
   | No result found | **Skipped** | <*empty*> | The trigger checked the service, but the condition wasn't met. No other workflow steps are run. <br><br>**Note**: If no news articles match your search at the current time, the trigger doesn't return any results. You might have to wait and periodically retry running the trigger more than once. |
   | Result found | **Succeeded** | **Fired** | The trigger checked the service, and the condition was met. The trigger fired and starts to run any subsequent steps. If multiple matches exist, the trigger fires for each match. <br><br>For this example, we're only testing, so no other steps are available to run. <br><br>If the trigger successfully fires, and all existing steps successfully complete, the run details page opens. This page looks similar to the designer, but shows the status and time taken for each operation to run. We'll review this page in more detail later. |

1. If the trigger succeeded and shows the **Fired** label, you can view the trigger outputs. Continue to the next step.

   Otherwise, if the trigger was skipped, try periodically rerunning the trigger. On the **Overview** page toolbar, select **Run** **>** **Run**.

## Review trigger outputs

After the trigger successfully fires, you can view information about the found news article.

### View from trigger history

1. On the **Trigger history** tab, select the row for either trigger entry.

1. On the **History** page, under **Outputs link**, select the link.

   On the **Outputs** page, in the **body** JSON object, information about the matching news article appears.

### View from run history

The **Runs history** tab only shows information about workflow runs, for example, whether they succeeded or failed. If a trigger is skipped, the **Runs history** tab doesn't show any run information for that specific trigger event.

For a fired trigger, you can still view the trigger outputs on this tab by following these steps:

1. On the **Overview** page, select the **Runs history** tab.

   Each run has an ID number, status, start time, duration, and whether the run used static results, which aren't in scope for this module. A trigger can successfully fire, but the workflow can succeed or fail.

   > [!TIP]
   >
   > If no recent results appear, on the **Overview** page toolbar, select **Refresh**.

1. Select the row for a workflow run.

   The workflow's run details page opens and shows the status and time taken for each operation to run. From this view, you can also review the data that flowed through each operation.

1. To view the trigger's inputs and outputs, on the run details page, select the trigger.

   A pane opens to show the trigger's **INPUTS** and **OUTPUTS** sections.

1. In the **OUTPUTS** section, in the **body** field, find the description and other information for the matching article. To review the complete response in JSON format, next to the **OUTPUTS** label, select **Show raw outputs**.

The next unit introduces actions, which perform various tasks in a workflow.
