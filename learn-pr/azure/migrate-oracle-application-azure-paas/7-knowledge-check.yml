  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "How do PaaS products help you reduce your IT management load?"
    choices:
    - content: "They give you fine control over the host operating system and hardware."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. One of the advantages of PaaS solutions is that they remove the need to manage OS and hardware configuration."
    - content: "They allow you to closely recreate your on-premises datacenter infrastructure."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. PaaS solutions don't aim to accurately recreate your on-premises configuration."
    - content: "They manage the underlying software, host operating systems, and hardware infrastructure. "
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct!"
  - content: "Which of these answers is a reason to choose an Azure PaaS database server?"
    choices:
    - content: "You want to stop managing and configuring the operating system running your database servers."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct!"
    - content: "You want to reuse your existing Oracle software licensing."
      isCorrect: false

    - content: "You want your IT team to improve its cloud infrastructure skills."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. PaaS products manage the underlying infrastructure for you and eliminate many traditional IT tasks."

    choices:
    - content: "Rebuild your application using .NET Core."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Most popular programming languages can connect to PaaS database services if modified to do so."
    - content: "Set up new DevOps processes to manage your code development."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Your code DevOps processes shouldn't be affected by using a PaaS database solution."
    - content: "Remediate issues introduced during the migration by identifying Oracle-specific code and updating it to work with your new database service. "
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct!"
