Azure doesn't monitor security or respond to security incidents within the customer's area of responsibility. Azure does provide many tools, like Microsoft Defender for Cloud and Microsoft Sentinel, that customers can use for this purpose. There's also an effort to help make every service as secure as possible by default; that is, every service comes with a baseline that is already designed to help provide security for most common use cases. Because Azure can't predict how you'll use a service, you should always review security controls to evaluate whether they adequately mitigate risks.

This module guides you through the steps of creating a security baseline for Azure services. Each unit provides a checklist of items to verify in the services you're using in your architecture.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you'll:

- Learn about Azure platform security baselines and how they were created.
- Create and validate a security baseline for the most commonly used Azure services.
