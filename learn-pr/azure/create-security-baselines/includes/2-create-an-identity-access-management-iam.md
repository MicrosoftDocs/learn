Identity and access management (IAM) is key to granting access and to the security enhancement of corporate assets. To secure and control your cloud-based assets, you must manage identity and access for your Azure administrators, application developers, and application users.

## IAM security recommendations

The following sections describe the IAM recommendations that are in CIS Microsoft Azure Foundations Security Benchmark v. 3.0.0. Included with each recommendation are the basic steps to complete in the Azure portal. You should complete these steps for your own subscription and by using your own resources to validate each security recommendation. Keep in mind that **Level 2** options might restrict some features or activities, so carefully consider which security options you decide to enforce.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You must be an administrator for the Microsoft Entra instance to complete some of these steps.

### Restrict access to the Microsoft Entra administration portal - Level 1

Users who aren't administrators shouldn't have access to the Microsoft Entra administration portal because the data is sensitive and under the rules of least privilege.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com). Search for and select **Microsoft Entra ID**.

1. In the left menu under **Manage**, select **Users**.

1. In the left menu, select **User settings**.

1. In **User settings**, under **Administration center**, ensure that **Restrict access to Microsoft Entra administration center** is set to **Yes**. Setting this value to **Yes** prevents all non-administrators from accessing any data in the Microsoft Entra administration portal. The setting doesn't restrict access to using PowerShell or another client, such as Visual Studio.

1. If you change any settings, select **Save** in the menu bar.

### Enable multifactor authentication for Microsoft Entra users

- **Enable multifactor authentication for Microsoft Entra ID privileged users - Level 1**
- **Enable multifactor authentication for Microsoft Entra non-privileged users - Level 2**

Enable multifactor authentication for all Microsoft Entra users.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com). Search for and select **Microsoft Entra ID**.

1. In the left menu under **Manage**, select **Users**.

1. In the **All users** menu bar, select **Per-user MFA**.

### Don't remember multifactor authentication on trusted devices - Level 2

Remembering the multifactor authentication feature for devices and browsers that are trusted by the user is a free feature for all multifactor authentication users. Users can bypass subsequent verifications for a specified number of days after they've successfully signed in to a device by using multifactor authentication.

If an account or device is compromised, remembering multifactor authentication for trusted devices can negatively affect security. A security recommendation is to turn off remembering multifactor authentication for trusted devices.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com). Search for and select **Microsoft Entra ID**.

1. In the left menu under **Manage**, select **Users**.

1. In the **All users** menu bar, select **Per-user MFA**.

1. In the **Per-user multifactor authentication** window, select a user. Select the **User MFA settings** button.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/identity-access-management-azure-active-directory/multifactor-authentication-window.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Microsoft Entra multifactor authentication users window and the manage user settings link.":::

1. Select the **Restore multifactor authentication on all remembered devices** checkbox, and then select **Save**.

### Ensure guest users are reviewed on a regular basis - Level 1

Ensure that no guest users exist, or alternatively, if the business requires guest users, ensure that guest permissions are limited.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com). Search for and select **Microsoft Entra ID**.

1. In the left menu under **Manage**, select **Users**.

1. If you change any settings, select **Save** in the menu bar.

### Password options

- **Notify users on password resets - Level 1**
- **Notify all admins when other admins reset passwords - Level 2**
- **Require two methods to reset passwords - Level 1**

With multifactor authentication set, an attacker would have to compromise both identity authentication forms before they could maliciously reset a user's password. Ensure that password reset requires two forms of identity authentication.

1. In the left menu under **Manage**, select **Password reset**.

1. In the left menu under **Manage**, select **Authentication methods**.

### Establish an interval for reconfirming user authentication methods - Level 1

If authentication reconfirmation is turned off, registered users aren't prompted to reconfirm their authentication information. The more secure option is to turn on authentication reconfirmation for a set interval.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com). Search for and select **Microsoft Entra ID**.

1. In the left menu under **Manage**, select **Password reset**.

1. In the left menu under **Manage**, select **Registration**.
