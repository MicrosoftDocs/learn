quiz:
  questions:
  - content: "Which of the following best describes High Availability (HA)?"
    choices:
    - content: "The database has enough performance to be available."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "While performance issues can impact availability, high availability protects against other issues like hardware failure."
    - content: "The database is available in every region."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "A highly available database is available on at least two nodes, not every region."
    - content: "The database has at least one replica."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct, a highly available database has at least one replica in the same zone or another zone."
  - content: "The Burstable tier is best for which of these use cases:"
    choices:
    - content: "The server load is usually low, but occasionally high."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct, during low traffic, the server accumulates credits used during the occasional bursts."
    - content: "The server load is usually high, but occasionally low."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The Burstable tier isn't meant to handle consistently high traffic."
    - content: "The server load is medium for CPU with unpredictable IOPS."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The Burstable tier responds to compute bursts, not IOPS (for that, see the Autoscale IOPS feature)."
  - content: "Pre-provisioned IOPS might be adjusted:"
    choices:
    - content: "Automatically according to server load."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Pre-provisioned IOPS are a constant capacity, not dynamic according to load."
    - content: "Manually by an administrator."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct, IOPS are provisioned with a user operation."
    - content: "Automatically according to user-defined policies."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Pre-provisioned IOPS are a constant capacity, not dynamic according to a policy."
  - content: "Read replicas are useful when you need to:"
    choices:
    - content: "Replicate the application in another region."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The application needs read-write access to its database, not a read-only copy of the other region's data."
    - content: "Read the latest transactional data in another zone."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "While read replicas are quite fast, the replica isn't guaranteed to be totally consistent with the primary database."
    - content: "Run intensive reports during peak application traffic."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "This is an excellent use case for read replicas. Reports can typically tolerate seconds or even minutes of delay."
  - content: "Your workload is very high in the morning Monday through Friday, but generally low otherwise. Uptime is extremely important during these times. You choose:"
    choices:
    - content: "Burstable Tier compute, with autoscaled IOPS."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The Burstable tier isn't best suited for mission-critical applications."
    - content: "General-purpose tier, with maximum pre-provisioned IOPS."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "While this might meet the needs of the peak hours, the IOPS are very overprovisioned outside of weekday mornings, making this solution less cost-effective."
    - content: "Business Critical Tier compute, with autoscaled IOPS."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "This is the most cost-effective solution that also provides the strongest uptime and performance."
