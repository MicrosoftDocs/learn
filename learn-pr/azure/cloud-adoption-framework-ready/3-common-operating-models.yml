  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: Which of the following best describes the operating model at Tailwind Traders?
    choices:
    - content: Decentralized operations
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Since all production operations are supported by a centralized team, this isn't an operating model that Tailwind Traders could support.
    - content: Centralized operations
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct!
    - content: Enterprise operations
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: See the last question in the knowledge check to understand why enterprise operations aren't currently a good fit for Tailwind Traders.
    - content: Distributed operations
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Operations at Tailwind Traders aren't complex enough to fit this operating model.
  - content: In the customer narrative, there's a controlled process for release of the solutions coming from the retail innovation team. If that process improves to allow that team to manage their own workloads in a controlled landing zone, which operating model would better describe the new arrangement?
    choices:
    - content: Decentralized operations
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: The central operations team isn't going away, so decentralized still wouldn't fit.
    - content: Centralized operations
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: When additional teams are allowed to manage production operations, the centralized model becomes unruly. If that increased pace of innovation is required, Tailwind Traders should consider an enterprise operations model.
    - content: Enterprise operations
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct!
    - content: Distributed operations
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Fortunately, this change wouldn't suggest a distributed operations approach. Try again.
  - content: The retail innovation team was entirely workload-focused before they were acquired by Tailwind Traders. Based on our limited knowledge, what operating model best describes how that team operated prior to the acquisition?
    choices:
    - content: Decentralized operations
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct!
    - content: Centralized operations
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: There weren't centralized support services before the acquisition. Try again.
    - content: Enterprise operations
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Enterprise operations would require centralized operations and innovative workload teams. There weren't centralized support services before the acquisition.
    - content: Distributed operations
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: While the company might become distributed after a few more acquisitions, Tailwind Traders isn't there today, nor was the startup prior to acquisition.
  # - content: Which of the following is an indicator that centralized operations is the better fit for Tailwind Traders?
  #   choices:
  #   - content: Openness to embrace cloud-native operations tools and processes
  #     isCorrect: false
  #     explanation: The narrative suggests limited appetite for cloud-native tools and processes. This customer currently needs a best-of-breed approach.
  #   - content: Multiple teams accessing production environments
  #     isCorrect: false
  #     explanation: Only the central operations team has access to production. There is no need currently for a more complex approach to separation of duties.
  #   - content: Central operations team size
  #     isCorrect: true
  #     explanation: There are indications that an enterprise operations approach could provide advantages, but the strained staff and lack of well-organized teams outside of central operations would add strain to the current team structure. Organizational change would be required to adopt enterprise operations.
  #   - content: Scope of the portfolio
  #     isCorrect: false
  #     explanation: The overall scope of the portfolio is large enough to qualify for enterprise operations. This is an indicator that an enterprise operations approach might be beneficial.
