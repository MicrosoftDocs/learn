  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: Which of the following best describes the operating model at Tailwind Traders?
    choices:
    - content: Decentralized operations
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Because a centralized team supports all production operations, Tailwind Traders can't support this operating model.
    - content: Centralized operations
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct!
    - content: Enterprise operations
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: See the last question in the knowledge check to understand why enterprise operations aren't currently a good fit for Tailwind Traders.
    - content: Distributed operations
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Operations at Tailwind Traders aren't complex enough to fit this operating model.
  - content: In the customer narrative, there's a controlled process for release of the solutions that come from the retail innovation team. If that process improves to allow that team to manage its own workloads in a controlled landing zone, which operating model would best describe the new arrangement?
    choices:
    - content: Decentralized operations
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: The central operations team isn't going away, so decentralized still wouldn't fit.
    - content: Centralized operations
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: When additional teams are allowed to manage production operations, the centralized model becomes unruly. If an increased pace of innovation is required, Tailwind Traders should consider an enterprise operations model.
    - content: Enterprise operations
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct!
    - content: Distributed operations
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Fortunately, this change wouldn't suggest a distributed operations approach. Try again.
  - content: The retail innovation team was entirely workload-focused before Tailwind Traders acquired it. Based on what you know, what operating model best describes how that team operated before the acquisition?
    choices:
    - content: Decentralized operations
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct!
    - content: Centralized operations
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: There were no centralized support services before the acquisition. Try again.
    - content: Enterprise operations
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Enterprise operations would require centralized operations and innovative workload teams. There were no centralized support services before the acquisition.
    - content: Distributed operations
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Although the company might become distributed after a few more acquisitions, Tailwind Traders isn't there today, nor was the startup before the acquisition.
  # - content: Which of the following is an indicator that centralized operations are the better fit for Tailwind Traders?
  #   choices:
  #   - content: Openness to embrace cloud-native operations tools and processes
  #     isCorrect: false
  #     explanation: The narrative suggests limited appetite for cloud-native tools and processes. This customer currently needs a best-of-breed approach.
  #   - content: Multiple teams accessing production environments
  #     isCorrect: false
  #     explanation: Only the central operations team has access to production. There is no need currently for a more complex approach to separation of duties.
  #   - content: Size of the central operations team
  #     isCorrect: true
  #     explanation: There are indications that an enterprise operations approach could provide advantages, but the strained staff and lack of well-organized teams outside central operations would add strain to the current team structure. Organizational change would be required to adopt enterprise operations.
  #   - content: Scope of the portfolio
  #     isCorrect: false
  #     explanation: The overall scope of the portfolio is large enough to qualify for enterprise operations. This is an indicator that an enterprise operations approach might be beneficial.
