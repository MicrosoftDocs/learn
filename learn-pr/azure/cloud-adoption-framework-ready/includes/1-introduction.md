Cloud adoption and operations depend on your early platform decisions. In this module, you'll compare common operating models and options for implementing Azure landing zones. The goal is to find the best path to a fully configured cloud platform.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you'll:

- Compare your management, governance, and security requirements for operations to common operating models.
- Evaluate options for implementing Azure landing zones against your short-term and long-term requirements.
- Choose the best Azure landing zone and Learn modules to support your needs for cloud adoption.

## Prerequisites

- An understanding of your organization's cloud adoption strategy.
- Familiarity with Azure cloud environment, including network configuration, network connectivity, and Microsoft Entra ID.
- Familiarity with Azure governance tools, including Azure Policy and Azure Resource Manager templates.
- A general understanding of the environmental requirements for proceeding with your cloud adoption plan.
- A basic understanding of the following two terms:
  - **Azure landing zones**: Azure landing zones provide an accelerated approach to deploying your cloud platform. That platform consists of critical design areas that should be included in your cloud environment. After you deploy the platform, you can modify the architectures that define Azure landing zones to meet your business, operations, and technical requirements.
  - **Operating model**: The way you choose to operate and run technology solutions will have a big impact on the design of your environment and the initial architecture for configuring your environment. Your cloud operating model is the specific way that you want to operate assets hosted in the cloud. Aligning to an operating model will help you to quickly assess requirements for governance, security, and operations management.
