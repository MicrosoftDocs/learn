Azure landing zones provide cloud-adoption teams with a well-managed environment for their workloads. Each of the following implementation options applies a predetermined set of design considerations for landing zones to provide an implementation and architecture to guide your environment configuration.

## Partner implementation options

Configuration of your cloud environment can be one of the biggest enablers for cloud success. It can also be one of the biggest blockers if the configuration is misaligned with how you want to operate workloads in the cloud. If the success of your adoption project is critical and your team isn't sure how to proceed, [consult with a partner](https://www.microsoft.com/azure/partners/adopt?filters=ready&azure-protal=true) about how to move forward.

Many of the top Microsoft partners provide offerings aligned to the Ready methodology of the Cloud Adoption Framework. Those offerings typically include a partner's own customized implementation of an Azure landing zone.

Before you engage a partner, review the guide to evaluating [partner implementation options for Azure landing zones](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/landing-zone/partner-landing-zone?azure-portal=true).

## Implementation options for starting small

The following implementation options can help you start small and expand. These options are best for central operations. Each option establishes a less complex initial implementation by using Azure-native governance and operations tooling that can then be refactored to meet your needs.

- **CAF Migration landing zone blueprint:** Deploys the basic foundation for migrating low-risk assets. Review the [design principles](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/landing-zone/migrate-landing-zone#design-principles?azure-portal=true) or [deploy](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/landing-zone/migrate-landing-zone?azure-portal=true) this solution to your Azure environment.
- **CAF Foundation blueprint:** Adds the minimum tools that you need to begin developing a governance strategy. Review the [design principles](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/landing-zone/foundation-blueprint#design-principles?Azure-portal=true) or [deploy](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/landing-zone/foundation-blueprint?azure-protal=true) this solution to your Azure environment.
- **CAF Terraform modules:** Partner path for multiple-cloud operating models. This path can limit Azure-first operating models. Review the [design principles](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/landing-zone/terraform-landing-zone#design-decisions?azure-portal=true) or [deploy](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/landing-zone/terraform-landing-zone#customize-and-deploy-your-first-landing-zone?azure-portal=true) this solution to your Azure environment.

## Implementation options for enterprise scale

The following implementation options are for starting at an enterprise scale. These options are best for enterprise operations. Each option builds toward a more robust enterprise architecture. 

- **CAF Enterprise-Scale foundation:** This is the suggested foundation for enterprise-scale adoption. Review the [example in GitHub](https://github.com/Azure/Enterprise-Scale/blob/main/docs/reference/wingtip/README.md) or [deploy](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_CreateUIDef/CustomDeploymentBlade/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FAzure%2FEnterprise-Scale%2Fmain%2Fdocs%2Freference%2Fwingtip%2FarmTemplates%2Fes-foundation.json/createUIDefinitionUri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FAzure%2FEnterprise-Scale%2Fmain%2Fdocs%2Freference%2Fwingtip%2FarmTemplates%2Fportal-es-foundation.json) this solution to your Azure environment.
- **CAF Enterprise-Scale Virtual WAN:** Add an Azure Virtual WAN module to the enterprise-scale foundation. Review the [example in GitHub](https://github.com/Azure/Enterprise-Scale/blob/main/docs/reference/contoso/Readme.md) or [deploy](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_CreateUIDef/CustomDeploymentBlade/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FAzure%2FEnterprise-Scale%2Fmain%2Fdocs%2Freference%2Fcontoso%2FarmTemplates%2Fes-vwan.json/createUIDefinitionUri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FAzure%2FEnterprise-Scale%2Fmain%2Fdocs%2Freference%2Fcontoso%2FarmTemplates%2Fportal-es-vwan.json) this solution to your Azure environment.
- **CAF Enterprise-Scale hub and spoke:** Add a Virtual WAN module to the enterprise-scale foundation. Review the [example in GitHub](https://github.com/Azure/Enterprise-Scale/blob/main/docs/reference/adventureworks/README.md) or [deploy](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_CreateUIDef/CustomDeploymentBlade/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FAzure%2FEnterprise-Scale%2Fmain%2Fdocs%2Freference%2Fadventureworks%2FarmTemplates%2Fes-hubspoke.json/createUIDefinitionUri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FAzure%2FEnterprise-Scale%2Fmain%2Fdocs%2Freference%2Fadventureworks%2FarmTemplates%2Fportal-es-hubspoke.json) this solution to your Azure environment.
