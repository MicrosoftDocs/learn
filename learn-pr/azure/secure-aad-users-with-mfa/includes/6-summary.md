Using Azure AD Multi-Factor Authentication, you can ensure that when users sign in to access your confidential systems and data, they are who they say they are. Azure AD allows you to create policies to ensure that specific apps are protected, while allowing more public systems to remain easier to get to. In addition, you can leverage other services such as Azure AD Identity Protection and Azure Smart Lockout to fully protect your identity surface area.
