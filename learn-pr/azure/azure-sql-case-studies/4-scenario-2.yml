    title: "Knowledge check"
    questions:
    - content: "Which Azure SQL deployment option potentially offers the best fit for this scenario?"
      choices:
      - content: "SQL Server in an Azure virtual machine"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "This option doesn't readily provide an SLA that meets the requirements."
      - content: "Azure SQL Managed Instance"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "This option doesn't meet the SLA requirements."
      - content: "Azure SQL Database - single database"
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "Azure SQL Database is the only deployment option with a possible SLA of 99.995 percent. The customer can obtain that SLA by using the Business Critical service tier and enabling availability zones."
      - content: "Azure SQL Database - elastic pool"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "It's not clear from the scenario that an elastic pool is required."
    - content: "What is the best option for them to enable geo-redundancy and maintain high availability?"
      choices:
      - content: "Geo-replication"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Although geo-replication and auto-failover groups are both options here, auto-failover groups will enable the customer to fail over if it's required, without changing any connection strings. This setup can potentially help in reducing downtime to update applications, because it won't be needed. You can also configure monitoring queries to check the status. If something goes wrong, you can even force a failover."
      - content: "Auto-failover groups"
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "Although geo-replication and auto-failover groups are both options here, auto-failover groups will enable the customer to fail over if it's required, without changing any connection strings. This setup can potentially help in reducing downtime to update applications, because it won't be needed. You can also configure monitoring queries to check the status. If something goes wrong, you can even force a failover."
    - content: "What role does colocation play in your solution?"
      choices:
      - content: "It doesn't. We'll deploy to one region only."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Because you're using an auto-failover group, this answer doesn't make sense."
      - content: "Using the auto-failover group gives us what's needed."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Almost, but what happens to your application when you fail over?"
      - content: "In addition to the failover group, you need to deploy the application in both regions where the failover group exists."
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "You must make sure your application is deployed in both regions for the auto-failover group. This configuration will provide a redundant copy of the application. If there's a failover, you can use Traffic Manager to reroute traffic to the application in the secondary region."
    - content: "How can you ensure that DBAs can't see sensitive data stored in specific columns?"
      choices:
      - content: "SQL Audit"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "DBAs will still be able to see the data."
      - content: "Data Classification"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Now you have labeled sensitive data, but you can't track or prevent DBAs from seeing it with this option."
      - content: "Always Encrypted with role separation"
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "It's not possible to keep a db_owner from viewing user data with permission only. If highly sensitive data is in a database, you can use Always Encrypted to safely prevent even db_owners from seeing it. You can manage the Always Encrypted keys with role separation. The security admin doesn't access the database, and the DBA doesn't access the physical keys in plaintext. You can also use SQL Audit, Data Classification, and Dynamic Data Masking in combination to monitor."
      - content: "Dynamic Data Masking" 
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "It's not possible to keep a db_owner from viewing user data with Dynamic Data Masking."
    - content: "How can you track access to tables that contain sensitive data?"
      choices:
        - content: "SQL Audit and Data Classification"
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Use SQL Audit and Data Classification in combination. In the audit log, you can track access to sensitive data specifically, and you can view information such as the data that was accessed and its sensitivity label."
        - content: "Data Classification and Dynamic Data Masking"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "This configuration will help you identify and mask sensitive data, but you won't be able to track it."
        - content: "SQL Audit and Dynamic Data Masking"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "This configuration will help you mask data and view audits, but you won't be able to see sensitive data that was accessed."
        - content: "SQL Audit only"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "This configuration will allow you to access log data, but you won't be able to see sensitive data that was accessed."
    - content: "How can you allow DBAs to troubleshoot performance via the Azure portal and SSMS, and create new contained database users with Azure AD principals?"
      choices:
        - content: "Azure AD groups" 
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Using groups alone won't really help the situation."
        - content: "Azure RBAC" 
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "This option will allow you to make DBAs part of the SQL Server Contributor role, but they won't be able to access data."
        - content: "Azure AD groups and Azure RBAC" 
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Almost, but the DBA group must have Azure AD admin rights on the logical server."
        - content: "None of the above" 
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "The answer is really a combination of the above plus a little more. Create an Azure AD group called SQL DBA for the DBAs on the respective instance. Then, assign the group to the Azure RBAC role of SQL Server Contributor. Finally, set the group to be the Azure AD admin on the logical server."
