    title: "Knowledge check"
    questions:
    - content: "Which Azure SQL deployment option potentially offers the best fit for this scenario?"
      choices:
      - content: "SQL Server in an Azure virtual machine."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "While this would technically work, a PaaS offering may be a better fit and less management overhead."
      - content: "Azure SQL Managed Instance"
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "Since the customer is using CLR, which is an instance-scoped feature, Azure SQL Managed Instance will allow them to move to a PaaS offering without having to rewrite the CLR applications."
      - content: "Azure SQL Database - single database"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Hint: Consider their need for CLR."
      - content: "Azure SQL Database - elastic pool"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "There's no indication from the information provided that many databases or a pooling system would be necessary. Hint: Consider their need for CLR"
    - content: "How will they scale over multiple regions with multiple queries happening at the same time, while isolating read workloads from write workloads?"
      choices:
      - content: "Select General purpose service tier and deploy auto-failover groups."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "While this solution will enable them to isolate read and write workloads, since the secondary server in the auto-failover group can be used as a read-only endpoint, they will not be able to isolate read and write workloads in the primary region. Is there a better option?"
      - content: "Select General purpose service tier and deploy geo-replication"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "They can leverage the geo-replicated database(s) as readable secondaries, and they can deploy multiple geo-replicated databases across the globe, including in their existing region. However, Azure SQL Managed Instance does not support geo-replication currently."
      - content: "Select Business critical service tier and deploy auto-failover groups."
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "The Business critical tier will enable them to get a readable secondary, and an auto-failover group can help them scale over two regions."
      - content: "Select Business critical service tier and deploy geo-replication."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "They can leverage the geo-replicated database(s) as readable secondaries, and they can deploy multiple geo-replicated databases across the globe, including in their existing region. However, geo-replication isn't currently available in Azure SQL Managed Instance."
    - content: "Which authentication method would you recommend for the application on an Azure VM?"
      choices:
      - content: "Azure AD authentication: integrated authentication."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Is there a password-less option available for Azure resources?"
      - content: "Azure AD authentication: client ID/certificate"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Is there a password-less option available for Azure resources?"
      - content: "Azure AD authentication: interactive with multi-factor authentication (MFA)."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Is there a password-less option available for Azure resources?"
      - content: "Azure AD authentication: managed identity."
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "Managed identities for Azure resources are, in general, the recommended form of password-less authentication for applications running on Azure virtual machines."
      - content: "SQL authentication: username and password."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Consider Azure AD."
    - content: "Which authentication method would you recommend for the application on a non-Azure machine?"
      choices:
      - content: "Azure AD authentication: integrated authentication."
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "Integrated authentication via Azure Active Directory is the recommended authentication method for apps running on domain-joined machines outside of Azure, assuming the domain has been federated with Azure Active Directory. Alternatively, you can create an application identity for your application in Azure Active Directory, associate a certificate with the application identity, and modify your application to acquire a token for Azure SQL Database by providing a client ID and a certificate. Although the certificate must contain a private key and it must be deployed on the machine, hosting your application, you at least avoid hardcoding an application secret in the application code or configuration (you will need to configure the app with the certificate thumbprint)."
      - content: "Azure AD authentication: client ID/certificate."
        isCorrect: false

      - content: "Azure AD authentication: interactive with multi-factor authentication (MFA)."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Not the best option for an application."
      - content: "Azure AD authentication: managed identity."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Not for an application outside of Azure."
      - content: "SQL authentication: username and password."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Consider Azure AD."
    - content: "Which authentication method would you recommend for SQL admin tools (SSMS, PowerShell) on a non-Azure machine?"
      choices:
      - content: "Azure AD authentication: integrated authentication."
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "You can eliminate the use passwords with SQL tools by using Azure AD-Integrated authentication, providing the tools run on a domain-joined machine and the domain has been federated with Azure Active Directory. If your environment does not meet the above pre-requisites for integrated authentication, it is recommended you use Azure AD interactive authentication with MFA, which most SQL tools support. "
      - content: "Azure AD authentication: client ID/certificate."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Is there a password-less option?"
      - content: "Azure AD authentication: interactive with multi-factor authentication (MFA)."

      - content: "Azure AD authentication: managed identity."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Available only for Azure resources."
      - content: "SQL authentication: username and password."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Consider Azure AD."
    - content: "Which authentication method would you recommend for the application on legacy application where you can't change the driver/connection string on a non-Azure machine?"
      choices:
      - content: "Azure AD authentication: integrated authentication."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Not possible for legacy applications that use old drivers and/or SQL authentication and cannot be modified."
      - content: "Azure AD authentication: client ID/certificate."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Not possible for legacy applications that use old drivers and/or SQL authentication and cannot be modified."
