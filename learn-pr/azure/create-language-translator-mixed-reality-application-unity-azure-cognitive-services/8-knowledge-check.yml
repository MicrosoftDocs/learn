    title: Knowledge check
    questions:
    - content: "If a mixed reality experience uses the Mixed Reality Toolkit and the Cognitive Services Speech SDK, the MRTK Speech Commands Start Behavior should be set to:"
      choices:
        - content: "Auto Start"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "By default, the MRTK Speech Commands are configured to start automatically when a Unity scene loads. Although this setting enables the user to use speech to manipulate holograms, this setting interferes with the Cognitive Services Speech SDK."
        - content: "Manual Start"
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "The MRTK Speech Commands must be configured to not interfere with the Cognitive Services Speech SDK unless manually enabled."
        - content: "Disabled"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "There are only two Start Behavior options: Auto Start and Manual Start."
    - content: "How can industry-specific or organization-specific terminology be included in speech translation?"
      choices:
        - content: "Using Custom Translator, a custom translation system can be trained and deployed through parallel documents or dictionary data."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Custom Translator enables developers to build customized neural machine translation (NMT) systems without the need for machine learning expertise."
        - content: "Including custom terminology in speech translation requires extensive machine learning expertise. As such, this feature isn't available."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Custom Translator enables developers to build customized neural machine translation (NMT) systems without the need for machine learning expertise."
        - content: "Using Custom Translator, a custom translation system can be trained and deployed by uploading recorded audio conversations."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Custom Translator accepts previously translated documents or data that's parallel at the document level."
    - content: "What is the purpose of the TranslationRecognizer object?"
      choices:
        - content: "The TranslationRecognizer object confirms that the user has given permission to access their microphone."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "The Start() method is used to confirm whether the user has granted microphone permission."
        - content: "The TranslationRecognizer object stores the subscription key and region for the Speech service resource."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "The subscription key and region are parameters of the SpeechTranslationConfig object."
        - content: "The TranslationRecognizer object is used to start speech recognition and return the speech translation."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "After speech recognition starts, the TranslationRecognizer object task returns the recognition text translated into the target language as a dictionary."
