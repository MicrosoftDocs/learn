  title: Enable reliable messaging for Big Data applications using Azure Event Hubs - Learn
  description: The insights gained from big data processing can be invaluable. You can detect fraudulent financial transactions, get real-time alerting from device telemetry, and so on. However, without a reliable means to process potentially millions of data messages per second, the value of such applications may be severely compromised. This module shows you how use Azure Event Hubs to reliably process high-volume data streams. You'll create and configure a new hub and then code applications to send/receive messages through the hub.
