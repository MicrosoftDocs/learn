Azure Event Hubs provides big data applications the capability to process large volumes of data. It can also scale out during exceptionally high-demand periods, as required. Azure Event Hubs decouples the sending and receiving of messages to manage the data processing. These features help eliminate the risk of overwhelming consumer application and data loss because of any unplanned interruptions.

In this module, you've seen how to deploy Azure Event Hubs as part of an event processing solution.

You learned how to:

- Use the Azure CLI commands to create an Event Hubs namespace and an event hub in that namespace.
- Configure sender and receiver applications to send and receive messages through the event hub.
- Use the Azure portal to view your event hub status and performance.
