  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:

  - content: "If a CDN doesn't have a copy of a user-requested file in an edge server at a Point of Presence (POP), what happens next?"
    choices:
    - content: "The edge server checks with other edge servers at the same POP. If the file is still not present, it then requests the file from the origin server, returns the file to the user and caches the file."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The edge server checks with other edge servers at the same POP. If the file is still not present, it then requests the file from the origin server, returns the file to the user and caches the file."
    - content: "The POP passes the request to the next closest POP."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "If the file isn't available from the POP requested, the file is requested directly from the origin server. It doesn't check with the next nearest POP."
    - content: "The POP replies with a File not Found message."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The edge server checks with other edge servers at the same POP. If the file is still not present, it then requests the file from the origin server, returns the file to the user and caches the file."

    choices:
    - content: "Ignore query strings"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Cache every unique URL is inefficient for caching queries that use unique query strings."
    - content: "Bypass caching for query strings"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Cache every unique URL is inefficient for caching queries that use unique query strings."
    - content: "Cache every unique URL"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Cache every unique URL is inefficient for caching queries that use unique query strings."
