Azure Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) can help reduce latency and improve performance for high-bandwidth content.

Imagine you're the web administrator for a global company that produces and delivers online training videos. Your users rate your videos well, and your company is expanding into new regions. You want to ensure you maintain your high ratings as you expand. If users experience slow page loads, or videos take a long time to start playing, your new target customers might rate your content poorly or not use your services at all.

Your site is hosted using Azure Blob storage's static website hosting feature. It's primarily static content that is only changed when new videos are published every few weeks. This approach helps manage costs while still enabling your site to scale as the business grows. You need to find a way to optimize the performance of your website and ensure your media assets, including large video files, download quickly and reliably.

## Learning Objectives

In this module, you will:

- Configure a static website, hosted in Azure blob storage, to work with a CDN.
- Verify content publishing, and content updating, through the CDN.
- Identify the main configuration issues to consider when deploying a static site with CDN.
- Manage CDN cache to control content update delivery and query string handling.

## Prerequisites

- Experience with building and deploying static websites.
- Familiarity with how web content is requested and delivered on the internet, including the basics of the Domain Name System (DNS).
