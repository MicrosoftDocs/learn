quiz:

  questions:
  
  - content: "What Azure role should be assigned to a team member reviewing Defender for IoT data in the Azure portal but not making any changes?"
    choices:
    - content: "Security Reader"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "The Security Reader role is the right level of access for a team member who only needs read-access to sensor data."
    - content: "Security Admin"
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: "Zero Trust least-priviledged access suggests that Security Admin permissions are too high for someone who needs only read access to the sensor data."
    - content: "Admin"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Zero Trust least-priviledged access suggests that Security Admin permissions are too high for someone who needs only read access to the sensor data."

  - content: "Suppose you have a group of Azure users who are onboarding OT sensors. What Azure role should you give this group?"
    choices:
    - content: "Security Reader" 
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "A Security Reader user presumably has read-only access to sensor data in Azure, which isn't enough to onboard OT sensors."
    - content: "Security Admin"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "A Security Admin user has sensor onboarding permissions but still has permission limits."
    - content: "Owner"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "An Owner user presumably has all permissions and can create users. Creating users exceeds the permissions needed by the onboarding users."
