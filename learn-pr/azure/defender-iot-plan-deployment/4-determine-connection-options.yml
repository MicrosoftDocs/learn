quiz:

  questions:
  
  - content: "What advantage does a cloud connection provide for on-premises sensors?"
    choices:
    - content: "Sensor detected data is delivered to Azure for analysis and sharing."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Connecting to the cloud allows you to deliver sensor data to Azure for analysis and sharing, and to receive Microsoft threat intelligence package updates automatically."
    - content: "Sensor detected data is delivered to an on-premises management console for analysis and sharing."
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: "Cloud connected sensors don't use an on-premises management console for centralized analysis and sharing."
    - content: "Sensor data is isolated from the network and viewed from the sensor console."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Connecting to the cloud isn't an air-gapped solution. Sensor data isn't isolated from the network."

  - content: "If you have a cloud connection that requires a private connection between your sensor and Azure, which type of connection should you choose?"
    choices:
    - content: "Multicloud connection" 
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "A multicloud connection is used when you have sensors hosted in multiple public clouds."
    - content: "Proxy connection with an Azure proxy"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "When you need a private connection between your sensor and Azure, you can connect through a proxy in the Azure virtual network."
    - content: "Proxy connections with proxy chaining"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Proxy chaining allows you to connect your sensors through multiple proxies."
