Getting the timing right of heading to the bus stop is a challenge that most can relate to. Azure Functions can help in getting real-time data and triggering other events like stored procedures in Azure SQL Database and Azure Logic Apps that send notifications via Outlook.

In the language of your choice (Node.js, Python, or .NET), you used an Azure Function that adds real-time data to an Azure SQL Database and triggers an Azure Logic App for notifications when a bus enters a geofence. You also used GitHub Actions for CI/CD.

Overall, you learned how to create and deploy serverless APIs that manage application logic easily and scale automatically based on demand. You also learned the power of Azure SQL Database when it comes to processing JSON data and executing stored procedures. Finally, you learned how to deploy and configure Azure Logic Apps for orchestration or low-code/no-code tasks.

If you continue in the learning path, the next module will cover creating a web application to serve the data on an interactive map, allowing users to see their geofences and the buses on monitored routes nearby. The module will use Azure Static Web Apps, which combines the power of Azure App Service with Azure Functions.
