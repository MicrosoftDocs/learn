Azure Functions is an event-driven, serverless compute platform that solves complex orchestration problems.

Suppose you work for the transportation department of a major city and you want to increase the number of bus riders. To make it convenient to jump on the bus, you want to build a web app that allows users to monitor a bus’s progress along its route. By providing up to the second information on the whereabouts of the next bus along the route, you can help potential riders eliminate the situation where they either end up waiting for the bus or running to catch the bus and missing it. You also want to give users the option to get notified when a bus they want to take is nearby.

Throughout this module and the associated learning path, you'll follow the scenario (and the development of a solution) of catching the bus. There's a complete learning path dedicated to exploring each piece of the architecture below. In this module, you'll deploy an Azure Function that adds real-time data to an Azure SQL Database and triggers an Azure Logic App for notifications when a bus enters a geofence. You'll also use GitHub Actions for CI/CD.

By the end of the module, you'll be able to deploy Azure Function Apps in any language and integrate them with Azure SQL Database and Azure Logic Apps. You'll learn how to build backend APIs with Azure Functions and how services like Azure SQL Database and Azure Logic Apps can help in easing development.

## Learning objectives

By the end of the module, you'll be able to:

- Build and deploy serverless, backend APIs in Azure.
- Design Azure Functions in any language and integrate them with Azure SQL Database and Azure Logic Apps.

## Pre-requisites

- Ability to navigate the Azure portal
- Familiarity with Visual Studio Code
- Familiarity with CI/CD concepts such as GitHub Actions
