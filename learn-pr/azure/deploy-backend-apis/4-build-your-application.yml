    title: Knowledge check
    questions:
    - content: "How is the latest bus data acquired?"
      choices:
      - content: "Azure SQL Database pulls the latest bus data using a stored procedure"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Bus data is added to Azure SQL Database using a stored procedure, but that's not how the data is fetched."
      - content: "An Azure Logic App pulls the latest bus data using a trigger"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Azure Logic Apps is called after bus data is received and only for buses activating a geofence."
      - content: "Azure Functions pulls the latest bus data using an HTTP request"
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "That's correct!"
      - content: "All of the above"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Only one of the above statements is true."
    - content: "How does Azure SQL Database play in to this scenario?"
      choices:
      - content: "Azure SQL Database is used for JSON and geospatial processing, which makes storing data and identifying activating buses a simple task"
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "This statement is true. For example, the stored procedure uses `STContains` to easily identify which buses are in a geofence. "
      - content: "Azure SQL Database is used to execute Azure Functions"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "This statement isn't true, review the scenario again."
      - content: "Azure SQL Database is only used for storing data, because it doesn't support JSON data"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "This statement is false, Azure SQL Database supports JSON."
      - content: "Azure SQL Database is only used for storing data, because it doesn't support geospatial data"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "This statement is false, Azure SQL Database supports geospatial data."
