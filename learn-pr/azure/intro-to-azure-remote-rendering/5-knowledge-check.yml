quiz:
  questions:
  - content: "What is decimation?"
    choices:
    - content: "Decimation is a process that transforms a 3D model into a format ready to be used by Azure Remote Rendering."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Decimation doesn't transform 3D models for Azure Remote Rendering."
    - content: "Decimation improves the quality of a model for rendering on an untethered device."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. When a model is decimated, the rendering quality is diminished."
    - content: "Decimation compresses a model and removes polygons. Decimated models aren't rendered with full detail."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Decimation reduces the quality of a model, which means it's not rendered in full detail."
  - content: "Which of the following features of Azure Remote Rendering enables a user to combine local and remotely rendered elements in a single, unified 3D model?"
    choices:
    - content: "Remote rendering"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Remote rendering enables devices to render complex, high-polygon count 3D models."
    - content: "Familiar interactions"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The Familiar interactions feature enables you to interact with remote objects in the same way you do with local objects."
    - content: "Hybrid rendering"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Hybrid rendering enables you to merge local and remotely rendered content."
  - content: "An automotive engineer is working on a 3D model in HoloLens 2. The engineer notices that the rendering lacks the quality they observed last time the model was rendered. Which of the following rendering modes would offer better rendering?"
    choices:
    - content: "TileBasedComposition mode"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The rendering quality in TileBasedComposition mode is slightly better than in DepthBasedComposition mode."
    - content: "DepthBasedComposition mode"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The rendering quality in DepthBasedComposition mode is slightly worse than in TileBasedComposition mode."
  - content: "A customer is considering implementing Azure Remote Rendering. They mostly render 3D models of their products for training purposes. The models aren't large or visually complex. Would Azure Remote Rendering be indicated for this client?"
    choices:
    - content: "Yes, it's essential the client uses Azure Remote Rendering."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The models are relatively simple and fairly small. Local rendering might be suitable."
    - content: "No, the client should render their 3D models locally."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. We don't know what devices are available locally, nor whether local processing would be sufficient for the client's needs."
    - content: "It depends on other factors such as the ability to process locally, the type of local device, and whether there's a high-bandwidth, low-latency internet connection. "
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. You need more information to answer the question with confidence."
  - content: "Which of the following options describes an advantage of Azure Remote Rendering?"
    choices:
    - content: "Azure Remote Rendering reduces the need for decimation when rendering complex 3D models."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. This benefit is the primary advantage of Azure Remote Rendering."
    - content: "Azure Remote Rendering reduces visual fidelity to enable users to work with larger 3D models."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Azure Remote Rendering provides additional, high-end GPUs to handle the processing required to render complex models without reducing visual fidelity."
    - content: "A user can change the server size after launching a lease request if they require additional resources for rendering."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. You cannot change sizing after you launch an Azure Remote Rendering lease request."
