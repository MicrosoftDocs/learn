quiz:
  questions:
  - content: "To register and scan a data source hosted in an Azure SQL database, it's necessary to connect to the Azure SQL Database during the initial configuration. Which one of the following settings is necessary so the Azure SQL Database can be registered in Microsoft Purview?"
    choices:
    - content: "Allow Azure services and resources to access the server."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. If public access is disabled on an Azure SQL Database, one option is to select **Allow Azure services and resources** so the Microsoft Purview account can access the server to register and scan the data source."
    - content: "Install self-hosted integration runtime on the Azure SQL Database."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Self-hosted integration runtime can be set up on a separate VM in the virtual network that's integrated with the Azure SQL Database that uses a private endpoint."
    - content: "Create a firewall rule on the Microsoft Purview account to open the **1433 TCP** port."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Microsoft Purview is a managed service and can integrate data sources by using private or public endpoints. Individual firewall rules can't be set up on a Microsoft Purview account."
  - content: "Which of the following authentication methods can be used to authenticate and scan an Azure SQL Managed Instance?"
    choices:
    - content: "Windows integrated authentication"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Windows integrated authentication can't be used to set up proper credentials for authenticating the Azure SQL Managed Instance."
    - content: "SQL authentication"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. SQL authentication can be configured for a credential object used to scan the data source for an Azure SQL Managed Instance."
    - content: "Authentication using an Azure AD user."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Authentication using a user from Azure AD can't be used to set up proper credentials for authenticating the Azure SQL Managed Instance."
  - content: "To govern the Azure SQL Database that's integrated using a private endpoint with a virtual network, the decision is made to use self-hosted integration runtime. Where can the self-hosted integration runtime be deployed?"
    choices:
    - content: "As a container instance"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Self-hosted integration runtime can't be deployed as a container instance."
    - content: "In an Azure VM"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "A self-hosted integration runtime can be deployed in any Azure VM residing in Azure virtual network as long as there's a peering or virtual private network (VPN) between the self-hosted integration runtime VM and data sources and purview private endpoints."
    - content: "In Azure AD"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Azure AD is the Microsoft enterprise identity and access management solution for the cloud and isn't the correct location to deploy the self-hosted integration runtime."
