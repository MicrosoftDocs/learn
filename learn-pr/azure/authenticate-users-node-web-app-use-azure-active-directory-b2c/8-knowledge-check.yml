quiz:
  questions:
  - content: "How should one prepare Azure AD B2C to authenticate users into a Node web application?"
    choices:
    - content: "Use MSAL Node library when configuring the Node web application to communicate with Azure AD B2C."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. MSAL Node library is only a way of communicating with Azure AD B2C. One can still make HTTP calls and handle responses from Azure AD B2C instead of using MSAL Node."
    - content: "Register a web application and create a user flow in Azure AD B2C tenant."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. App registration establishes a trust relationship between the Node web app and Azure AD B2C. One also needs to create a user flow, which model user journeys."
    - content: "Enable ID token implicit grant settings Azure AD B2C tenant."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Implicit grant settings are only enabled when one needs to test user flows in Azure portal."
  - content: "Why is it advisable to use Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL) to configure authentication in a web app?"
    choices:
    - content: "MSAL handles the protocol details, so one needs a few lines of code to configure authentication."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. One doesn't need to implement protocol specifications while using MSAL. Protocol details have been implemented by MSAL, so one only needs to call functions to complete tasks."
    - content: "Using MSAL enables one to obtain both ID token and access token."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Although one can obtain both ID token and access token while using MSAL, it isn't the reason why MSAL is recommended. In fact, one can obtain either of the tokens by making an HTTP call directly to Azure AD B2C."
    - content: "Using MSAL is the only way to differentiate between a confidential and a public client app."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. It's not MSAL that differentiates between confidential and a public client app. MSAL only implements the definition of what's called a confidential or public client app."
  - content: "What does a web app receive back as a final response, when it makes a request to Azure AD B2C to authenticate users?"
    choices:
    - content: "Authorization URL."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The authorization URL is used to request the authorization code by requesting user's credentials and consent, and it's never the final response to the web app."
    - content: "A user's session ID."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. It's the web app that creates a session once it receives application claims from Azure AD B2C."
    - content: "ID token."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. On successful authentication, the web app receives an ID token (includes application claims) to use it to identify the user."
