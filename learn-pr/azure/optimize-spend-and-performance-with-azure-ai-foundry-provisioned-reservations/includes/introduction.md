Select Azure AI Foundry Models include provisioned deployments, also known as provisioned throughput units (PTUs), that allow you to specify the amount of throughput you require in your AI deployment. Additionally, you can save costs on these PTUs with Azure AI Foundry Provisioned Throughput reservations.

## Example scenario

Contoso Retail, a mid-sized retail company, wants to enhance customer support by implementing an AI-powered agent that can manage common customer inquiries, provide product recommendations, and assist with order tracking. Contoso Retail wants to design its agent to be highly available, have low latency, and provide predictable performance while managing costs effectively. For these reasons, they decided to use Azure OpenAI gpt 4o as the core model for their agent. You work as an Azure administrator for Contoso Retail. You're tasked with recommending an appropriate solution to allocate resources for agent deployment using the gpt 4o model.

## What will we learn?

In this module, you learn how to efficiently allocate and use resources needed for Azure AI Foundry model deployment. You review the various Azure AI Foundry deployment models and understand how to request and deploy PTUs. You also learn how to select and purchase the appropriate Azure AI Foundry Provisioned Throughput reservation based on your organization's requirements. Finally, you examine how to manage and monitor the reservations.

## What is the main goal?

By the end of this module, you'll be able to design and use the Azure AI Foundry with PTUs. You'll be able to identify the appropriate reservations for your organization, and understand the procedures for deploying, monitoring, and managing the provisioned reservations.
