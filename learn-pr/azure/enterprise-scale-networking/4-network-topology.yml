  questions:

  - content: "Contoso is deploying a network solution in Azure. It needs to deploy a solution in a single Azure region, and it needs to connect about 500 branch offices via VPN, and one main office via ExpressRoute. Contoso plans to deploy about 500 VMs across 50 virtual networks. Azure Firewall must protect the following traffic: virtual network to virtual network, virtual network to internet, branch to virtual network, and main office to virtual network. Contoso also wants to minimize cost and complexity. Contoso should do which of the following?"
    choices:
    - content: 'Implement a hub-and-spoke network.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "A hub-and-spoke network doesn't meet the requirements for firewall and branch-office connectivity."
    - content: 'Implement Virtual WAN with secured hubs (Azure Firewall).'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: 'Virtual WAN is the preferred solution because of the branch-office connectivity needs and the capability of secure hubs.'
    - content: 'Use only one large virtual network. Deploy Azure Firewall into that virtual network and all services for that region.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This solution doesn't meet the connectivity requirements for branch offices."
    - content: 'Deploy Virtual WAN.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Virtual WAN is part of the solution but doesn't meet the firewall requirement."

  - content: 'Contoso is creating its global connectivity subscription to support Azure services across six regions globally in the US, Europe, Australia, and India. Contoso plans to mostly use PaaS services with Private Link but also about 3,000 virtual machines per region. Contoso has small colocation facilities and datacenters in 20 countries/regions on every populated continent. Contoso currently uses multiple MPLS networks from three providers for datacenter and large office connectivity. Contoso requires firewalls for all traffic moving between on-premises and Azure, and it needs to minimize latency for these connections. Contoso has many applications that need to communicate across Azure regions and cross-premises. Contoso also wants to minimize cost and complexity. Contoso should:'
    choices:
    - content: 'Implement a hub-and-spoke network, with Azure Firewall in the hubs and a hub in each of the six Azure regions.'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: 'A hub-and-spoke network allows for more than 2,000 VMs per region, which is a current limitation of Virtual WAN.'
    - content: 'Implement Virtual WAN with secured hubs (Azure Firewall) in each of the six Azure regions.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'A hub-and-spoke network allows for more than 2,000 VMs per region, which is a current limitation of Virtual WAN.'
    - content: 'Use only one large virtual network in each region. Deploy Azure Firewall into that virtual network and all services for that region.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'This solution technically works but is too expensive and complex.'
    - content: 'Deploy Virtual WAN.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Virtual WAN is part of the solution, but it doesn't meet the firewall requirement and has a limit of 2,000 VMs per region."
