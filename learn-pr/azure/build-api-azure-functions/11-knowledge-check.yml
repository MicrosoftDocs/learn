  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
    - content: "What do you need to do in an Azure Function to make it an HTTP endpoint?"
      choices:
        - content: "Name the main file 'index'."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "The name 'index' is the default for all types of Azure Functions."
        - content: "Add a CONNECTION_STRING property to the 'local.settings.json' file."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Adding an app setting won't make an Azure Function respond to an HTTP request."
        - content: "Azure Functions are accessible over HTTP by default."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Azure Functions have to have a default trigger type specified."
        - content: "Select the 'HTTP Trigger' template when creating a function."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "The 'HTTP Trigger' template lets Azure Functions know that a function should be exposed as an HTTP endpoint."
    - content: "What is the RESTful way to handle a delete product action in your API?"
      choices:
        - content: "Set the URL to /products, pass the ID of the item in the request body and use an HTTP DELETE method."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Parameters can be passed on the body, but it's not the best way to pass a single parameter like an 'ID'."
        - content: "Set the URL to /products, pass in the ID of the item as a URL parameter (products/1) and set the HTTP method to POST."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "The 'POST' method is used for create operations, not deletes."
        - content: "Set the URL to /delete, pass in the ID of the item as a URL parameter (products/1) and set the HTTP method to DELETE."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "The URL should be set to the resource name, not the name of the action to be performed."
        - content: "Set the URL to /products, pass in the ID of the item as a URL parameter (products/1) and set the HTTP method to DELETE."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "A RESTful URL is organized by resource name (products), parameters are passed as part of the URL and the correct HTTP method for a delete operation is DELETE. "
    - content: "How do you specify app settings for an Azure Functions project?"
      choices:
        - content: "In the package.json file."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "The app settings for an Azure Functions project are not found in the package.json file."
        - content: "Azure Functions will automatically read settings from a local.settings.json file."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Azure Functions relies on a file called local.settings.json. Any settings added to that file will be available as app settings."
        - content: "Specify them on the process.env object."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "The process.env object is populated from values in the local.settings.json file."
        - content: "In the env.development file"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Azure Functions does not use an env.development file."
