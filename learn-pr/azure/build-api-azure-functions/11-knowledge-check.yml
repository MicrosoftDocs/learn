  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
    - content: "What do you need to do to make a function an HTTP endpoint?"
      choices:
        - content: "Name the main file `index`."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "The name `index` is the default for all types of Azure Functions."
        - content: "Add a CONNECTION_STRING property to the local.settings.json file."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Adding an app setting doesn't make an Azure Function respond to an HTTP request."
        - content: "All functions are accessible by default as HTTP endpoints."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "There are many types of triggers in Azure Functions, but only HTTP triggers are called by HTTP requests."
        - content: "Select the `HTTP Trigger` template when creating the function."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "The 'HTTP Trigger' template is used to create a function that exposes an HTTP endpoint."
    - content: "What is the RESTful way to handle a delete product action in your API?"
      choices:
        - content: "Set the URL to `/products`, pass the ID of the item in the request body and use an HTTP `DELETE` method."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Parameters can be passed on the body, but it's not the best way to pass a single parameter like an ID."
        - content: "Set the URL to `/products`, pass in the ID of the item as a URL parameter (`products/1`) and set the HTTP method to `POST`."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "The `POST` method is used for create operations, not deletes."
        - content: "Set the URL to `/delete`, pass in the ID of the item as a URL parameter (`products/1`) and set the HTTP method to `DELETE`."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "The URL should be set to the resource name, not the name of the action to be performed."
        - content: "Set the URL to `/products`, pass in the ID of the item as a URL parameter (`products/1`) and set the HTTP method to `DELETE`."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "A RESTful URL is organized by resource name (products), parameters are passed as part of the URL and the correct HTTP method for a delete operation is DELETE. "
    - content: "How do you specify app settings for a local Azure Functions project?"
      choices:
        - content: "In the package.json file."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "The app settings for an Azure Functions project aren't found in the package.json file."
        - content: "Azure Functions reads app settings from the local.settings.json file."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Azure Functions relies on a file called local.settings.json. Any settings added to that file are available as environment variables."
        - content: "Specify them on the process.env object."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "The process.env object is populated from values in the local.settings.json file."
        - content: "In the env.development file"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Azure Functions doesn't use an env.development file."
