Suppose you're the lead developer for a company that manufactures studio and performance equipment for musicians. Your company maintains a library of product manuals in Azure Storage. Manuals for your company's newest products are frequently accessed, but the manuals for older products are less likely to be viewed. However, your company needs to maintain all of its manuals online so that customers using your company's legacy products can still find the information they need. Your job is to configure the correct storage tiers for your company's product-manual library in order to optimize your company's costs.

In this module, you'll learn about using storage tiers to help manage data saved to Azure Storage and compare the various methods you can use to access and modify these tiers. You'll assign the appropriate level to stored data, and you'll use both Azure tools and a basic ASP.NET Core app to manage your storage tiers.

- Describe the key features of each Azure Blob Storage tier.
- Determine appropriate use cases for each storage tier.
- Use tools and code to configure the storage tier for resources in Azure Storage.
