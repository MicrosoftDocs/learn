  questions:
  - content: "You want to simplify the process of deploying Azure CycleCloud and configuring its access to your Azure subscription. What should you do?"
    choices:
    - content: "Deploy Azure CycleCloud by using the Azure Marketplace image and enable system-assigned managed identity."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Using the Azure Marketplace-based image and enabling system assigned managed identity, follow the Microsoft recommendations and simplify the process of deploying Azure CycleCloud and configuring its access to the target Azure subscription."
    - content: "Deploy containerized Azure CycleCloud by using an image from the Microsoft Container Registry and configure a service principal."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "While using a container to run Azure CycleCloud is an option, using a service principal introduces management overhead."
    - content: "Deploy Azure CycleCloud to your on-premises server and use Active Directory Domain Services-based authentication."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This approach increases management overhead. More importantly, AD DS-based authentication isn't supported in this scenario."
  - content: "You've installed Azure CycleCloud on an Azure VM and deployed your first cluster by using the web interface. Now you want to automate provisioning of an Azure CycleCloud-managed cluster based on an existing template. What should you do first?"
    choices:

    - content: "Create an Azure Storage account."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This step is already completed, because you successfully installed and configured Azure CycleCloud."
    - content: "Install Azure CycleCloud CLI."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Azure CycleCloud CLI facilitates automation and integration of CycleCloud into existing workflows."
  - content: "You've deployed Azure CycleCloud. You want to provision a cluster based on an Azure CycleCloud template available from GitHub. What should you do?"
    choices:
    - content: "Use Azure CycleCloud CLI to import the template."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Azure CycleCloud CLI allows you to provision a cluster by importing the corresponding template."
    - content: "Use Azure Resource Manager to deploy the template."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This method allows you to deploy Azure resources based on an ARM template."
    - content: "Use Azure CLI to deploy the template."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This method allows you to deploy Azure resources based on an ARM template."
