      explanation: "Incorrect. Azure Managed Disks store block-level volumes to be used as virtual disks for Virtual Machines (VMs). You can't use it to store and serve videos."
  - content: "Your developers created a web app that consists of five virtual machines and a NoSQL database. You want to create and manage all these resources as a single unit in your Azure subscription. Which object should you create to group them?"
    choices:
    - content: "An Azure management group"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. In Azure, use management groups to associate all your Azure subscriptions. You can't use them to group resources."
    - content: "A Microsoft Entra ID security group"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Microsoft Entra ID security groups are used to assign security permissions to multiple security principals. You can't use them to group resources in Azure."
    - content: "An Azure resource group"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. In Azure, use resource groups to associate multiple resources into a single unit to make management easier."
  - content: "You have 10 members of your IT management team who should be able to administrator Virtual Machines (VMs) and Cosmos DB databases in your subscription. You want to assign these permissions and manage them efficiently. Which object should you use?"
    choices:
    - content: "A role-based access security (RBAC) role"
      isCorrect: true

      explanation: "Incorrect. Use Azure Policies to enforce governance rules over Azure resources. You can't use them to assign permissions to resources."
    - content: "An Azure resource group"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Azure resource groups associate resources into a single unit for easier administration. You can't use them to assign permissions to resources."
