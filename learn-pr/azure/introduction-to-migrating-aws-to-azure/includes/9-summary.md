When planning a transition from Amazon Web Services (AWS) to Azure it's helpful to understand what the equivalent services are on each platform, and where services differ. You need to know the differences in terminology, how Azure handles the tasks you're familiar with in AWS, and where to go to get more detailed information.

Throughout this module, you've been considering the scenario of two companies, using AWS and Azure, who consider migrating their cloud systems after a merger. You can now see how AWS services, such as Elastic Kubernetes Service or DynamoDB SimpleDB. Map to Azure services, such as Azure Kubernetes Service or Cosmos DB. However, migration isn't a simple lift-and-shift operation. You saw some of the differences in terminology and structure.

After completing this module, you can:

- Understand identity and access management (IAM) in Azure compared to AWS.
- Compare governance services on AWS with Azure.
- Understand the differences between AWS and Azure Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) options.
- Compare database services in AWS and Azure.
- Compare event driven architecture and messaging services in AWS and Azure.
- Compare Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) and Azure Kubernetes Services (AKS).
- Understand where to find more information about AWS equivalent Azure services.
