Not all models are simple mathematical equations that can be plotted as a line. Instead, it's easier to think of some complex models as more like flow charts or traditional programming structures. Such models usually have extra levels of customization available, which can make them more powerful, but also trickier to work with. This module explores this concept by manipulating how models work and how they're trained. Although we'll focus on one type of model, the general principles we cover here apply to many other model types as well.

## Scenario: Predicting sports results using machine learning

Throughout this module, we'll refer to the following example scenario as we explain concepts surrounding model architecture and hyperparameters. This scenario is designed to appear complex at first, but as the exercises progress, we'll learn how you can tackle it using a little critical thinking and experimentation.

The Olympic Games' motto consists of three Latin words: *Citius*, *Altius*, *Fortius*. These words mean *Faster, Higher, Stronger*. Since this motto was established, the variety of games has grown enormously to include shooting, sailing, and team sports. We'd like to explore the role that basic physical features still play in predicting who wins a medal at one of the most prestigious sporting events on the planet. To this end, we'll explore rhythmic gymnastics: a modern addition to the games that combines dance, gymnastics, and calisthenics. One might expect that basic characteristics of age, height, and weight play only a limited role, given the need for agility, flexibility, dexterity, and coordination. Let's use some more advanced machine learning models to see how critical these basic factors really are.

## Prerequisites

* Familiarity with machine learning models

## Learning objectives

In this module, you will:

* Discover new model types: decision trees and random forests.
* Learn how model architecture can affect performance.
* Practice working with hyperparameters to improve training effectiveness.
