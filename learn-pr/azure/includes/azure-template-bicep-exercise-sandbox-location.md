> You're specifying that the `location` parameter should be set to `westus3`. Normally, you would create resources in the same location as the resource group by using the `resourceGroup().location` property. But when you work with the Microsoft Learn sandbox, you need to use certain Azure regions that don't match the resource group's location.
