title: Design a health model for your mission-critical workload
summary: A well-designed application **health model** gives you contextualized observability by using metrics and thresholds, which _you_ consider important for your mission-critical workload.
abstract:  | 
  By the end of this module, you'll be able to:
  -	Identify user flows and key application components of an application architecture.
  -	Identify key metrics to use as the foundation of an application health model.
  - Build a layered health model for an application.
  -	Visualize the health model in a dashboard.
prerequisites: |
  - Extensive experience designing cloud-native applications that include core infrastructure technology like data storage, compute, and networking.
  - Good understanding of the design principles and design areas of a mission-critical workload in the Azure Well-Architected Framework.
  - Basic understanding of application or solution health modeling.
