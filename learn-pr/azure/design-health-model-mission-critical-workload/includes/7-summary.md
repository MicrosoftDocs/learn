In this module, you created the foundation of a health model for the defined architecture of an internal web application that supports the Contoso Shoes store website:

- You identified two user flows for Contoso Shoes: *List catalog items* and *Add comment*.
- You identified key application components and built a layered health model.
- You identified metrics and thresholds for individual components in the model.
- You learned about visualizing the health model in a dashboard and creating alerts.

Congratulations on completing this training module. You've learned how to design a health model and have applied this knowledge through the exercises to meet an organization's needs.
