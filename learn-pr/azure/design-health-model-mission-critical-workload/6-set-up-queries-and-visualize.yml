quiz:
  title: Knowledge check
  questions:
  - content: "Where should system components send their telemetry?"
    choices:
    - content: "A central data sink for logs and telemetry, which is common for global and regional resources."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Although central storage for all telemetry makes data easier to analyze, using a central data sink creates a single point of failure, which is unacceptable for mission-critical applications."
    - content: "A unified, stamp-based data store for logs and telemetry, in which each stamp and global tier has its own sink."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. A dedicated data sink that is shared on the global and stamp levels, is a good compromise for ease of access while eliminating a single point of failure."
    - content: "A decentralized data store, in which every Azure resource and every component has its own sink."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Splitting data sinks by resource is inefficient and creates unnecessary overhead for analysis."
  - content: "What language is used to query Log Analytics logs and calculate health scores?"
    choices:
    - content: "Structured Query Language (SQL)"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. SQL is commonly used in querying relational databases. Although the Log Analytics query format looks similar, it has a different syntax."
    - content: "Transact-SQL (T-SQL)"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. T-SQL is an extension of the SQL language and is used to interact with relational databases."
    - content: "Kusto Query Language (KQL)"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. KQL is used to query Log Analytic logs. It uses a hierarchy that's similar to SQL, but it has a different syntax."
  - content: "What's the best dashboard technology for health modeling?"
    choices:
    - content: "Dashboard technology is optimized for different purposes, so the best option for you depends on your needs."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Azure offers multiple options when it comes to using dashboards, and each can be suitable for a different purpose. The correct approach is to evaluate the visualization needs of the health model, and then choose a solution."
    - content: "Azure Dashboards"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Azure Dashboards is a suitable technology for using dashboards, but it might not fully support all necessary customizations."
    - content: "Azure Managed Grafana"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Azure Managed Grafana is a powerful dashboard technology that has rich customization options, but using it to build and manage the right visualization is more complex."
