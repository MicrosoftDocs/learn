Organizations build applications to serve various use cases. While most application developers are focused on implementing the business logic, there are also requirements to secure the access to the application. The responsibility of identity and access management requires additional expertise and comes with complexity.

Microsoft Entra ID and the Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL) simplify this. Microsoft Entra ID lets you handle these requirements by providing identity and access management (IAM) as a service. The Microsoft Authentication Library provides convenient APIs for developers to implement the authentication and authorization features in their applications.

## Example scenario

Imagine you're building a portal for employees in your company to access company information and helpful resources to perform their work. You need to ensure that this application is only accessible to users within your organization. You want to build a Java web application that signs in the employees with their work accounts and displays some information from their company profile.

Microsoft Entra ID allows you to secure your applications by signing in users with their organizational accounts. The Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL) provides various methods for developers to authenticate users and get authorized access to applications secured by Microsoft Entra ID.

## What will we be doing?

In this module, you will:

- Register a web application with Microsoft Entra ID.
- Sign in users in a Microsoft Entra tenant to a Java web application.
- Authorize access to data in a Microsoft API.

## What is the main goal?

The main goal is to learn how to secure your application with Microsoft Entra ID and use the Microsoft Authentication Library to sign in users and get authorized access to data in a Java web application.
