  questions:

  - content: "When creating a new Custom Vision Service project, what is a domain used for?"
    choices:
    - content: "Helps you decide what to name your project."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "You can name the project anything you want. The domain doesn't affect the name."
    - content: "Helps you decide how to structure your project."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Projects have the same structure in terms of training images and predictions; it does not vary based on domain choice."
    - content: "Optimizes the classifier for a specific image type."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "The domain gives the classifier more information about the expected content of the images."

  - content: "Why should you add a tag after uploading images?"
    choices:
    - content: "To help you organize your images in the project for later use"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "While tags do help organize images, that's not the full purpose of tags."
    - content: "To put the images in a category for training"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "The tags tell the classifier which characteristics apply to an image. For the image classification to work, you do need to add at least one tag."
    - content: "To generate a word cloud after training"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The Custom Vision Service doesn't create word clouds."

  - content: "What two values do you need to know in order to make a call to the Prediction API from client code?"
    choices:
    - content: "Prediction URL and Prediction Key"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "The URL identifies the endpoint for the connection and the Prediction Key authorizes your app to access the service."
    - content: "Service name and authentication token"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Neither of these values are related to the Prediction API."
    - content: "Client secret and redirect URI"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Neither of these values are related to the Prediction API."
