Contoso management wants to move more workloads to the cloud. At issue are potentially sensitive workloads like personnel systems and a line-of-business app that involves proprietary data. Moving these would be a big step, and the team wants to mitigate security risks and ensure virtual machine integrity.

Contoso wants an environment where VMs are resistant to tampering by unauthorized software or hackers trying to modify the disks/boot environment. Plus, Contoso wants to verify the data is protected across its entire lifecycle on Azure.  Contoso policy requires a zero-trust computing environment. You need to learn more about the Azure confidential computing portfolio. You also want to understand what approaches help you meet or exceed your security policy criteria for sensitive workloads you want to run in Azure.
