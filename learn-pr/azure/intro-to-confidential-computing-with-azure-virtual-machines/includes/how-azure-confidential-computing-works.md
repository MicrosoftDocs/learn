Two different CPU-related technologies in Azure help you achieve a high integrity virtual machine environment that's resistant to tampering and access from unauthorized software. 

- VMs with application enclaves
- VM-level confidentiality

Choose one or both technologies to protect your applications in virtual machines. Both options take advantage of recent CPU architecture improvements to enable memory encryption, CPU-state confidentiality, and data integrity. Both technologies are virtualization extensions, which are implemented by CPU manufacturers to allow a virtualized environment to access CPU resources directly rather than doing so through the host operating system and hypervisor. These extensions enable improved CPU and memory performance as well as better security of the virtual machine's operating system, applications, and data processing.

| **Technology** | **Supported virtual machines** | **Considerations** |
|---|---|---|
| [VMs with application enclaves](/azure/confidential-computing/application-development) | Confidential computing with application enclaves supports multiple VM sizes, including the following: _DCsv2 series_, _DCsv3 series_, and _DCdsv3 series_.<br><br>For a complete list, see [DCsv2-series](/azure/virtual-machines/dcv2-series) and [DCsv3 and DCdsv3-series](/azure/virtual-machines/dcv3-series). | Developers can build secure enclave-based applications to run in this series of VMs to protect application data and code in use. Supports multiple TEEs and enables line-of-code control on which resources can process data. |
| [VM-level confidentiality](/azure/confidential-computing/confidential-vm-overview) | Confidential VMs support multiple VM sizes, including the following: _DCasv5-series_, _DCadsv5-series_, _ECasv5-series_, and _ECadsv5-series_.<br><br>For a complete list, see [DCasv5 and DCadsv5-series](/azure/virtual-machines/dcasv5-dcadsv5-series) and [ECasv5 and ECadsv5-series](/azure/virtual-machines/ecasv5-ecadsv5-series). | Enable lift-and-shift of existing workloads and protect data from the cloud operator with VM-level confidentiality. Onboard easily and achieve VM confidentiality with a few clicks &mdash; no need to update or customize applications. |
