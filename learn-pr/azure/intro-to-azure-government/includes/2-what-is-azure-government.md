Azure Government is a cloud environment specifically built to meet compliance and security requirements for US government. This mission-critical cloud delivers  breakthrough innovation to U.S. government customers and their partners. Azure Government applies to government at any level — from state and local governments to federal agencies including Department of Defense agencies. 

While there are multiple cloud providers in the public sector, not many can offer the unique capabilities required by state and local and federal government agencies. Azure Government provides hybrid flexibility, deep security, and broad compliance coverage across regulatory standards.

The key difference between Microsoft Azure and Microsoft Azure Government is that Azure Government is a sovereign cloud. It's a physically separated instance of Azure, dedicated to U.S. government workloads only. It's built exclusively for government agencies and their solution providers.

Azure Government is designed for highly sensitive data, enabling government customers to safely transfer mission-critical workloads to the cloud.

     A **Physically separated** instance of Microsoft Azure.

     Microsoft Azure Government is a separate, physical instance of Azure. It has an advanced infrastructure with robust networking in eight announced regions across the United States. Those regions include two regions at DoD Impact Level 5. Azure Government also offers data replication across regions for business continuity. All are connected via private dark fiber.

     ExpressRoute provides choice and convenience when connecting between on-premises and virtual resources in the cloud and enables reliable connection for scenarios like data migration, disaster recovery, or other high-availability needs. ExpressRoute locations are in Chicago, Dallas, New York, Phoenix, San Antonio, Seattle, Silicon Valley, and Washington DC.

     Azure Government also features key networking services such as VNet service endpoints for storage and SQL and Network Watcher for more secure building of applications and monitoring.
