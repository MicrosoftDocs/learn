The Azure Government Marketplace helps connect government agencies and partners with independent software vendors (ISVs) and start-ups that are offering their solutions, optimized to run on Azure, in Azure Government. The Azure Government Marketplace includes many of the same solutions for the Azure Government environment. Here you’ll find everything from open-source container platforms to threat detection to blockchain. With the marketplace, you can provision end-to-end solutions quickly and reliably, hosted in your own Azure Government subscription — an isolated, trusted, and highly secured environment.

Azure Government Marketplace solutions are the same images you’ll find in Azure public, deployable to Azure Government, and discoverable in the Azure Government portal. As in global Azure, you can choose to deploy pre-built images from Microsoft and its partners, or upload your own virtual hard disks (VHDs). This flexibility enables you to deploy your own standardized images if needed.

## How are the Azure Government and Azure global Marketplaces different? 

The Azure Government Marketplace differs from Azure Marketplace in the following ways:
- Only Bring Your Own License (BYOL) and Pay-as-you-Go (PayGo) images are available.
- A different set of images is available. You can find the list of available images at [Azure Government Marketplace images](/azure/azure-government/documentation-government-image-gallery).

## How to find Azure Government Marketplace solutions

You can find Azure Government Marketplace solutions in two ways:
