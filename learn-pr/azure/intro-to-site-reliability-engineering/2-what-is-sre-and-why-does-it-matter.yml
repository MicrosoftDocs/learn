  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:

  - content: 'Which property of a service, system or product does SRE primarily focus on?'
    choices:
    - content: 'Security'
      isCorrect: false
      incorrectExplanation: 'Security is definitely important in SRE, but reliability is the primary focus of this engineering discipline.'
    - content: 'Cost to run'
      isCorrect: false
      incorrectExplanation: 'Expenses and resource usage are definitely important in SRE, but reliability is the primary focus of this engineering discipline.'
    - content: 'Reliability'
      isCorrect: true
      correctExplanation: 'SRE''s primary focus is indeed on reliability.'
    - content: 'Maintainability'
      isCorrect: false
      incorrectExplanation: 'The creation of maintainable services, systems or products is definitely important in SRE, but reliability is the primary focus of this engineering discipline.'

  - content: 'For almost all services, systems and products, what level of reliability does an SRE strive for?'
    choices:
    - content: '100% is the goal'
      isCorrect: false
      incorrectExplanation: 'For most contexts, it is not possible to hit 100% reliable. Even if it was, it would be cost and resource prohibitive (an as waste of both).'
    - content: 'It should be as reliable as possible'
      isCorrect: false
      incorrectExplanation: 'It is important to find the appropriate level of reliability for a goal since efforts and resources beyond that are a waste. Plus "as possible" is too vague to be useful.'
    - content: 'A specific level indentified as appropriate by the key stakeholders'
      isCorrect: true
      correctExplanation: 'Setting a goal for a service is a collaborative effort between SRE, development resources and the business decision makers.'
