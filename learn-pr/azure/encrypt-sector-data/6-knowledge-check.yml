  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "What prevents a customer from accessing another customer's secrets in Azure Key Vault?"
    choices:
    - content: "Data encryption at rest."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect.  Azure provides extensive options for data encryption at rest to help customers safeguard their data and meet their compliance needs using Microsoft-managed encryption keys and customer-managed encryption keys."
    - content: "Bring your own key capability."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. With Azure Key Vault, customers can import or generate encryption keys in HSMs, ensuring that keys never leave the HSM protection boundary. This protection supports bring your own key (BYOK) scenarios."
    - content: "Just-in-time (JIT) privileged access management system."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect.  Controls are in place to restrict insider access to production systems and customer data, including the Just-in-Time (JIT) privileged access management system."
    - content: "Microsoft Entra ID."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. To access encryption keys in Azure Key Vault HSMs, Microsoft Entra ID must authenticate all callers. Microsoft Entra authentication enforces tenant isolation and implements robust measures to prevent access by unauthorized parties, including Microsoft insiders."
  - content: "What protects connections between customer’s client systems and Microsoft cloud services by generating a unique session key for every session a customer initiates?"
    choices:
    - content: "In-transit encryption for VMs."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. In-transit encryption for VMs ensures data encryption in transit. Such as, Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) initiated from a client computer to Windows and Linux VMs to enable TLS protection for data in transit, and Secure Shell (SSH) for encrypted connections to Linux VMs running in Azure."
    - content: "Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS)."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. PFS protects connections between customer’s client systems and Microsoft cloud services by generating a unique session key for every session a customer initiates. PFS protects past sessions against potential future key compromises. This combination makes it more difficult to intercept and access data in transit."
    - content: "VPN encryption."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Customers can configure Azure VPN Gateway to use custom IPSec/IKE policy with specific cryptographic algorithms and key strengths instead of relying on the default Azure policies."
    - content: "ExpressRoute encryption."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Azure ExpressRoute provides several data encryption options, including MACsec that enables customers to store MACsec secrets in Azure Key Vault."
  - content: "What is a symmetric key stored in the database boot record for availability during recovery?"
    choices:
    - content: "Database Encryption Key (DEK)."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Database Encryption Key (DEK) is a symmetric key stored in the database boot record for availability during recovery. It’s secured via a certificate stored in the primary database of the server."
    - content: "Transparent Data Encryption (TDE)."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) performs real-time encryption and decryption operations on the data and log files."
    - content: "Key Encryption Key (KEK)."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Key Encryption Key (KEK) is an asymmetric key that’s optionally provided by the customer. This key is used to encrypt the Data Encryption Key (DEK) using Azure Key Vault and exists only in Azure Key Vault."
    - content: "Azure Disk Encryption (ADE)."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Azure Disk Encryption (ADE) may be used to encrypt all Azure Windows and Linux IaaS Virtual Machine disks. This encryption includes managed disks."
