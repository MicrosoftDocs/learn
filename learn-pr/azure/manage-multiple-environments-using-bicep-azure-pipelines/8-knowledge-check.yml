      When you try to run the pipeline, Azure Pipelines gives you an error. What's the most likely cause of the problem?
    choices:
    - content: The identifier of each stage isn't unique.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. Currently, both environments define a stage with the identifier *Deploy*. You should add the environment name into the stage identifier so that the identifiers are unique.
    - content: The `trigger` property is set to `none`.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: |
        Incorrect. `trigger: none` tells Azure Pipelines that you want to manually run the pipeline.
    - content: The `ubuntu-latest` agent pool name isn't valid.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. `ubuntu-latest` is a valid agent pool name.

      How can you improve the security of this pipeline?
    choices:
    - content: Use separate service connections for each environment.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. It's good security practice to use separate service connections and service principals to deploy to each environment.
    - content: Add a condition to deploy only when the environment name is `Production`.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. Your deployment pipeline needs to deploy to all environments, not just to production.
    - content: Create a new Azure role definition.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. You generally don't need to define custom Azure roles for your deployments. Custom roles don't help to resolve the issue that this pipeline uses a single credential to access multiple environments.

      You need to add a new environment named *Integration* to the pipeline. Which of these actions should you take as part of adding the new environment?
    choices:
    - content: Add a new pipeline file.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. When you're adding an environment to an existing pipeline, you don't need to add a new pipeline file.
    - content: Add a new pipeline template file.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. When you're adding an environment to an existing pipeline, you don't need to add a new template file.
    - content: Add a new Bicep parameters file.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. You need to create a new Bicep parameters file named *parameters.Integration.json* and commit it to your Git repository.

  - content: |
      You need to add a new parameter to your deployment that contains a connection string and password to access a database. Which of these approaches should you consider?
    choices:
    - content: Define a variable in the *azure-pipelines.yml* file.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. Pipeline definition files are committed to your Git repository, so they're not a secure location for secret values like passwords.
    - content: Define a variable group in the Azure Pipelines web interface and mark the variable as secret.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. Variable groups enable you to work with secret values.
    - content: Add the parameter to the *parameters.ENVIRONMENT_NAME.json* files.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. Bicep parameter files are committed to your Git repository, so they're not a secure location for secret values like passwords.
