  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: 'Which object provides a security context for an application registered in Microsoft Entra ID?'
    choices:
    - content: "managed identity"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Managed identities represent Azure resources, not applications registered in Microsoft Entra ID."
    - content: "service principal"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. A service principal provides authentication and authorization functionality and references the application object."
    - content: "user"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. User objects are used for interactive logons, rather than for applications registered in Microsoft Entra ID."
  - content: 'Which of the following steps helps ensure that an application registered in Microsoft Entra ID can act on behalf of a signed-in user when it accesses resources?'
    choices:
    - content: "Setting the application's redirect URI to http://localhost."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The application's redirect URI has no bearing on the application permissions."
    - content: "Configuring application permissions of the application."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Application permissions are used by apps that run without relying on a signed-in user, such as background services."
    - content: "Configuring delegated permissions of the application."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Delegated permissions are used by interactive apps with a signed-in user. As a result, the app acts on behalf of a signed-in user when it accesses the target resource."
  - content: 'Suppose a developer is creating a multitenant application for which the home tenant will be the Microsoft Entra tenant with the verified domain name of contoso.com. What should they configure as the sign-in request endpoint for the app?'
    choices:
    - content: 'login.microsoftonline.com/contoso.com'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This is the endpoint for a single-tenant app."
    - content: 'login.microsoftonline.com/contoso.onmicrosoft.com'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This is the endpoint for a single-tenant app."
    - content: 'login.microsoftonline.com/common'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. With a multitenant app, you can't determine ahead of time which tenant will be used, so you need to use the 'https://login.microsoftonline.com/common' endpoint, which serves all Azure AD tenants."
