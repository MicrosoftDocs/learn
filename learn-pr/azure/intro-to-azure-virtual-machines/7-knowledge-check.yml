  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: 'Suppose you want to run a network appliance on a virtual machine. Which workload option should you choose?'
    choices:
    - content: General purpose
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "General-purpose VMs are designed to have a balanced CPU-to-memory ratio that is not as suitable for network appliances as Compute optimized virtual machines, which are designed to have a high CPU-to-memory ratio."
    - content: Compute optimized
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Compute optimized virtual machines are designed to have a high CPU-to-memory ratio. Suitable for medium traffic web servers, network appliances, batch processes, and application servers."
    - content: Memory optimized
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Memory optimized VMs are designed to have a high memory-to-CPU ratio, which is great for relational database servers, but not as suitable for network appliances as Compute optimized virtual machines, which are designed to have a high CPU-to-memory ratio."
    - content: Storage optimized
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Storage optimized VMs are designed to have high disk throughput and IO, which is ideal for VMs running databases but not as suitable for network appliances as Compute optimized virtual machines, which are designed to have a high CPU-to-memory ratio."

  - content: 'True or false: Resource Manager templates are JSON files?'
    choices:
    - content: "True"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Resource Manager templates are JSON files that define the resources you need to deploy for your solution. The template can then be used to easily re-create multiple versions of your infrastructure, such as staging and production."
    - content: "False"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Resource Manager templates are JSON files that define the resources you need to deploy for your solution. The template can then be used to easily re-create multiple versions of your infrastructure, such as staging and production."
