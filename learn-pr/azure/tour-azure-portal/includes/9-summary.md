If you're a developer, Azure provides an easy way to test new platforms and build sophisticated apps. If you're an administrator, you can use the Azure portal, Azure CLI, or Azure PowerShell tools to administer your cloud-based infrastructure. If you're an architect, Azure allows you to test out new architecture ideas quickly.
