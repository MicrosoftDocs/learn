Azure is a cloud platform that provides the compute, storage, and networking resources needed to build cloud-hosted applications. As a new user, the Azure portal is likely to be the primary way to interact with Azure. The Azure portal lets you create and manage all your Azure resources. For example, you can set up a new database, increase the compute power of your virtual machines, and monitor your monthly costs. It's also a great learning tool since you can survey all available resources and use guided wizards to create the ones you need.

Here you will learn how to sign in to the portal and navigate the portal interface. You will also learn how to customize the dashboard so it is convenient to locate and monitor your most essential services.
