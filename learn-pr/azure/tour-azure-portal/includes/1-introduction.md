Azure is a cloud platform that provides the compute, storage, and networking resources needed to build cloud-hosted applications. As a new user, the Azure portal is likely to be the primary way you interact with Azure. The Azure portal lets you create and manage all your Azure resources. For example, you can set up a new database, increase the compute power of your virtual machines, and monitor your monthly costs. It's also a great learning tool since you can survey all available resources and use guided wizards to create new ones.

Here, you'll learn how to sign in to the portal and navigate the portal interface. You'll learn how to deploy new resources and explore preview features. You'll also learn how to customize the dashboard so it's convenient to locate and monitor your most essential services.
