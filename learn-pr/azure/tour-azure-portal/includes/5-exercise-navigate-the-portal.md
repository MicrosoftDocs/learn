Let's look at some of the more common areas you'll typically use in the Azure portal.

## All services

1. In the top left-hand corner of the Azure portal, select the **Show portal menu** icon.

1. Select **All services**. Take a minute to browse through the list to get an idea of how many services Azure offers. You can filter the services that appear by using the search box near the top of the pane.

1. Select **Virtual machines**. If you don't see it, use the search box.

1. The **Virtual machines** pane appears. You haven't created any virtual machines yet, so there are no results.

1. Select **+ Create** > **Azure virtual machine**. The **Create a virtual machine** pane appears.

1. To create a virtual machine, you could enter information here. For now, select the **X** in the top right-hand corner to close the **Create a virtual machine** pane.

1. Select the **X** in the top right-hand corner to close the **Virtual machines** pane.

1. Select **Microsoft Azure** on the top left-hand side to return to the **Home** page.

## Global controls

Find the global control menu at the top of the screen.

These options are always available in the portal, no matter what service you're using.

Hover over each icon until you see a tooltip pop up. These tooltips show the name of each menu item.

Next, we'll explore each of these items.

## Azure Cloud Shell

The Azure Cloud Shell is available in the Sandbox environment that we're using for this exercise, but the Sandbox version of the shell has reduced functionality. To explore all of the Azure Cloud Shell features, use your own Azure subscription.

1. Select the **Cloud Shell** (**>_**) icon in the toolbar. Azure Cloud Shell launches at the bottom of the screen.

1. Read the welcome menu that appears, then select either **Bash** or **PowerShell**.

1. Because we won't use the shell further in this exercise, select **Close**.

## Notifications

1. On the icon bar menu bar, select the **Notifications** (**bell**) icon. This window shows any notifications related to your account, such as confirming whether resources were deployed correctly.

## Settings

1. Select the **Settings** (gear) icon to open the **Portal settings** pane. The **Directories + subscriptions** section is shown by default. This is where you can apply subscription filters or change directories. We won't use this section for this exercise.

1. Select the **Signing out + notifications** tab at the left. In the **Sign me out when inactive** drop-down menu, select **After one hour**.

1. Select **Show pop-up notifications**. When this option is checked, notifications will appear as pop-up "toast"-style notifications. They'll still show up in the Notifications pane as well.

1. Select **Apply** to save your **Signing out + notifications** selections.

1. Select the **Appearance + startup views** tab at the left. Under **Theme**, select one of the different colored themes and select **Apply**. Observe the changes to the portal, and leave it set to the one you like the best.

1. Select the **Language + region** tab at the left. In the **Language** drop-down box, select **Español**. Select the **Apply** button, then select **OK** to confirm your changes. If a **Translate this page** dialog box appears, close the box. The whole Azure portal now appears in Spanish. You can select **Microsoft Azure** to view the **Home** page in Spanish, or navigate to other pages.

1. To revert back to English, select the **Settings** (gear) icon in the top menu bar, then select the **Idioma y región** tab at the left. In the **Idioma** drop-down box, select **English**. Select the **Aplicar** button, then select **Aceptar** to confirm. The portal will now appear in English again.

## Support + troubleshooting pane

1. Near the top of the pane, select **Create a support request**. Support requests can only be created using an active subscription. Creating support requests from a free Microsoft Learn sandbox is not supported, but you can click some of the steps on the **New support request** screen, such as **Problem description** and **Recommended solution**.

1. Because you aren't submitting a real support request, select **Home** in the top left corner. If you're prompted about unsaved edits, select **OK**.

1. Select the **Support + troubleshooting** (`?`) icon to reopen the pane, then select **Start again** to clear your previous entry.
