In this unit, you learn how to create and find different types of resources in the Azure portal.

## Activate the Azure sandbox

1. Start by selecting the **Activate sandbox** button at the top of this page.

1. Once it's activated, sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/learn.docs.microsoft.com?azure-portal=true). Make sure to use the same account with which you activated the sandbox.

## Explore how to create resources

Now let's start exploring how to create resources in Azure. We won't actually create any Azure resources in this exercise.

## Find resource types by category

1. On the home page, select **Create a resource**. The **Create a resource** pane appears, showing a sampling of **Popular Azure services** and **Popular Marketplace products**. Each of these sections includes links to see more offerings.

1. In the service menu, under **Categories**, select **Compute**. You now see only options related to this category in the **Popular Azure services** and **Popular Marketplace products** lists.

1. Next to the **Popular Marketplace products** headings, select **See more in Marketplace**. The full list of available **Compute** offerings appears.

1. In the **Operating Systems** section, select the option for **Windows Server**. If you don't see it, select **See more**. You can also select a different offering for this exercise.

1. Select the drop-down list under **Plan** to see all of the available Windows Server images.

1. Select the **X** at the top right-hand corner to close the **Windows Server** window.

1. Select the **X** on the previous **Marketplace** window.

## Use search to filter results

Another way to locate services from the **Create a resource** pane is to use search terms. Searching is often the quickest way to filter the services that you see.

The search box at the top of the **Create a resource** pane defaults to checking every Azure service category to get its results. You can also refine your search by selecting a category.

1. Start on the main **Create a resource** page. Type `virtual machine` into the **Search service** search box and select <kbd>Enter</kbd>. 

1. In the service menu, under **Categories**, select **Security**. You'll see a filtered list of virtual machine offerings that are related to security.

1. Select any of the results to learn more about that offering, including how to get started. Select the **X** in the corner to return to the list and explore a different offering. When you're done, move to the next step.

1. Select the **X** at the top right-hand corner to close the **Marketplace** pane. The **Create a resource** pane is visible once again.

1. Select the **X** at the top right-hand corner to close the **Create a resource** pane.

Many of the principles you learned in this exercise apply throughout the Azure portal experience. In the next unit, you continue your journey in the Azure portal and configure other settings in Azure.
