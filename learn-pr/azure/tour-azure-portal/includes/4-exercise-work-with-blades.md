In this unit, you will learn how to work with panes in the Azure portal user interface (UI).

## Activate the Azure sandbox

1. Start by **activating the Azure sandbox above**.

1. Once it's activated, sign into the [Azure portal for sandbox](https://portal.azure.com/learn.docs.microsoft.com?azure-portal=true). Make sure to use the same account you activated the sandbox with.

## Working with panes

Once you are logged into the Azure portal, we can start exploring things. In these sections, you will get a tour of the "panes" user interface element (windows within the Azure portal window), but you will not actually create any Azure resources.

1. Let's start by touring how to create a resource. In the left-hand portion of the portal, click **Create a resource** (or plus icon when collapsed).

1. A pane labeled **New** appears and displays a list of categories on the left-hand side, labeled Azure Marketplace. This initial view is somewhat like a "Popular Categories" menu, with some of the most common categories visible. If you'd like, you can expand this list to see everything in the **Marketplace** pane with the **See all** link next to the heading. If you do, you can get back to the New pane by clicking the X icon in the upper right of any panes you have opened.

1. Selecting any of items in the Azure Marketplace list will show popular services for that category on the right of the **New** pane. This list is a subset of the entire range of computing resources available for that category. As with the Azure Marketplace, you can click on the **See all** link for a more comprehensive list. We will talk more about this list in subsequent sections.

1. Returning to the **New** pane, click on **Get started** and you should see a list on the right side of the pane that includes services such as Windows Server 2016 VM, Ubuntu Server VM, SQL Database, and so on. Most of these items include a **Quickstart tutorial** link directly below the name. Clicking this link will open a new browser tab with the quickstart Microsoft documentation for that item, if you need it.

1. Optional: Click **Quickstart tutorial** under **Windows Server 2016 VM** and, in the new browser window, look through the Windows VM tutorials. When you are finished, close this new tab to return to the Azure portal.

## Viewing resources

1. Under Azure Marketplace, click **Compute** to show more compute options on the right side of the pane, such as Red Hat Enterprise, Reserved VM Instances, Web app for Containers, and so on.

1. To the right of **Featured**, click **See all**. The full list of available VM services now appears.

1. Click **Windows Server** under the **Operating Systems** section. On screens with limited horizontal space for the pane, you may have to scroll right and click the **See More** link to find the **Windows Server** option.

1. Select the drop-down list to see all of the Windows Server images available.

1. Click the **X** at the top right-hand corner to close the **Windows Server** window.

1. Click the **X** on the previous **Marketplace** window. You should now see the **New** pane again.

## Filtering results

Another way to locate services is to refine the list with filters and search terms. On the **New** pane, you may have noticed the search box at the top. Searching is the quickest way to filter what services you see.

This search defaults to checking every Azure service category to get its results. Next, you'll filter after selecting a category.

1. Type `virtual machine` into the search box and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.

1. Select **Compute**. You see a filtered list of Compute services related to virtual machine images.

1. Select any of the results that interest you to learn more about that service, including how to get started. Click the **X** in the corner to explore a different service. When you're done, move to the next step.

1. Click the **X** in the right-hand end of the search box. The **X** button will erase your search term but does not reset any of the drop-down filters you've set. You can either reset those filters manually, or close the **Compute** pane with the **X** icon in the upper right corner and reopen it. When you are finished trying out the search and filtering options, move on to the next step.

1. Click the **X** at the top right-hand corner to close the **Marketplace** pane. Now you will see the **New** pane once again.

1. Click the **X** at the top right-hand corner to close the **New** pane.

The default dashboard now appears.

Many of the principles you have learned in this exercise will apply throughout the Azure portal UI experience. In the next unit, you will continue your journey in the Azure portal and configure additional settings in Azure.
