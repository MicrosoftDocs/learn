In this unit, you'll learn how to work with panes in the Azure portal user interface (UI).

## Activate the Azure sandbox

1. Start by **activating the Azure sandbox above**.

1. Once it's activated, sign into the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/learn.docs.microsoft.com?azure-portal=true). Make sure to use the same account with which you activated the sandbox.

## Explore the Marketplace

Once you're logged into the Azure portal, we can start exploring things. In these sections, you'll get a tour of the Marketplace, but won't actually create any Azure resources.

1. Let's start by touring how to create a resource. On the home page, select **Create a resource**.

1. A pane labeled **Create a resource** appears. On the right-hand side, you'll see a list labeled **Popular Marketplace products**. You can expand this list to see everything in the **Marketplace** pane by selecting the **See more in Marketplace** link next to the heading. To return to the **Create a resource** pane, select the **X** icon in the upper right.

1. Returning to the **Create a resource** pane, look at the **Popular Azure services** list on the left side of the pane. This list includes services such as Virtual Machine, Kubernetes Service, Function App, and more. Many of these items include an **MS Learn** link directly below the name. This link opens a new browser tab with Microsoft Learn content for that service.

## View resources

1. In the left navigation pane, Under **Categories**, select **Compute** to show options related to this category in the **Popular Azure services** and **Popular Marketplace products** lists.

1. To the right of **Popular Marketplace products**, select **See more in Marketplace**. The full list of available VM services now appears.

1. In the **Featured** section, select the option for **Windows Server**. If you don't see it, select **See more**.

1. Select the drop-down list under **Plan** to see all of the Windows Server images available.

1. Select the **X** at the top right-hand corner to close the **Windows Server** window.

1. Select the **X** on the previous **Marketplace** window.

## Filter results

Another way to locate services from the **Create a resource** pane is to refine the list with filters and search terms. On the **Create a resource** pane, you may have noticed the search box at the top. Searching is the quickest way to filter what services you see.

This search defaults to checking every Azure service category to get its results. Next, you'll filter after selecting a category.

1. Type `virtual machine` into the search box and select <kbd>Enter</kbd>.

1. In the left navigation pane, under **Categories**, select **Compute**. You'll see a filtered list of Compute services related to virtual machine images.

1. Select any of the results that interest you to learn more about that service, including how to get started. Select the **X** in the corner to explore a different service. When you're done, move to the next step.

1. Select the **X** at the top right-hand corner to close the **Marketplace** pane. Now you will see the **Create a resource** pane once again.

1. Select the **X** at the top right-hand corner to close the **Create a resource** pane.

Many of the principles you have learned in this exercise apply throughout the Azure portal UI experience. In the next unit, you continue your journey in the Azure portal and configure additional settings in Azure.
