Microsoft offers previews of Azure features for evaluation purposes. With *Azure Preview Features*, you can try out prerelease features and services before they're rolled out to everyone.

Some common types of previews that you might see include:

- New storage types
- New Azure services, such as Machine Learning enhancements
- New or enhanced integration with other platforms
- New APIs for services

Azure feature previews are available under certain terms and conditions that are specific to each particular Azure preview. Some previews aren't covered by customer support.

Once a feature has been evaluated and tested successfully, it might be released to customers as part of Azure's default product set. This release is referred to as **General Availability** (GA).

## Find preview features

You can discover preview features through the [preview features page](https://azure.microsoft.com/updates/?status=inpreview&filters=%5B"In+preview"%5D?azure-portal=true). This page lists the preview features that are available for evaluation. To access a preview feature, select its entry on this page and learn more about how to evaluate it. You can also use the **RSS Feed** button on this page to subscribe to notifications and stay informed.

You can also find Azure preview features in the portal by searching for *Preview*, then selecting **Preview features**.

## Azure portal preview

You can also try out upcoming functionality for the portal as a whole. To do so, use the URL [https://preview.portal.azure.com](https://preview.portal.azure.com) (notice the **preview** prefix).

Portal preview features typically offer performance, navigation, and accessibility improvements to the Azure portal interface. When using the preview URL, the portal is branded with **Microsoft Azure (Preview)** in the top bar, so you can tell you're using the preview portal.

## Provide feedback on preview features

If you use the preview portal or a preview feature, Microsoft wants to hear about your experience. You can provide feedback by using the **Feedback** icon that you learned about earlier in this module.
