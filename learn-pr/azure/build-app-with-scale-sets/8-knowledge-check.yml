  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:

  - content: "What scaling option do you have when using virtual machine scale sets?"
    choices:
    - content: Only scheduled scaling, where you can proactively schedule the scale set to deploy one or more instances to accommodate a spike in traffic and then scale back down when the spike ends
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Automatic scaling (autoscaling) is also available when using virtual machine scale sets."
    - content: Only automatic scaling (autoscaling), where can use metric-based threshold scaling.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Scheduled scaling is also available when using virtual machine scale sets."
    - content: Both scheduled and automatic scaling.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Both scheduled and automatic scaling (autoscaling) are scaling options when using virtual machine scale sets."

  - content: "What is the primary feature virtual machine scale sets offer for application deployment?"
    choices:
    - content: Scaling
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Scaling is the main feature of virtual machine scale sets. You can scale via both scheduled scaling and automatic scaling (autoscaling)."
    - content: Eviction policies
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "While you can use eviction policies with virtual machine scale sets, scaling is the main offering of virtual machine scale sets."
    - content: Reduced costs
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "While virtual machine scale sets offer opportunities to reduce costs through Spot virtual machines, scaling is the main offering of virtual machine scale sets."

  - content: "What can custom script extensions be used for when using virtual machine scale sets?"
    choices:
    - content: You can only install applications on a virtual machine scale set using custom script extensions.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Custom script extensions can be used to both install and update applications across a scale set."
    - content: You can only update applications on a virtual machine scale set using custom script extensions.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Custom script extensions can be used to both install and update applications across a scale set."
    - content: You can both install and update applications on a virtual machine scale set using custom script extensions.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Custom script extensions can be used to both install and update applications across a scale set."
