In the shipping-company scenario, you installed a web application by creating the Virtual Machine Scale Set. You now need to update the web app and install a new version across all virtual machines (VMs) in the scale set.

You must ensure that the system remains available during the rollout. A good way to ensure availability is to use a custom script extension to do the update. Apply this script across the Virtual Machine Scale Set. The scale set applies the update to one virtual machine at a time, leaving the other VMs up and running.

In this exercise, you use a custom script extension to roll out a new version of the web app. Edit the message that the nginx server provides. You can use the same approach for bigger updates.

## Deploy the update by using a custom script extension

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), open the Cloud Shell and run the following command to view the current upgrade policy for the scale set:

    ```azurecli
    az vmss show \
      --name webServerScaleSet \
      --resource-group myResourceGroup \
      --query upgradePolicy.mode
    ```

    Verify that the upgrade policy is set to `Automatic`. You specified this policy when you created the scale set in the first lab. If the policy was `Manual`, you would apply any virtual machine changes by hand. Because the policy is `Automatic`, you can use the custom script extension and allow the scale set to do the update.

1. Run the following command to apply the update script:

    ```azurecli
    az vmss extension set \
      --publisher Microsoft.Azure.Extensions \
      --version 2.0 \
      --name CustomScript \
      --vmss-name webServerScaleSet \
      --resource-group myResourceGroup \
      --settings "{\"commandToExecute\": \"echo This is the updated app installed on the Virtual Machine Scale Set ! > /var/www/html/index.html\"}"
    ```

## Test the updated web application

1. Run the following command to retrieve the IP address of the load balancer for the scale set:

    ```azurecli
    az network public-ip show \
      --name webServerScaleSetLBPublicIP \
      --resource-group myResourceGroup \
      --output tsv \
      --query ipAddress
    ```

1. In your web browser, go to the public address of the scale set load balancer. Verify that you see the message **This is the updated app installed on the Virtual Machine Scale Set !**.
