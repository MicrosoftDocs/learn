  questions:
  - content: "Which of these statements best describes autoscaling?"
    choices:
    - content: "Autoscaling is a scale-up/scale-down solution. It migrates an application to more powerful hardware during periods of high demand, and moves the application back to less powerful hardware when demand drops."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Autoscaling is a scale-out/scale-in solution. It adds and removes instances of resources rather than migrating an application to and from more powerful hardware."
    - content: "Autoscaling requires an administrator to actively monitor the workload on a system. If the workload increases and response times start to drop, the administrator can trigger autoscaling to help increase the throughput of the system."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Autoscaling is an automated process that doesn't require manual intervention. You define autoscale rules, which monitor resource usage. When these rules determine that utilization exceeds a certain threshold, autoscaling increases available resources by scaling out. When utilization falls, autoscaling can remove these resources."
    - content: "Autoscaling is a scale-out/scale-in solution. The system can scale out when specified resource metrics indicate increasing usage and scale in when these metrics drop."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct."
    - content: "Autoscaling is an ideal solution for handling sudden bursts of activity that last for a few minutes."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Autoscaling takes time to add resources. A brief burst of activity might have passed before an autoscaling system can spin up more resources."
    - content: "Scaling up and scaling down provides better availability than autoscaling."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Autoscaling increases availability by adding more instances of web services. If one instance fails, the others should still be available. In a scale-up/scale-down solution, the failure of a single instance could stop the entire service."
  - content: "Autoscaling enables a system to predict the resources required to handle an increasing workload."
    choices:
    - content: "True"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Autoscaling is a reactive technology, not a predictive one. Autoscaling only makes decisions on whether sufficient resources are available to meet the current workload, based on metrics and schedules."
    - content: "False"
      isCorrect: True
      explanation: "Correct."
  - content: "Which of the following scenarios is a suitable candidate for autoscaling?"
    choices:
    - content: "The number of users requiring access to an application varies according to a regular schedule. For example, more users use the system on Fridays than on other days of the week."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct."
    - content: "The system experiences a sudden influx of requests that grinds your system to a halt. The workload has increased exponentially and there appears to be no reason for this surge of activity."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The sudden burst of activity could be caused by a denial-of-service attack that is attempting to overwhelm your system. Autoscaling wouldn't work quickly enough to solve the problem. Instead, use your security infrastructure to filter out these false requests before they reach the servers hosting your system."
    - content: "Over time, your service is becoming more popular, and you need to handle the increasing traffic."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. In this scenario, manual scaling is likely to be a better option because the increased demand is long-lived and can be predicted."
    - content: "Your organization is running a promotion and expects increased traffic to their website for the next couple of weeks. You want to ensure sufficient resources are available to handle the demand expected when the promotion starts."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. You can scale up the system manually before the promotion starts, monitor the activity, and then scale back when the promotion finishes."
