  questions:
  - content: "You defined an autoscale condition with four autoscale rules. The first rule scales out when the CPU utilization reaches 70 percent. The second rule scales back in when the CPU utilization drops below 50 percent. The third rule scales out if memory occupancy exceeds 75 percent. The fourth rule scales back in when memory occupancy falls below 50 percent. When does the system scale out?"
    choices:
    - content: "The system scales out either when CPU utilization reaches 70 percent **or** when memory occupancy exceeds 75 percent."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct."
    - content: "The system scales out when CPU utilization reaches 70 percent **and** memory occupancy exceeds 75 percent."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The system scales out when **either** rule is satisfied."
    - content: "You can't do this with a single autoscale condition. An autoscale condition can only contain autoscale rules that use the same metric."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The rules in an autoscale condition can reference different metrics."
  - content: "An autoscale rule defines a scale-out action that increases the instance count when the disk queue length exceeds 10. The system scaled out two minutes ago, but the disk queue length is still over 10. When will the system scale out again?"
    choices:
    - content: "The autoscale rule triggers another autoscale action immediately and continues doing so until the disk queue length drops below 10, or the maximum number of instances is created."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The autoscale rule doesn't trigger the action again until the *cool-down* period for the rule expires. If the disk queue length is still over 10 at that time, the action is performed."
    - content: "The autoscale rule doesn't run again until the system scales back in."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The autoscale rule can run again without scaling in first, but only after the *cool-down* period for the rule expires."
    - content: "The autoscale rule doesn't trigger the action again until the *cool-down* period for the rule expires. If the disk queue length is still over 10 at that time, the action is performed."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct."
