quiz:
  questions:
  - content: "What is a good first step to analyzing logs in Azure Monitor Logs?"
    choices:
    - content: "Write a KQL query to retrieve all relevant data."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "You need to identify which data is relevant to your analysis before using KQL to extract the data."
    - content: "Carefully look through all of the log data in your Log Analytics workspace."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Raw log data contains an overwhelming amount of information that's often hard to understand in a meaningful way. Looking for specific data based on analysis goals is a more effective first step."
    - content: "Define your analysis goals and assess which tables in your Log Analytics workspace hold data that's relevant to your analysis"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Raw log data contains an overwhelming amount of information that's often hard to understand in a meaningful way. Looking for which table holds specific data based on analysis goals is an effective first step to analyzing logs in Azure Monitor Logs."
  - content: "What can you do to familiarize yourself with the raw log data you've collected in a table?"
    choices:
    - content: "Run simple queries, like `take 10` and `distinct <column name>`, on a specific table or use the Log Analytics user interface to search through, filter and explore the data. "
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Simple queries, like `take 10` and `distinct <column name>`, allow you to hone in on smaller amounts of data and filter away repeating values, which can be useful in assessing raw data."
    - content: "Use the `make_set()` aggregate function to group together all of the data in the table so you can see it all in one place."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Grouping together all of the data in the table makes it difficult to assess the data."
    - content: "Export the data to Excel or an external tool."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Log Analytics provides an intuitive user interface that lets search through, filter and explore the data."
  - content: "How can you enrich your query results with additional data that's not available in the table you've queried in Log Analytics?"
    choices:
    - content: "Use the KQL `join` operator to retrieve information from a different table."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "The KQL `join` operator lets you correlate data from two tables that have a column in common."
    - content: "Use the KQL `import` operator to import the data from a different location."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The KQL `join` operator lets you correlate data from two tables that have a column in common."
    - content: "Add a column to the query results and populate the missing data manually."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "You cannot add data manually from the Log Analytics user interface."
