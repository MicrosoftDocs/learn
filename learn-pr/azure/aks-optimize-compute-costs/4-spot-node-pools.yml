  title: Configure multiple node pools by using AKS spot node pools with the cluster autoscaler
  description: Use spot VMs for user nodes with your AKS cluster to take advantage of unused capacity in Azure and to optimize costs. Here you'll explore how to configure a spot node pool and enable the autoscaler on the node pool. You'll also see how to deploy a workload that uses the node pool's taint information to schedule the workload on the node pool's nodes.

  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:

  - content: "Suppose you have a stateless service that processes online orders and runs on an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster. You decide to use spot node pools on the AKS cluster to optimize compute costs on the cluster. How do you add spot node pools to an AKS cluster?"
    choices:
    - content: "Run the `az aks update` command and specify the `convert-to-spot-vm` parameter."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "It isn't possible to convert an existing user node pool to a spot node pool."
    - content: "Use the Azure portal to add a new spot node pool to the AKS cluster."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The Azure portal currently doesn't support the option to add spot node pools. "
    - content: "Run the `az aks nodepool add` command to add a new spot user node pool to the AKS cluster."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Spot node pools must be added to an AKS cluster. They can't be updated, and availability can't be guaranteed, because Azure will allocate VMs to the underlying scale set only if capacity is available."

  - content: "For the service described in the preceding question, which eviction policy is the most cost-effective option for configuring the spot node pool?"
    choices:
    - content: "Use the `az aks update` command to set the `--eviction-policy` to `Hibernate`."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "There's no `Hibernate` eviction policy available for spot nodes."
    - content: "Use the `az aks update` command to set the `--eviction-policy` to `Delete`."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "The `Delete` eviction policy enables you to avoid both paying disk costs and hitting quota limits. This option is the most cost effective one to use with spot node pools."
    - content: "Use the `az aks update` command and set the `--eviction-policy` to `Deallocate`."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "A deallocated VM keeps counting toward your spot virtual CPU quota, and charges for the underlying, allocated disks still apply. This option isn't the most cost-effective one to use with spot node pools."

  - content: "For the service described in the preceding questions, how do you ensure that workloads are scheduled on the nodes of the spot user node pool?"
    choices:
    - content: "AKS ensures that new workloads are always scheduled on spot node pools in an AKS cluster. This behavior is the default, and no additional configuration is required."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "You configure the workload manifest file with a toleration, which tells the system to schedule the workload on the nodes in the spot node pool."
    - content: "Configure the workload manifest file with a `nodeTaint` value of `kubernetes.azure.com/scalesetpriority=spot:NoSchedule`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The `nodeTaint` value of `kubernetes.azure.com/scalesetpriority=spot:NoSchedule` is automatically applied to the spot node pool. You configure the workload manifest file with a toleration, which tells the system to schedule the workload on the nodes in the spot node pool."
    - content: "Configure the workload manifest file with a toleration that applies the `NoSchedule` effect. Both the affinity and toleration use the key `kubernetes.azure.com/scalesetpriority`. This configuration tells the system to schedule the workload on the nodes in the spot node pool."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "You configure the workload manifest file with a toleration and node affinity as described."
