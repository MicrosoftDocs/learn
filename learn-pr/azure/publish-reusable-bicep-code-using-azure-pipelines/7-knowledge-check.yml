quiz:
  questions:
  - content: What should you do to resolve the error?
    choices:
    - content: Use semantic versioning.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. The problem is unrelated to the module versioning strategy.
    - content: Publish the module manually at the command line, not in an automated pipeline.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. You can publish the module from a pipeline, as long as the pipeline's service principal is authorized to write to the container registry.
    - content: Grant the service principal permission to write to your container registry.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. The error message indicates an authorization error, so you need to authorize the service principal to write to the container registry.
  - content: You need to test the resources defined in a Bicep module. You choose to deploy the resources to your Azure subscription. Which Azure CLI command should you use?
    choices:
    - content: |
        `az ts publish`
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. You don't need to publish a template spec.
    - content: |
        `az bicep publish`
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. You need to deploy the resources defined in the module, not publish the module itself.
    - content: |
        `az deployment group create`
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. You should deploy the resources by using the `az deployment group create` command.
  - content: Suppose your team uses a multipart versioning system. Which of the following changes to a Bicep file should result in a change to the *major* version number?
    choices:
    - content: You add a new variable.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. Adding a new variable isn't a breaking change, so you don't need to update the major version.
    - content: You add a new mandatory parameter.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. Adding a new parameter is a breaking change, because anybody who uses the Bicep file must update their deployments to provide a value for the parameter.
    - content: You add a new output.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. Adding a new output isn't a breaking change, so you don't need to update the major version.
