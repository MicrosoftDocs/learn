  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: 'Which of these features does Azure Machine Learning studio designer have?'
    choices:
    - content: "Network Security controls and overview"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Network security can be managed through the Azure portal and Workspace."
    - content: "Visual canvas with drag and drop controls."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Azure Machine Learning Designer is found within the Azure Machine Learning Studio. It's suited for building ML pipelines by dragging and dropping modules to create workflows or tasks execute in a particular order."
    - content: "Model storage and versioning"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Model storage and versioning can be accessed via the Workspace and Notebook feature."
  - content: 'Which of the following descriptions accurately describes a Pipeline?'
    choices:
    - content: "A coding environment for deploying and monitoring models"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The coding environment can be found within a typical deployment pipeline but isn't a description of a pipeline."
    - content: "A top-level resource for managing all assets you create when you use Azure Machine Learning"
      isCorrect: false
