  - content: "Suppose the operations to update inventory and process payments are in the same transaction. A user is attempting to apply store credit for the full amount, and submitted the exact same order via phone and laptop at the same time. The database behind the scenes is an ACID-compliant database, what would happen?" 
    choices:
    - content: "Both orders would be processed and use the in-store credit."
