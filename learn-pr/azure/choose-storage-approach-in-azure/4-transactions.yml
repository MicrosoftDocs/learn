  questions:
  - content: "Which type of transactional database system would work best for product data?"
    choices:
    - content: "OLAP"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. OLAP systems support fewer users, have longer response times, can be less available, and typically handle *large or complex* transactions."
    - content: "OLTP"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. OLTP systems support a large set of users, have quick response times, handle large volumes of data, are highly available, and are great for small or relatively simple transactions. An OLTP system would work best for transactional data like product data that's closely linked to inventory."

  - content: "Suppose a retailer's operations to update inventory and process payments are in the same transaction. A user is trying to apply a $30 store credit on an order from their laptop and is submitting the exact same order by using the store credit (for the full amount) from their phone. Two identical orders are received. The database behind the scenes is an ACID-compliant database. What will happen?" 
    choices:
    - content: "Both orders will be processed and use the in-store credit."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. In this scenario, the second order will be processed differently from the first order."
    - content: "One order will be processed and use the in-store credit. The other order will update the remaining inventory for the items in the basket, but it won't complete the order."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. In this scenario, the second order will be processed differently from the first order, and that affects what happens to the inventory."
    - content: "One order will be processed and use the in-store credit, and the other order won't be processed."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. When the second order determines that the in-store credit has already been used, it will roll back the transaction."
