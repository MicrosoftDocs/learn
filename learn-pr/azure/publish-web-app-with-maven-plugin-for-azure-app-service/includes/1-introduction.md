You're a Java developer working for a company that creates web apps that currently run on servers that are located on premises. Your company has decided to migrate its web apps to Azure App Service, and you want to make the migration as smooth as possible for your development team. A smooth migration allows them to continue to create and deploy web apps with the tools they already use. For example, your development team uses Apache Maven to automate its build process for Java applications. 

Azure App Service has several plugins to support different languages and technologies. The Maven Plugin for Azure App Service lets your Java developers continue using the build tool they're familiar with. The Maven plugin supports configuring and deploying apps to Azure App Service, and you want to research how to integrate this plugin into your existing build automation.

In this module, you'll create a Java web app using a Maven web app archetype. When you've finished creating your web app, you'll configure it to run locally and test it. Once you've verified that your web app is working locally, you'll deploy to Azure App Service by using the Maven plugin.

By the end of this module, you'll learn how easy it is to incorporate the Maven Plugin for Azure App Service in your existing build automation. Incorporating the plugin will allow your development team to continue using the Maven toolset your company is familiar with.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you'll:

- Develop a Java web app.
- Configure the Maven Plugin for Azure App Service.
- Deploy the web app using the Maven Plugin.

## Prerequisites

- Experience writing web apps in Java
- Knowledge of building and deploying Java web apps with Maven
