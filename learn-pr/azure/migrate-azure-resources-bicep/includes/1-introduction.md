Your team might have already deployed Azure resources by using the Azure portal, JSON Azure Resource Manager templates (ARM templates), or a command-line interface (CLI). If you're used to working with JSON ARM templates, you know how Bicep provides a better template authoring process than JSON ARM templates. It's worth the investment to use Bicep for your Azure resources, but migrating your existing deployments to Bicep isn't accomplished with a click of a button. The process involves a recommended workflow that includes converting, migrating, refactoring, and testing.

## Example scenario

Suppose you're responsible for deploying and configuring the Azure infrastructure at a toy company. Recently, your company acquired a smaller competitor that has created a popular toy truck. This company also uses Azure to host its application infrastructure, but the company deploys its resources by using the Azure portal. It deployed a virtual machine that provides some of the services that support the toy truck.

You want to begin the process of standardizing on the use of Bicep for all resource deployments. To accomplish this task, you'll convert and migrate your resources to Bicep. You'll refactor the templates for clarity and test deployments to verify the migration.

## What will we do?

In this module, you'll learn about the recommended workflow for migrating your Azure resources to Bicep. This workflow consists of five phases: convert, migrate, refactor, test, and deploy.

You'll learn how to convert and migrate your Azure resources and JSON templates to Bicep files. You'll also learn about tools and resources that can help improve the quality of your templates. Finally, you'll learn how to do test deployments of your converted templates.

## What's the main goal?

After completing this module, you'll understand how to migrate your Azure resources to Bicep. You'll also gain confidence in the fidelity of the templates you'll use in future deployments.
