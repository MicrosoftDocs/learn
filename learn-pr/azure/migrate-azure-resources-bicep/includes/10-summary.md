Your company recently acquired a smaller competitor that has created a toy truck. This company uses Azure to host its application infrastructure, but it deploys its resources by using the Azure portal and JSON ARM templates. Your company uses Bicep for infrastructure as code, and you needed to migrate all Azure resources to use Bicep for deployments.

In this module, you learned about the process and recommended workflow for migrating your Azure resources to Bicep. The workflow consists of five phases: convert, migrate, refactor, test, and deploy. You learned about the limitations of this workflow and how to align your templates with your team's code standards and best practices. You also learned about tools and resources that can help you complete the workflow.

You exported the toy truck's back-end virtual machine to a JSON ARM template. You used the Bicep `decompile` command to convert the JSON template to a Bicep file. After the conversion, you moved the resources to a deployable Bicep file. You refactored the Bicep file to adjust the symbolic names, parameters, and variables. You added parameter descriptions. You tested the refactored template by using the what-if operation, made adjustments, and tested again. Finally, you deployed your template to your Azure environment.

After you successfully deploy your production environment by using your Bicep code, you're done! The next steps are to implement a pipeline and automated deployments.
