  questions:
  - content: "You need to convert an existing JSON template to Bicep by using built-in tooling. What command do you run from the terminal?"
    choices:
    - content: "`bicep build 'path/to/file.json'`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "`bicep build` is the command you use to convert a Bicep template to a JSON template."
    - content: "`az bicep decompile 'path/to/file.json'`"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "You can use either `bicep decompile` or `az bicep decompile` to convert your JSON templates to Bicep templates."
    - content: "`bicep convert 'path/to/file.json'`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The `convert` command is not recognized in the Bicep tooling."
  - content: "You need to export a deployed Azure resource to an ARM template. What steps do you take to complete this task?"
    choices:
    - content: "In the Azure portal, go to the resource you want to export, select **Export template**, and then select **Download** to save a copy of the template."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "You can export resources from the Azure portal by completing these steps."
    - content: "In the Azure portal, go to the resource group you want to export, select **Export template**, and then select **Download** to save a copy of the template."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The **Export template** option under a resource group exports the entire resource group, not a single resource."
    - content: "In the Azure portal, select **Create a resource**, enter **template** in the search box, and then select **Template deployment** from Azure Marketplace."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "You use a template deployment in Azure Marketplace to create and deploy an existing template into Azure, not to create a template."
  - content: "What is a true statement about exporting templates in the Azure portal?"
    choices:
    - content: "You can use the export template function to create a complete export of any Azure resource, and you can use it to redeploy resources."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Some Azure resources you can't completely export by using the Azure portal."
    - content: "You can use the export template function to export the entire contents of your Azure subscription."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "In Azure, you can't export the entire contents of your subscription by using a single command."
    - content: "The export template function doesn't always perform a complete export of an Azure resource. It should be used as a reference point when you build your templates."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Use the export template function as a reference point to help you build your templates."
  - content: "What is a true statement about the ARM template what-if operation?"
    choices:
    - content: "The ARM template what-if operation deploys a template to your Azure environment in a temporary state."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The ARM template what-if operation shows you how resources will change if you deploy a template."
    - content: "The ARM template what-if operation provides information about how resources will change if you deploy a template."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "The ARM template what-if operation shows you how resources will change if you deploy a template."
    - content: "You access the ARM template what-if operation in the Azure portal, and you use it to deploy templates to management groups."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "You use the ARM template what-if operation at the command line and not in the Azure portal."
