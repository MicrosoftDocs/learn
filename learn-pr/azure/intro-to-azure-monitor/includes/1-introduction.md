Performance might be one of the many reasons you host your infrastructure or applications on Azure. The deployment of resources shouldn't be the end of your interaction. How do you know if you're gaining benefits with Azure hosting? How can you prove your return on investment? Are there aspects to your applications that are not giving the performance you or your users expect?

Monitoring your Azure resources provides insights into many aspects of performance, security, and health.

## Example scenario

Consider a web application that you're hosting on Azure. You decided to move the application from your on-premises infrastructure due to performance issues. During back-to-school campaigns, your web site is being overloaded and response times are causing users to leave. You don't want to spend more money on new server hardware just to support these limited engagements where load peaks.

Azure offers the ability to scale up or scale out your applications when needed. Azure can then automatically scale them back when resource needs drop off. Initially, you may not know where the capacity issues are. Using the Azure Monitor capabilities, you can determine where your application-scaling needs are and adjust those parameters in your scaling strategy. You can base these decisions on concrete metrics and log data.
