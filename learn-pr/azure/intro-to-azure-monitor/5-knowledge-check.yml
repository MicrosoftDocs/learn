### General guidance (https://review.learn.microsoft.com/learn-docs/docs/id-guidance-knowledge-check)
###  - Questions are complete sentences ending with a question mark
###  - No true/false questions
###  - 3 answers per question
###  - All answers about the same length
###  - Numeric answers listed in sorted order
###  - No "All of the above" and/or "None of the above" as answer choices
###  - No "Not" or "Except" in questions
###  - No second person ("you") in the questions or answers
###  - Provide a meaningful explanation for both correct and incorrect answers
###
### Question content requirements:
###  - Write 5 questions
###  - Questions 1,2 must test this Learning Objective: "Describe how <attributes> of <product> work to <solve problem>"
###      Guidance: These two questions can be short, no need for a long scenario to analyze. Test if they understand how the product works.
###      Example: "What differentiates an action from a control action in an Azure Logic App?"
###  - Questions 3,4,5 must test this Learning Objective: "Evaluate whether <product> is appropriate to <general product use case>"
###      Guidance: Use scenario questions that ask the learner to analyze a situation with the "when to use" criteria presented in the module.
###      Example: "Suppose you work for a financial company. You're building a system to let your brokers trade financial instruments. Your system must monitor market conditions, detect changes, and execute trades. You'll need to handle a large volume of transactions and you'll need to do it quickly. The faster you can complete trades, the more of an advantage you'll have over your competitors. Which requirement of this system would be difficult for Logic Apps to satisfy?"

quiz:
  questions:
  - content: "What action do you need to take for Azure Monitor to start recording metrics on your resources?"
    choices:
    - content: "None. Azure Monitor begins recording as soon as you create resources."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Azure Monitor begins collecting metrics on all Azure resources as soon as they're created."
    - content: "You must configure at least one rule."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. You don't need to configure any alerts or rules for Azure Monitor to begin collecting metrics data."
    - content: "You must associate the resources with a Log Analytics workspace."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. You only need Log Analytics workspace association for Azure Monitor Logs, not for basic metrics recording."
  - content: "What are Azure Monitor Insights?"
    choices:
    - content: "Quantitative measurements of application or resource performance."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Azure Monitor Metrics are quantitative measurements that show snapshots of application or resource performance."
    - content: "Curated visualizations that provide a customized monitoring experience."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Azure Monitor Insights are large, scalable, curated visualizations that require minimal configuration."
    - content: "Textual records of events that occur in a resource or application."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Logs are textual records of events, actions, and messages that occur in a resource or application."
  - content: "What's a good way to combine metrics data into a single view for reporting?"
    choices:
    - content: "Azure Event Hubs."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. You can use Event Hubs to stream monitoring data to external tools, but it isn't an optimal tool for combining metrics into a single view."
    - content: "Log Analytics workspace."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A Log Analytics workspace is required for the Azure Monitor logging and lets you query data, but isn't an optimal tool for combining metrics into a single view."
    - content: "Azure Dashboards."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Dashboards can combine different kinds of data into a single pane in the Azure portal."
