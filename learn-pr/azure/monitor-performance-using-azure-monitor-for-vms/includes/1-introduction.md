Imagine you're newly hired into an IT department for a large financial services firm. From an operational perspective, the IT department has been building more workloads and applications in Azure. Monitoring these workloads and applications has become difficult over time. The management team won't approve moving the on-premises monitoring environment to Azure because of licensing costs. As part of the operations team, you'll be exploring cloud native tooling for monitoring and logging by examining Azure Monitor Logs, Log Analytics workspaces, and Azure Monitor for VMs.
