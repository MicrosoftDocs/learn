The goal here was to help you evaluate whether Kubernetes would be a good choice as a container-orchestration platform for your business. You looked at several features that enhance the Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) offering. You learned how these features can help you decide if Kubernetes is a good fit for new projects, or if you should move to Kubernetes to orchestrate current container deployments.

You saw how Kubernetes provides for:

- Deployment of containers.
- Self-healing of containers.
- Dynamically scaling container count up or down.
- Automated rolling updates and rollbacks of containers.
- Management of storage.
- Management of network traffic.
- Storage and management of sensitive information such as usernames and passwords.

To deploy and manage your drone-tracking solution into new customer regions, you were looking for a container-orchestration platform. You now understand how Kubernetes can help you develop, deploy, and manage apps in your container environment.
