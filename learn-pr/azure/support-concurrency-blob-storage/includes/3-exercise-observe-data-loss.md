Your news organization has a web app the financial reporters use to submit stories to their newsroom chief. The app uses Azure Blob storage to store stories for the chief  to review submitted stories.

The newsroom chief first uses the editing application to create notes for the new stories they want to be written. When they're finished, they save their changes. Saving them uploads the notes to a new blob. Stories are then assigned to a reporter. A reporter assigned to a story loads the notes, overwrites, and expands on them with their story, and finally saves them.

Now imagine two reporters are assigned to the same story. Reporter A begins work quickly, retrieving the notes and beginning to write a long story. Reporter B begins soon after, but works faster and finishes their story first. Reporter B saves their changes, committing them to the blob. Later, Reporter A finishes their story and saves it.

The newsroom chief has been receiving complaints from their reporters that stories are being lost. On executing the app, you'll notice Reporter A is unaware of the previous completed work of Reporter B, and Reporter A has their story read by the newsroom chief.

In this exercise, you'll deploy the app and observe the last writer wins issues created by concurrent updates.

## Create an Azure storage account and store the connection string

To experiment with Blob storage concurrency code, we'll start by creating a Blob storage account using the Cloud Shell.

1. Run the commands below to create a new storage account:

    ```azurecli
    storage=mediastorage$RANDOM
    az storage account create --name $storage --kind StorageV2 -g <rgn>[sandbox resource group name]</rgn> --allow-blob-public-access false
    ```

1. Next enter `az storage account show-connection-string` to get the connection string and store it into an environment variable named `STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING`. 

    ```azurecli
    export STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING=$(az storage account show-connection-string --name $storage --query connectionString -o tsv)
    ```

## Download and review the sample code

[!include[](../../../includes/azure-cloudshell-copy-paste-tip.md)]

1. In the Cloud Shell, clone your app from GitHub.

    ```console
    git clone https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/mslearn-support-concurrency-blob-storage.git
    cd mslearn-support-concurrency-blob-storage/src/NewsEditor
    ```

    The above commands move you into the NewsEditor app folder. There other folders that have completed code for units in the rest of the module.

1. Open the **Program.cs** file in the code editor.

    ```console
    code Program.cs
    ```

1. Scroll down to the `SimulateReporter` method. This method simulates the activities of a reporter working in a version of the news editing application that does not perform any kind of active concurrency management.

    ```csharp
    private static async Task SimulateReporter(string authorName, TimeSpan writingTime)
    {
        // First, the reporter retrieves the current contents
        Console.WriteLine($"{authorName} begins work");
        var blob = CloudStorageAccount.Parse(connectionString)
            .CreateCloudBlobClient()
            .GetContainerReference(containerName)
            .GetBlockBlobReference(blobName);

        var contents = await blob.DownloadTextAsync();
        Console.WriteLine($"{authorName} loads the file and sees the following content: \"{contents}\"");

        // Next, the author writes their story. This takes some time.
        var currentETag = blob.Properties.Etag;
        Console.WriteLine($"\"{contents}\" has this ETag: {blob.Properties.ETag}");
        Console.WriteLine($"{authorName} begins writing their story...");
        await Task.Delay(writingTime);
        Console.WriteLine($"{authorName} has finished writing their story");

        // Finally, they save their story back to the blob.
        var story = $"[[{authorName.ToUpperInvariant()}'S STORY]]";
        await blob.UploadTextAsync(story);
        Console.WriteLine($"{authorName} has saved their story to Blob storage. New blob contents: \"{story}\"");
    }
    ```

    In the simulation, two instances of this method will run simultaneously with different timings. Both reporters will observe the same contents when they first load the file from blob storage. The reporter that takes longer to write their story and save it back to the blob will overwrite the content placed there by the first author without knowing it.

1. Close the Code editor (CTRL+Q).

## Execute the test app

1. In the Cloud Shell, build and run the app with this command.

    ```console
    dotnet run
    ```

1. The output is:

    ```console
    The newsroom chief has saved story notes to the blob mslearn-blob-concurrency-demo/newsStory.txt

    Reporter A begins work
    Reporter A loads the file and sees the following content: "[[CHIEF'S STORY NOTES]]"
    Reporter A begins writing their story...
    Reporter B begins work
    Reporter B loads the file and sees the following content: "[[CHIEF'S STORY NOTES]]"
    Reporter B begins writing their story...
    Reporter B has finished writing their story
    Reporter B has saved their story to Blob storage. New blob contents: "[[REPORTER B'S STORY]]"
    Reporter A has finished writing their story
    Reporter A has saved their story to Blob storage. New blob contents: "[[REPORTER A'S STORY]]"

    =============================================

    Reporters have finished, here's the story saved to the blob:
    [[REPORTER A'S STORY]]
    ```

    These console messages allow you to follow the flow of the app; in this example Reporter B has lost their work.
