In optimistic concurrency, the application checks whether a blob has changed since the last time it was read. Azure Blob storage generates an identifier for every object when it changes state. Optimistic concurrency makes use of this identifier to determine if another user has changed the content since it was last read. If the object has been changed since it was last read, the commit doesn't complete.

To implement an optimistic approach to accessing a blob, the environment (or service) needs to give a value for a file's current state. One example could be to use the last modified date, or you could use a combination of file name, size, and modified date. You need to have confidence that no changes were made to the file since you last accessed it.

In the example, both reporters were trying to write to the same blob, but neither checked if the file changed before they tried to update it. If the app checked for updates, it would've detected that the file was changed by something else. Reporter A's app doesn't allow the changes to be saved to the Blob storage, as it would overwrite Reporter B's work. The app can then add logic to handle these conflicts.

### Azure Blob Storage

Azure provides a unique identifier that's updated whenever a change occurs on a blob. This identifier known as an entity tag (ETag), and its value can be read at any time and stored. An app can store the ETag, complete the processing it needs to, and try saving the changes. The stored value it has for the ETag is passed at the saving point.

Azure Blob storage service can now do an atomic action of checking its current value of the ETag against the stored version sent by the app. If they match, it can perform the update. If they don't match, the update fails and the app that made the request is notified using the HTTP protocol. The failed update is returned as a 412 error (precondition has failed). In this case, the precondition is that the ETags must match before an update is processed.

All the methods that can update a blob in a storage account support this approach. The first step is to get the current value for the ETag:

```csharp
Response<BlobDownloadResult> response = await blobClient.DownloadContentAsync();
BlobDownloadResult downloadResult = response.Value;
var currentETag = downloadResult.Details.ETag;
```

The app needs to store the value of the current ETag in a variable so it can send it with the `UploadAsync` call.

```csharp
// Set the If-Match condition to the current ETag
BlobUploadOptions blobUploadOptions = new()
{
    Conditions = new BlobRequestConditions()
    {
        IfMatch = currentETag
    }
};
await blobClient.UploadAsync(BinaryData.FromString(story), blobUploadOptions);
```

Now that the processing is complete, the app can try to save those changes with the preceding code. This code uploads some text (`story`) to a file (represented by `blobClient`). When accessing the current file on the server, make sure it has the same ETag (`currentETag`).

An app can always check before updating a blob that no other process or app has changed it on the meantime.

## Advantages and disadvantages

Optimistic concurrency is a good choice in environments when there's a low contention for data. Optimistic concurrency works well because data isn't locked. This approach doesn't block connections from trying to update data at the same time. The process starts with an attempt to write data. It's called optimistic because you hope that no one else has changed the file since you read it.

Optimistic concurrency doesn't put a lock on data, but instead checks to see if data has changed at the point of trying to update it. Also, optimistic concurrency assumes there isn't any interference among multiple users. Because of this, optimistic concurrency is more appropriate in environments where there's low contention.

A disadvantage is that every app must implement the optimistic checks on the ETag. Apps that don't implement a check are free to make updates and data can still be lost. Optimistic concurrency isn't enforced, it requires all apps that use the blob to adopt it.
