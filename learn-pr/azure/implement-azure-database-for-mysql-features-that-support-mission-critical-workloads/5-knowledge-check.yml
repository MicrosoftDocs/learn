quiz:
  questions:
  - content: "Your application serves mission-critical traffic around the clock every day. Your traffic is generally low with occasional heavy bursts. Which option is most appropriate?"
    choices:
    - content: "Burstable Tier with the Autoscale IOPS feature enabled."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The Burstable tier isn't ideal for mission-critical traffic, and it doesn't support high availability."
    - content: "Business Critical Tier with high availability."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "This is the best solution for mission-critical traffic, able to withstand failures in the primary database node."
    - content: "General Purpose Tier with a read replica. "
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "A read replica doesn't provide resilience to the primary database node going down."
  - content: "You encrypt your database at rest using a custom key. One day, the production key is mistakenly deleted. Which option protects against this?"
    choices:
    - content: "Soft deletion."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct, unless/until the key is purged, soft-deleted keys can be recovered."
    - content: "High availability."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "High availability protects the database nodes, and the key encrypts both HA instances."
    - content: "The Business Critical tier."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The Business Critical tier isn't related to key management."
  - content: "You want to detect anomalous sign in attempts. Which option is best?"
    choices:
    - content: "Write a cron job to monitor MySQL logs."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "While this would work, it introduces manual, error-prone work requiring ongoing maintenance."
    - content: "Enable Microsoft Defender for Cloud."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Defender for Cloud is a simple solution to detect anomalous sign in attempts and other security issues."
    - content: "Configure a VPN with Private Access."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "A VPN controls network connectivity, not sign in attempts made over that network."
  - content: "Your production traffic is generally low with occasional heavy bursts. You over-provisioned IOPS capacity to ensure a solid user experience, but you’ve noticed that usage hasn’t surpassed 50%. While you'll be launching new products next month, you also want to save costs without affecting the experience. Which option should you consider?"
    choices:
    - content: "Adjusting the pre-provisioned IOPS to 55% of the current value."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This is less cost-effective as it over-provisions IOPS capacity. It also assumes the traffic will only impact IOPS by 5%."
    - content: "Enabling the Autoscale IOPS feature."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "This is an easy and cost-effective way to handle traffic bursts and changes."
    - content: "Switch to the Burstable tier to handle the bursts."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The Burstable tier isn't ideal for production workloads, offers fewer maximum IOPS than the other tiers, and besides bursts CPU: not IOPS."
  - content: "Your application delivers hourly reports that place a heavy load on the database and at peak traffic, causing the user experience to degrade. How can you process reporting queries and manage the application load at the same time?"
    choices:
    - content: "Increase compute size."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "While this would help serve more queries, the increased capacity can become quickly insufficient as application and reporting load increase."
    - content: "Provision a read replica."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "This use case is perfect for read replicas, to take load off the primary database."
    - content: "Add additional IOPS."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "While IOPS do help scale, they don't help with CPU and RAM usage from queries."
