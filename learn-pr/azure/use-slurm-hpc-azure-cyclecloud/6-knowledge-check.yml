  title: Knowledge Check
  questions:
    - content: "Which command can you use to display information on jobs, partitions, and nodes that Slurm manages?"
      choices:
        - content: "`sstat`"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. This command lets you view information about resources utilized by running jobs or job steps."
        - content: "`sview`"
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct. The `sview` command allows you to view state information on jobs, partitions, and nodes that Slurm manages."
        - content: "`sinfo`"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. This command displays information on partitions and nodes that Slurm manages."
        - content: "`sbatch`"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. Use this command to submit a job script for later execution. These scripts generally include one or more srun commands to initiate parallel tasks.
    - content: "You have a job that has a large number of complex sequential steps, with each new step depending on calculations performed in the previous step. Which type of Azure CycleCloud partition is appropriate for this job?"
      choices:
        - content: "HTC partition"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. HTC partitions are appropriate for workloads that are largely independent of one another and where similar tasks can be delegated across different cluster nodes."
        - content: "HPC partition"
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct. HPC partitions are appropriate for workloads that have dependencies on prior steps and where the job executes more quickly when greater resources are allocated to the job."
    - content: "Which of the following tools do you run after changing the Slurm configuration to apply the changes to the Azure CycleCloud cluster?"
      choices:
        - content: "`sinfo`"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. This command displays information on partitions and nodes managed by Slurm."
        - content: "`cyclecloud_slurm.sh`"
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct. You use the `cyclecloud_slurm.sh` script to apply changes after you have modified the Slurm configuration."
        - content: "`srun`"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. You use this tool to run a job task."
        - content: "`sbatch`"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. You use this command to submit a job script for later execution. These scripts generally include one or more `srun` commands to initiate parallel tasks."
