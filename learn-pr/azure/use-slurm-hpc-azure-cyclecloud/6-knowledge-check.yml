  title: Knowledge Check
  questions:
    - content: "Which command can you use to display information on jobs, partitions, and nodes managed by Slurm?"
      choices:
        - content: "sstat"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. View information about resources utilized by running jobs or job steps.
        - content: "sview"
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: Correct. Sview allows you to view state information on jobs, partitions, and nodes managed by Slurm.
        - content: "sinfo"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. Displays information on partitions and nodes managed by Slurm.
        - content: "sbatch"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. Use this command to submit a job script for later execution. These scripts generally include one or more srun commands to initiate parallel tasks.
    - content: "You have a job that has a large number of complex sequential steps with each new step depending on calculations performed in the previous step. Which type of Azure CycleCloud partition would be appropriate for this job?"
      choices:
        - content: "HTC partition"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. HTC partitions are appropriate for workloads that are largely independent of one another and where similar tasks can be delegated across different cluster nodes.
        - content: "HPC partition"
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: Correct. HPC partitions are appropriate for workloads that have dependencies on prior steps and where the job executes more quickly when greater resources are allocated to the job.
    - content: "Which of the following tools do you run after changing the Slurm configuration to apply the changes to the Azure CycleCloud cluster?"
      choices:
        - content: "sinfo"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. Displays information on partitions and nodes managed by Slurm.
        - content: "cyclecloud_slurm.sh"
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: Correct. You use the cyclecloud_slurm.sh script to apply changes after you have modified the Slurm configuration.
        - content: "srun"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. Use this tool to run a job task.
        - content: "sbatch"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. Use this command to submit a job script for later execution. These scripts generally include one or more srun commands to initiate parallel tasks.
