All applications need to store secrets: they could be a database password,
an access token to a protected resource, or a private key used to access
encrypted data. Those keys are one the most critical assets of your company,
and hackers will try to access them: what are the best practices to manage
them, and how can you apply those practices to a real-life Java application?

This module will introduce the concepts of Zero Trust and Zero Secrets,
where your Java application won't manage those secrets at all. It will make
the task of attackers much more difficult.

Using Azure Key Vault, you'll learn how to apply those principles to a
Java application that we'll correctly secure throughout this module.

## Goals

By the end of this module, you'll:

- Understand best practices like Zero Trust to secure any application running in the cloud.
- Know how to apply those practices using Azure Key Vault on a Java project running on Azure.

## Prerequisites

- Familiarity with developing and running Java applications
- Beginner-level experience with cloud infrastructure
