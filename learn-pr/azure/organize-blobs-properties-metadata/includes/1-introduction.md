Suppose you are the lead developer for Trey Research, a company that manufactures echo-friendly chemicals for industrial applications. Your company maintains a large collection of testing and safety documents in Azure Storage. To help meet your company's audit requirements, you have been asked to create a reporting application that retrieves system-related attributes for each document. Your auditors need to be able to open any document to determine whether it has been included in a report. Your reporting application needs to set a custom metadata field with the last time that the reporting application was run.

In this module, you will learn about using properties and custom metadata to help manage data saved to Azure Storage. You'll compare the various methods you can use to access and modify this metadata.

By the end of this module, you will be able to code a basic ASP.NET Core app to retrieve existing properties and to write new metadata.
