  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: 'What is network latency?'
    choices:
    - content: "The amount of data that can fit on the connection."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "_Bandwidth_ refers to the amount of data that can fit on the connection."
    - content: "The distance data must travel to reach its destination."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Although distance can affect latency, latency does not measure distance."
    - content: "The time it takes for data to travel over the network."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Latency measures the time it takes for data to reach its destination. Latency is typically measured in milliseconds."
  - content: 'How does Azure Traffic Manager reduce latency?'
    choices:
    - content: 'It chooses only the fastest networks between endpoints.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Traffic Manager enables you to control the distribution of traffic across your application endpoints."
    - content: "It can route traffic to the closest endpoint."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "You can have Traffic Manager route traffic by geography or by network performance."
    - content: 'It caches content, similar to how content delivery networks work.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Traffic Manager enables you to control the distribution of traffic across your application endpoints."
