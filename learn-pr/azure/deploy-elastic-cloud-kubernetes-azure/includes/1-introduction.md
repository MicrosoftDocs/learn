Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) provides users an enterprise-grade, operationally efficient way of deploying applications on Kubernetes infrastructure. The Elastic Cloud on Kubernetes, which consists of custom resource definitions and a Kubernetes operator, gives you best practices already built into your machine.

## Example scenario

Imagine you work in IT for Tailwind Traders, an online retailer that runs its applications and workloads on Linux containers using Kubernetes. Your website uses a SQL database which customers have complained about being slow. Your boss’ boss wants to improve the search speed. Your boss doesn’t want to have to manage a large amount of infrastructure. So you recommend Elastic Cloud on Kubernetes on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) for the best of both worlds!

## What will we be doing?

Through the course of this module, we'll walk through creating an AKS cluster and installing Elastic Cloud on Kubernetes. Then, we'll deploy Elasticsearch and Kibana. You'll need to set up and use your own pay-as-you-go Azure subscription to participate in the exercises, which may incur a nominal fee. To keep costs low, you can either sign up for a free trial or set the machine to the smallest size and be sure to take it down when the exercise is over.

## What is the main goal? 

By the end of this module, you'll be able to deploy Elastic Cloud on Kubernetes on AKS.
