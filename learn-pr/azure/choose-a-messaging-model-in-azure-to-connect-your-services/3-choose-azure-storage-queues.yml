  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:

  - content: "Suppose you are building an application to automate student record keeping functions at a university. One of the business rules you need to implement is the following: when a student completes a course, the grade must be added to their transcript, their financial aid eligibility must be reviewed, and the student must be notified. All three should happen immediately. Which Azure service would be a good choice to store the messages in this system?"
    choices:

      explanation: "Azure Service Bus Queues do not support multiple subscribers."
    - content: "Azure Service Bus Topics"
