In this module, you explored some of the available technologies for connecting your on-premises network with Azure. You now understand how an Azure virtual network operates. You learned about the capabilities of Azure VPN Gateway and its associated topologies, such as site-to-site and point-to-site connections. Additionally, you know the benefits and features of several hybrid network services and architectures. Including Azure ExpressRoute, VPN, ExpressRoute with VPN, and the hub-spoke topology.

You can apply this knowledge to your organization's migration. By using a Microsoft connectivity provider to set up an ExpressRoute connection, you can help give your organization a fast, secure connection to the cloud. The ExpressRoute circuit can incorporate a VPN failover for extra resilience. Should the ExpressRoute circuit become temporarily unavailable, the VPN link maintains the connection.

By using a hybrid network architecture, such as ExpressRoute, you establish a high-performance user experience that provides a feature-rich, cost-effective, and private networking connection.
