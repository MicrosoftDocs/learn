  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: 'Which of the following is a valid connectivity model for Azure ExpressRoute?'
    choices:
    - content: A cross-network connection
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Cross-network connections and ExpressRoute are supported, but the correct model is via a colocated facility through a Cloud Exchange provider.
    - content: A point-to-point Ethernet network
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: A point-to-point Ethernet connection, connects on-premises datacenters and offices to Azure through a point-to-point Ethernet link.
    - content: Azure network-to-network connectivity
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: VNet-to-VNet connections can be configured in ExpressRoute, but it isn't a connectivity model.
    - content: A point-to-site network
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: A point-to-site network is a connectivity model for a VPN gateway.
  - content: 'What is the maximum available bandwidth for an ExpressRoute circuit?'
    choices:
    - content: 50 Mbps
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Although 50 Mbps is an available bandwidth, it isn't the maximum available.
    - content: 1 Gbps
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Although 1 Gbps is an available bandwidth, it isn't the maximum available.
    - content: 200 Gbps
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: A 200-Gbps bandwidth circuit isn't available with ExpressRoute.
    - content: 100 Gbps
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: A 100-Gbps bandwidth circuit is currently the maximum available with ExpressRoute.
  - content: 'What would you use a VPN gateway for?'
    choices:
    - content: To connect to a CloudExchange provider
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: CloudExchange providers are used in a colocated ExpressRoute model. A VPN gateway isn't used.
    - content: For ExpressRoute to connect to on-premises networks
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: A VPN gateway is a separate resource to Azure ExpressRoute.
    - content: As the cloud connector for the ExpressRoute circuit
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: The ExpressRoute circuit connects to the cloud through an ExpressRoute gateway. 
    - content: As a coexisting connection for failover
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: A VPN gateway can be configured as a failover route if there's a loss of connectivity to an ExpressRoute circuit.
