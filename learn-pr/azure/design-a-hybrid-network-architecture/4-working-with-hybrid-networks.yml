  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: 'Why would you implement a VPN gateway in your Azure virtual network?'
    choices:
    - content: To improve the performance of the ExpressRoute circuit
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: A VPN gateway would be used to provide extra resiliency should the ExpressRoute circuit be unavailable.
    - content: To allow the ExpressRoute circuit to connect to your Azure virtual network
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: The ExpressRoute circuit connects to a Microsoft Enterprise edge router, not to a VPN gateway.
    - content: To allow the ExpressRoute circuit to connect to your on-premises network
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: The ExpressRoute circuit connects to the local edge routers of a connectivity provider.
    - content: To provide a redundant failover connection
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: The VPN gateway provides a direct connection between your on-premises gateway and the Azure virtual network. The VPN gateway can be used if there is an ExpressRoute circuit failure.
  - content: 'How are VPN gateway connections to an on-premises network routed?'
    choices:
    - content: Through a private VPN connection
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: VPN gateways don't use a private connection.
    - content: Over the public internet
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: A VPN gateway sends encrypted traffic between an on-premises network and the Azure network over the public internet.
    - content: Through the Azure datacenter
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: VPN gateways are used to connect to an Azure network in your subscription not to an Azure data-center. 
    - content: By provisioning a traffic manager
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Traffic managers help with routing and traffic filtering but not for on-premises networks.
  - content: 'What is the underlying reason for implementing a hub-spoke architecture?'
    choices:
    - content: Greater cost visibility
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: A hub-spoke architecture can help reduce cost, but it doesn't improve cost visibility.
    - content: Greater security
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: A hub-spoke architecture might be more secure, but it isn't normally considered a benefit.
    - content: Greater business visibility
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: The hub becomes the core of the business and provides the foundations for much deeper business insight.
    - content: Faster network communications
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: A hub-spoke architecture might help increase network speed, but it isn't guaranteed to remove network bottlenecks.
