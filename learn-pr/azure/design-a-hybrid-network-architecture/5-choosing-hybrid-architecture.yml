  questions:
  - content: 'What is a valid use case for Azure ExpressRoute?'
    choices:
    - content: Mission-critical workloads
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: ExpressRoute is the recommended service for mission-critical, large-scale workloads.
    - content: Prototyping
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: ExpressRoute isn't the best connectivity method for prototyping in Azure, because it's expensive and takes time to set up.
    - content: Dev/test workloads
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: ExpressRoute isn't the most suitable connection method for dev/test workloads, because it's expensive and takes time to set up.
    - content: Small production workloads
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: VPN Gateway is better suited for small production workloads and lower traffic throughput.
  - content: 'Why would an organization choose VPN Gateway over Azure ExpressRoute?'
    choices:
    - content: Bandwidth limitations 
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: ExpressRoute has a wide selection of available bandwidths.
    - content: Cost and traffic volume
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: VPN Gateway is less expensive than ExpressRoute and is better suited to smaller traffic volumes.
    - content: Redundancy support
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Both services have redundancy support when they're added to an Azure availability zone.
    - content: Lack of ExpressRoute partners
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: There's a rich ecosystem of system integrators and partners for ExpressRoute.
  - content: 'What is the preferred connection resiliency for ExpressRoute?'
    choices:
    - content: passive-passive
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: ExpressRoute works in an active-active state.
    - content: passive-active
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: ExpressRoute works in an active-active state.
    - content: active-passive
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Although ExpressRoute works in an active-passive state, it works optimally in an active-active state.
    - content: active-active
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Express route uses an active-active connection resiliency.
