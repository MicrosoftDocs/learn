  questions:
  - content: 'Where is a point-to-site VPN connection established?'
    choices:
    - content: The VPN gateway initializes the connection.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: The VPN gateway is a bridge between on-premises or local to the cloud, not where the connection is established.
    - content: The connection is established from the host machine.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: To connect to a host machine, a point-to-site connection needs to be established.
    - content: The connection is established from a client computer.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Point-to-site connections get established from a client machine, such as a desktop computer connecting to the VPN. 
    - content: In an Azure virtual network.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: An Azure virtual network is a virtual communication channel, not where a VPN connection is established.
  - content: 'How is a site-to-site VPN authenticated?'
    choices:
    - content: No authentication is needed.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Authentication between sites is required for secure communications in the network. 
    - content: By using an administrator account.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Storing the credentials for an administrator account in a VPN isn't a secure or supported method for site-to-site VPN connections.
    - content: Through a service principal, in Microsoft Entra ID.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Service principals are used for authentication, but not in site-to-site VPN connections.
    - content: By using an ASCII string secret.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: An ASCII string secret is used to authenticate between the VPN device and the VPN gateway.
  - content: 'When you connect to Azure by using a VPN, which connection method would you use?'
    choices:
    - content: A VPN gateway
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: A VPN gateway must be set up to bridge the connection between on-premises and Azure.
    - content: An encrypted connection
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: All Azure VPN connections get encrypted automatically. There's no requirement to enable encryption.
    - content: An Azure virtual machine
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Several Azure virtual machines are used to host VPN connections, but this hosting is transparent to users.
    - content: A VPN tunnel
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: A VPN tunnel, such as IPsec, is the method for connecting between on-premises and Azure.
