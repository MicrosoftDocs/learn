      explanation: "Azure Container Registry is a private registry and cannot be accessed without authentication."
 
  - content: "Suppose you use container images to run compute workloads in multiple regions throughout the world. You plan to enable the geo-replication feature of Azure Container Registry to decrease the time required to provision an instance. In which regions should you configure the Azure Container Registry geo-replication feature?"
    choices:
    - content: "Place a container registry in the region closest to your development team."
      isCorrect: false

    - content: "Place a container registry in each region where images are run."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Placing a registry in each region that runs the images will ensure network-close registry access everywhere it is needed."
    - content: "Place a container registry in every Azure region."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This will increase costs but will not increase performance."
