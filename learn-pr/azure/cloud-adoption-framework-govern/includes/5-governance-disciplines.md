Common governance disciplines within cloud platforms inform policies, align toolchains, and help organizations to determine how to best automate and enforce corporate policies across their unique cloud platforms.

## Governance disciplines

The following table summarizes each discipline from the Cloud Adoption Framework Govern methodology:

|  |  |
|--|--|
| <br> :::image type="content" source="../media/cost-management-icon.png" alt-text="Cost management icon." border="false"::: | <br> [Cost Management](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/govern/cost-management/?azure-portal=true): Cost is a primary concern for cloud users. Develop policies for cost control for all cloud platforms. |
| <br> :::image type="content" source="../media/security-baseline-icon.png" alt-text="Security baseline icon." border="false"::: | <br> [Security Baseline](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/govern/security-baseline/?azure-portal=true): Security is a complex subject that's unique to each company. Once security requirements are established, cloud governance policies and enforcement apply those requirements across network, data, and asset configurations.|
| <br> :::image type="content" source="../media/identity-baseline-icon.png" alt-text="Identity baseline icon." border="false"::: | <br> [Identity Baseline](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/govern/identity-baseline/?azure-portal=true): Inconsistencies in the application of identity requirements can increase the risk of breach. The Identity Baseline discipline focuses ensuring that identity is consistently applied across cloud adoption efforts. |
| <br> :::image type="content" source="../media/resource-consistency-icon.png" alt-text="Resource consistency icon." border="false"::: | <br> [Resource Consistency](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/govern/resource-consistency/?azure-portal=true): Cloud operations depend on consistent resource configuration. Through governance tooling, resources can be configured consistently to manage risks related to onboarding, drift, discoverability, and recovery. |
| <br> :::image type="content" source="../media/deployment-acceleration-icon.png" alt-text="Deployment acceleration icon." border="false"::: | <br> [Deployment Acceleration](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/govern/deployment-acceleration/?azure-portal=true): Centralization, standardization, and consistency in approaches to deployment and configuration improve governance practices. When provided through cloud-based governance tooling, they create a cloud factor that can accelerate deployment activities. |

## Resource Consistency

Resource consistency focuses on the initial organization of resources required to establish a foundation for governance. Long term, this discipline focuses on proper onboarding processes to ensure that all assets meet any operational support requirements.

This discipline would help Tailwind Traders to address the following risks from the prior unit:

    - Operations management issues or oversights

A future unit in this module will apply this discipline to the early needs of our customer narrative, Tailwind Traders.

## Cost Management

This discipline focuses on scaling the operational best practices for cost management, across all workloads and assets in your portfolio.

This discipline would help Tailwind Traders to address the following risk from the prior unit:

    - Overspending in the cloud

A future unit in this module will demonstrate how Tailwind Traders can add cost controls to their governance foundation.

## Security Baseline

This discipline focuses on automating the application of security principles to ensure consistency across your environment.

_Figure 3: The Security Baseline discipline._

This discipline would help Tailwind Traders to address the following risks from the prior unit:

    - The organization not meeting security or compliance requirements
    - Unauthorized access compromising systems or data

## Identity Baseline

Once you've established identity and access requirements for your cloud environment, this discipline ensures that those requirements are consistently applied to all workloads and assets.

:::image type="content" source="../media/identity-baseline.png" alt-text="The Identity Baseline discipline." border="false":::
_Figure 4: The Identity Baseline discipline._

This discipline would help Tailwind Traders to address the following risk from the prior unit:

    - Unauthorized access compromising systems or data

## Deployment Acceleration

Automating governance leads to automation in adoption. Providing infrastructure-as-code templates to the various adoption teams allows them to quickly deploy workloads into compliant, well-managed environments.

_Figure 5: The Deployment Acceleration discipline._

This discipline would help Tailwind Traders to address the following risk from the prior unit:

    - Inconsistent governance due to immature processes and lack of skills on the team

## Summary

The five disciplines from the Cloud Adoption Framework Governance methodology help to establish the right collection of processes, tools, and automation to address common risks and concerns. Understanding these disciplines can help Tailwind Traders to discover and address tangible risks and concerns and address against a prioritized backlog. 

In the next units, we will explore technical solutions to help you get started with a cloud governance foundation to support each discipline. We'll also look at some technical solutions to address cost-management-related risks.
