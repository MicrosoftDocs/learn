  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "Tailwind Traders currently has this policy in place: 'Customer and financial data can only be hosted in a specific network segment of the existing data centers, referred to as protected assets.' Is this a well-structured, scalable, and actionable policy?"
    choices:
    - content: "Yes"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The policy creates solution dependence and doesn't outline the actual concerns/risks."
    - content: "No"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! This policy would create a number of issues during cloud adoption."
  - content: "Which part of the Cloud Adoption Framework Govern methodology should be the first step to addressing the existing policy?"
    choices:
    - content: "Deploy a governance foundation to set up governance tools in Azure."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The tools could be used to create a similar policy or learn about Azure governance, but they might not solve the deeper issue."
    - content: "Advance the Security Baseline discipline to mimic the on-premises policy in Azure."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "You could get close to meeting this policy requirement with a sound security baseline, but the team would still be bound to keeping sensitive data and apps in the existing data center."
    - content: "Update the corporate policy to address the risks and concerns in non-technical terms."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Learning the tools & addressing security concerns are both important. But no amount of automated tooling can overcome poorly aligned corporate policies."
