Azure Communication Services allows you to easily add real-time multimedia voice, video, and telephony-over-IP communications features to your applications. The Communication Services client libraries also allow you to add chat and SMS functionality to your communications solutions.

You can use Communication Services for voice, video, text, and data communication in a variety of scenarios:

- Browser-to-browser, browser-to-app, and app-to-app communication
- Users interacting with bots or other services
- Users and bots interacting over the public switched telephony network
