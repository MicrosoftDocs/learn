Before considering a move to the cloud, it's a good idea to have a fundamental understanding of the basics of networks, their components, and building blocks.  Networks are made up of many parts including communication protocols, network devices, switches, routers, and more fluid parts like monitoring and network security. Understanding the basic building blocks of a network including the client-server relationship, and the hardware that makes a network possible, is an important step in understanding Azure concepts.

In the second of three network fundamentals modules, you'll be looking at the hardware that makes a network possible. You'll explore various network client options, and the multitude of servers.  Then you'll explore the hardware at the heart of any network, hubs, switches, and routers.

While the contents of this module apply to any network, where possible you'll understand how these concepts apply to Azure.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you'll:

- Understand the difference between clients and servers.
- Understand the difference between hubs, switches, and routers.

## Prerequisites

- Network Fundamentals - Principals
