  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
    - content: "Why did Contoso move their durable function to a lower-tier App Service plan?"
      choices:
        - content: "To improve performance during nightly syncs"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. The move was cost-driven, not performance-driven. The lower-tier plan met existing performance needs."
        - content: "To enable support for multiple programming languages"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. Language support wasn't a factor in the decision."
        - content: "To reduce costs while maintaining required functionality"
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct. The durable function no longer needed the performance and scalability of the original Standard plan. Moving to a lower-tier plan reduced costs without affecting performance."
        - content: "To increase availability across multiple regions"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. The function didn't require multiple-region availability."

    - content: "For cost efficiency, which high availability design should you avoid if you've already paid for the resources?"
      choices:
        - content: "Active-active"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. An active-active design should be used for workloads that are accessed across regions or for workloads that require zero or near-zero downtime."
        - content: "Active-only"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. An active-only design might be sufficient for workloads that have high RPO and RTO targets." 
        - content: "Active-passive"
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct. An active-passive design might lead to paying for idle resources."
        - content: "Passive-only"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. A passive-only design lacks the active components needed to serve traffic or maintain availability, and still incurs cost without delivering value."

    - content: "What change did Contoso make to reduce idle compute costs for their integration function that only runs at night?"
      choices:
        - content: "They moved the function to a Premium App Service plan for better performance"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. This approach increases costs, it doesn't reduce them. Performance wasn't a concern for this workload."
        - content: "They configured the App Service plan to scale down during off-hours"
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct. Contoso realized the function only runs nightly, so they adjusted the App Service plan to scale down when not in use."
        - content: "They enabled geo-redundancy to improve availability"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. Geo-redundancy adds cost and wasn't necessary for this function's availability requirements."
        - content: "They added more instances to handle future growth"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. Adding instances increases cost. The goal was to reduce idle compute usage, not expand capacity."
