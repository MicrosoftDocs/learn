  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
    - content: "Which of these is available for certain Azure compute services to let you save money by paying for only the compute that you use?"
      choices:
        - content: "Azure Advisor cost recommendations"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect.  Azure Advisor cost recommendations provide recommendations about how you can reduce your Azure spend by identifying idle and underutilized resources."
        - content: "Azure Reservations"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. Azure reservations let you prepay for a one-year or three-year term to get a discount on the base compute rate. You can’t pay for only the compute that you use in this model."
        - content: "Azure Hybrid Benefit"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect.  Azure Hybrid Benefit lets you use your on-premises Windows Server or SQL Server licenses with Software Assurance to pay a reduced rate on Azure Virtual Machines. It doesn't affect the cost of resources based on utilization."
        - content: "Consumption-based billing"
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct.  Services like Azure Functions and Azure Container Instances can be configured to use consumption-based billing, which means that you pay only for the compute that you use."

    - content: "Which of the following HA designs should you avoid for cost-efficiency if you’ve already paid for the resources?"
      choices:
        - content: "Active-active"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect.  An active-active design should be used for workloads that are accessed across regions or for workloads that require zero or near-zero downtime."
        - content: "Active-only"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect.  An active-only design may be sufficient for workloads with high RPO and RTO targets." 
        - content: "Active-passive"
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct.  An active-passive design may lead to paying for idle resources."

    - content: "What is one way the workload team can ensure that they catch abandoned resources, like MySQL servers that are no longer used?"
      choices:
        - content: "Review the monthly Azure bill."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect.  The Azure bill won’t provide information about the utilization of a given resource"
        - content: "Setup Azure budget alerts"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect.  Budget alerts only notify users when the budget is exceeded, they can’t provide any information about a given resource's utilization"
        - content: "Review the cost analysis report for the subscription"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect.  The cost analysis report won’t provide information about the utilization of a given resource"
        - content: "Review the Azure Advisor cost recommendations"
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct.  Azure Advisor cost recommendations can identify underutilized MySQL servers and will provide a recommendation when such servers are found."
