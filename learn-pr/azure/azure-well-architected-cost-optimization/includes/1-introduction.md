The Azure Well-Architected Framework is a guide that helps ensure that your workload is: 

- Resilient, available, and recoverable.
- As secure as you need it to be.
- **Worth the investment.**
- Developed and operated responsibly.
- Meeting its goals on time.

Designing an architecture is about supporting your business goals while being mindful of budget and return on investment (ROI). Start with these questions:

- Does your budget actually support what you're trying to achieve?

- How are you spending money on your app and its operations, and where should you focus most?
- Can you get more out of what you already have, either by using it better or reducing what you don't need?

The concepts described in this module aren't all-inclusive of cost optimization in a workload, but they represent the core principles and some of their key approaches. For a complete overview of the Well-Architected Framework pillars, check out the [Well-Architected Framework](/azure/well-architected) as you start planning and designing your architecture.

Each unit in this module dives into one [design principle](/azure/well-architected/cost-optimization/principles) and three approaches for that principle. You can find examples of the approaches in each unit to see how they can be applied to real-world scenarios. The examples are all based on fictional companies.
