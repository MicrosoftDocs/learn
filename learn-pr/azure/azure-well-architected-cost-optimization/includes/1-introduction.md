The Azure Well-Architected Framework is a design framework that can improve the quality of a workload by helping it to:

- Be resilient, available, and recoverable.
- Be as secure as you need it to be.
- **Deliver a sufficient return on investment.**
- Support responsible development and operations.
- Accomplish its purpose within acceptable timeframes.

Architecture design is always driven by business goals and must factor in return on investment (ROI) and financial constraints. Typical questions to consider include:

- Do the allocated budgets enable you to meet your goals?
- What's the spending pattern for the application and its operations? What are priority areas?
- How will you maximize the investment in resources, by better utilization or by reduction?

The concepts described in this module are not all-inclusive of cost optimization in a workload, but they represent the core principles and some of their key approaches when you're designing a workload. For a complete perspective, across all of the Well-Architected Framework pillars, visit the [Azure Well-Architected Framework](/azure/well-architected) as you start planning and designing your architecture.

Each unit in this module focuses on one [design principle](/azure/well-architected/cost-optimization/principles) and three approaches associated with that principle. The approaches in each unit are supported through the use of examples to help demonstrate how they can be applied to real-world scenarios. The examples are all based on a fictional company.

## Learning objectives

By the end of this module, you'll understand the five principles of the Cost Optimization pillar and learn three approaches for each of the following:

- Build a team culture that has awareness of budget, expenses, reporting, and cost tracking
- Spend only on what you need to achieve the highest return on your investments
- Maximize the use of resources and operations
- Increase efficiency without redesigning, renegotiating, or sacrificing requirements
- Continuously right-size investment as your workload evolves

## Prerequisites

- Experience building or operating solutions by using core infrastructure technology such as data storage, compute, and networking
- Experience building or operating technology systems to solve business problems
