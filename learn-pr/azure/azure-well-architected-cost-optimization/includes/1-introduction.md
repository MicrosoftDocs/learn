The Azure Well-Architected Framework is a guide that helps ensure that your workload is: 

- Resilient, available, and recoverable.
- As secure as you need it to be.
- **Worth the investment.**
- Developed and operated responsibly.
- Meeting its goals on time.

When you're designing an architecture, it's always about supporting your business goals while being mindful of budget and return on investment (ROI). Some good questions to ask are:
Architecture design is always driven by business goals and must factor in return on investment (ROI) and financial constraints. Start with these questions:

- Does your budget actually support what you're trying to achieve?

- How are you spending money on the app and its operations, and where should you focus most?
- Can you get more out of what you already have, either by using it better or reducing what you don't need?

The concepts described in this module aren't all-inclusive of reliability in a workload, but they represent the core principles and some of their key approaches. For a complete overview of the Well-Architected Framework pillars, check out the [Azure Well-Architected Framework](/azure/well-architected) as you start planning and designing your architecture.

Each unit in this module dives into one [design principle](/azure/well-architected/cost-optimization/principles) and three approaches for that principle. You can find examples of the approaches in each unit to see how they can be applied to real-world scenarios. The examples are all based on a fictional company.
