In this module, you've looked at the five key principles of the Cost Optimization pillar of the Azure Well-Architected Framework.

A cost-optimized workload isn't necessarily a low-cost workload. There are significant tradeoffs. Tactical approaches are reactive and can reduce costs only in the short term. To achieve long-term financial responsibility, you need to create a strategy with prioritization, continuous monitoring, and repeatable processes that focuses on optimization.

As you prioritize business requirements to align with technology needs, you can adjust costs. However, you should expect a series of tradeoffs in areas in which you want to optimize cost, such as security, scalability, resilience, and operability. If the cost of addressing the challenges in those areas is high and these principles aren't applied properly, you might make risky choices in favor of a cheaper solution, ultimately affecting your organization's business goals and reputation.
