In this module, you learned about the five key principles of the Cost Optimization pillar in the Azure Well-Architected Framework.

A cost-optimized workload isn't necessarily a low-cost workload. There are significant trade-offs. Quick fixes might save money short-term, but for long-term savings, you need a solid plan. It should include prioritization, continuous monitoring, and repeatable processes that focus on optimization.

As you prioritize business requirements to align with technology needs, you can adjust costs. But expect trade-offs in areas like security, scalability, resilience, and operability. If the cost of addressing the challenges in those areas is high and these principles aren't applied properly, you might make risky choices in favor of a cheaper solution. These choices can hurt your goals or reputation.
