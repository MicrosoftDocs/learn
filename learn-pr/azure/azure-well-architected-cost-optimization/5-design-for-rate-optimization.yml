  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
    - content: "Contoso consolidated three AKS clusters into one. What was one of the main benefits of this change?"
      choices:
        - content: "Improved security through network isolation."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Incorrect. Consolidating clusters can actually reduce isolation, not improve it. Separate clusters offer stronger boundaries for security-sensitive workloads."
        - content: "Reduced patching and operational overhead."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Correct. Consolidating clusters reduced the number of nodes and simplified maintenance, saving time and cost."
        - content: "Increased API response times."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. Consolidation doesn't inherently improve performance. In fact, if not managed well, it could introduce resource contention."
        - content: "Enabled multi-region failover."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. Multi-region failover typically requires multiple clusters or services deployed across regions. Consolidation into one cluster doesn't support this approach."

    - content: "When might it be a good idea to switch from consumption-based billing to a fixed-rate billing model?"
      choices:
        - content: "Your workload is heavily used during weekdays and lightly used on weekends."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. In this case, you might be able to scale down your workload on weekends to save money."
        - content: "Your workload is heavily used each morning and moderately used the rest of the day."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. Scaling up to handle the morning peak and scaling down the rest of the day is a better way to save money."
        - content: "Your workload is moderately used all day and night."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct. This scenario could be a good use case for a fixed-rate billing model because the usage pattern is consistent."
        - content: "Your workload is seasonal and is only heavily used for three months of the year."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. You might be able to run your workload with far fewer resources for the other nine months of the year, so a fixed-rate billing model isn't a good fit."

    - content: "Why did Contoso switch their API Management tier from Consumption to Standard?"
      choices:
        - content: "The Standard tier offered better developer tools."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. Developer tools are largely consistent across tiers. The decision was based on networking and cost, not tooling."
        - content: "The Standard tier allowed for private endpoints and was more cost-effective."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct. The team found the Standard tier better aligned with their usage patterns and offered extra network benefits."
        - content: "The Consumption tier didn't support global usage."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. The Consumption tier does support global usage, but it lacks features like virtual network integration and private endpoints."
        - content: "The Standard tier had unlimited scaling."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. The Standard tier supports scaling, but it isn't unlimited. The Consumption tier actually offers more elastic scaling in some scenarios."
