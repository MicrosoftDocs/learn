  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
    - content: "Which of the following scenarios is a good use case for purchasing a reserved instance?"
      choices:
        - content: "My workload is running on VMs and is accessed 24/7."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct.  Purchasing reserved instances for VMs that are running 24/7 is a good way to save money."
        - content: "My workload is running on Azure App Service and is only accessed during business hours."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. Being able to stop the App Service instances when they are not in use is a better way to save money."
        - content: "My workload is running on VMs and will only be in service for six months."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. Reservations can only be purchased on one or three-year terms, so this isn’t a good use case for a reservation."
        - content: "My workload is running on Azure Container Apps and is accessed 24/7."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect.  Azure reservations can’t be purchased for Azure Container Apps."

    - content: "When might it be a good idea to switch from consumption-based billing to a flat-rate billing model?"
      choices:
        - content: "My workload is heavily used during weekdays and lightly used on weekends."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect.  In this case, you may be able to scale down your workload on weekends to save money."
        - content: "My workload is heavily used each morning and moderately used the rest of the day."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect.  Scaling up to handle the morning peak and scaling down the rest of the day is a better way to save money."
        - content: "My workload is moderately used all day and night."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct.  This scenario could be a good use case for a flat-rate billing model because the usage pattern is consistent."
        - content: "My workload is seasonal and is only heavily used for three months of the year."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect.  You may be able to run your workload with far fewer resources for the other 9 months of the year, so a flat-rate billing model is not a good fit."

    - content: "Contoso's SQL databases are spread across multiple VMs, each with its own SQL Server Enterprise license. Which of the following cost-saving measures should Contoso consider?"
      choices:
        - content: "Switch all of the SQL Enterprise licenses to SQL Server Developer."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect.  SQL Server Developer is only for development and testing purposes and can’t be used in production environments."
        - content: "Consolidate the databases onto fewer VMs and apply Azure Hybrid Benefit to each Windows and SQL Server license."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct.  Consolidating the databases onto fewer VMs and applying Azure Hybrid Benefit to each Windows and SQL Server license cuts down the number of VMs and licenses to pay for."
        - content: "Add all of the database servers into an Always On failover cluster."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect.  This scenario may be a good idea for high availability, but it won’t save Contoso any money."
        - content: "Disable SQL backups."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect.  Disabling backups isn’t a good idea because it puts the databases at risk of data loss."
