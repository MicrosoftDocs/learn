  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: 'Your business stores PDF copies of all purchase orders. These files are accessed infrequently after their initial upload, and there is no time criticality associated with their retrieval. Which of the following storage tiers would be the best choice to reduce costs for long-term storage?'
    choices:
    - content: 'Hot access tier'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'The PDF files do not need the increased performance of the hot access tier, so this choice would not be cost-effective.'
    - content: 'Cool access tier'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'This might be a good choice for a transitional storage, but is not a cost-effective choice in the long term.'
    - content: 'Archive access tier'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: 'This choice is the most cost-effective in the long term.'

  - content: 'Which of the following databases would be well suited for elastic pools?'
    choices:
    - content: 'An ERP database that has consistent usage around the clock.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'This database is not a good candidate for elastic pools because it has consistent usage.'
    - content: 'Customer databases that have usage during the same period of time.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'These databases are used during the same time, and are not good candidates for elastic pools.'
    - content: 'Customer databases that are spread across time zones and have periods of intermittent usage.'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: 'Because these databases are used intermittently, their resources could be shared, making them good candidates for elastic pools.'
