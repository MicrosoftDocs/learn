quiz:
  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
    - content: "What types of Azure costs in your cost tracking system can you potentially optimize?"
      choices:
        - content: "Hardware support agreements"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. Your Azure costs only include the cost of the Azure services you use. Hardware support agreements aren't included in your Azure costs."
        - content: "Cloud consulting services"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. Any cloud consulting services you use aren't included in your Azure costs."
        - content: "AWS compute costs"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. AWS costs aren't included in your Azure costs."
        - content: "Azure storage costs"
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct. All Azure services, including Azure Storage accounts, are included in your Azure costs."

    - content: "Which aspect of your workload should you not consider refining based on ROI data?"
      choices:
        - content: "The workload's architecture design"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. The workload's architecture design should be continuously evaluated for refining according to ROI data."
        - content: "Your workload's flows"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. Your workload's flows should be continuously evaluated for refining according to ROI data."
        - content: "Your workload code" 
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. Your workload's code should be continuously evaluated for refining according to ROI data."
        - content: "Your workload's functional and nonfunctional requirements"
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct. The functional and nonfunctional requirements aren't subject to change based on ROI data."

    - content: "What change did Contoso make to reduce unnecessary compute usage without affecting performance?"
      choices:
        - content: "They upgraded to a higher compute SKU to handle peak loads"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. This approach would increase costs, not reduce them. Contoso aimed to optimize usage, not expand it."
        - content: "They switched to a queue-based load leveling system"
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct. They realized they were over-provisioning resources for peak times. By switching to a queue-based load leveling system, they could smooth out demand and reduce compute usage without impacting performance."
        - content: "They added more VMs to their AKS cluster"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. Adding VMs increases capacity and cost. Contoso actually removed unused node pools to save money."
        - content: "They enabled geo-redundancy for all services"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. Geo-redundancy improves availability but adds cost. It wasn't part of their cost-saving strategy."
