Managing data is a critical component of any business. Relational databases, and specifically Microsoft SQL Server, have been among the most common tools for handling that data for decades. 

If we want to manage our data using the cloud, we _can_ just use Azure virtual machines to host our own Microsoft SQL Server instances. Sometimes that's the right solution, but Azure offers another way that's often much easier and more cost effective. Azure SQL databases are a Platform as a Service (PaaS) offering, meaning much less infrastructure and maintenance to manage yourself.

To understand better, let's consider a scenario: you're a software development lead at Contoso Transport, a transportation logistics company.

The transportation industry requires tight coordination among everyone involved: schedulers, dispatchers, drivers, and even customers.

Your current process involves piles of paper forms and hours on the phone to coordinate shipments. You find that paperwork is often missing signatures and dispatchers are frequently unavailable. These holdups leave drivers sitting idle; as a result, some important shipments arrive late.

Customer satisfaction and repeat business are crucial to your bottom line, so your team decides to move from paper forms and phone calls to digital documents and online communication. Going digital will enable everyone to coordinate and track shipment times through their web browser or mobile app.

You want to quickly prototype something to share with your team. Your prototype will include a database to hold driver, customer, and order information. Your prototype will be the basis for your production app, so the technology choices you make now should carry over to what your team delivers.
