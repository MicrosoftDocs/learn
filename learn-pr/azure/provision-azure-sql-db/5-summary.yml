quiz:
    title: Check your knowledge
    questions:
    - content: "Who's responsible for performing software updates on your Azure SQL databases and the underlying OS?"
      choices:
      - content: "You are. It's up to you to periodically install the latest security patches and updates."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Azure SQL databases are a Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) offering, meaning much less maintenance to manage yourself."
      - content: "Microsoft Azure. Azure manages the hardware, software updates, and OS patches for you."
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "Azure SQL databases are a Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) offering. Azure manages the hardware, software updates, and OS patches for you."
      - content: "No one. Your database stays with its original OS and software configuration."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Azure SQL databases are a Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) offering. The cloud provider typically manages and updates PaaS services for you."
    - content: "What is an *Azure SQL logical server*?"
      choices:
      - content: "An administrative container for your databases."
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "You can control logins, firewall rules, and security policies through the logical SQL server."
      - content: "Another name for the Azure SQL Managed Instance service."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Azure SQL Managed Instance is a different Azure service. You can manage multiple databases in a single Azure SQL Database logical server."
      - content: "A server that defines the rules that sort and compare text."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "The logical SQL server doesn't contain this information. Each database does. *Collation* refers to the rules that sort and compare character data in tables. You can manage multiple databases in a single Azure SQL Database logical server."
    - content: "Your Azure SQL database provides adequate storage and memory. But you find that you need more CPU capacity. Which should you use?"
      choices:
      - content: "DTU"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "DTU, or Database Transaction Unit, provides a simple, preconfigured purchase option. To increase CPU capacity, you would need to move to a higher tier. The higher tier increases your storage and memory as well, things you don't need. A more customizable option for your workload would be to use the vCore purchasing model."
      - content: "vCore"
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "vCore gives you greater control over what compute and storage resources you create and pay for. You can increase vCore capacity throughput but keep the existing amount of compute and storage."
      - content: "SQL elastic pool"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "SQL elastic pools enable you to buy a set of compute and storage resources that are shared among all the databases in the pool. This option doesn't help with an individual database's CPU performance because you're working with just one database. If you had multiple databases, paying for a single elastic pool for many database workloads could provide higher performance capacity and consolidated billing, depending on your utilization patterns."
