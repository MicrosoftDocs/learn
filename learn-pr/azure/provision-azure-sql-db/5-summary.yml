    title: Check your knowledge
    questions:
    - content: "Who's responsible for performing software updates on your Azure SQL databases and the underlying OS?"
      choices:
      - content: "You are. It's up to you to periodically install the latest security patches and updates."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Azure SQL databases are a Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) offering, meaning much less maintenance to manage yourself."
      - content: "Microsoft Azure. Azure manages the hardware, software updates, and OS patches for you."
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "Azure SQL databases are a Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) offering. Azure manages the hardware, software updates, and OS patches for you."
      - content: "No one. Your database stays with its original OS and software configuration."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Azure SQL databases are a Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) offering. The cloud provider typically manages and updates PaaS services for you."
    - content: "What is an _Azure SQL logical server_?"
      choices:
      - content: "An administrative container for your databases."
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "You can control logins, firewall rules, and security policies through the logical server."
      - content: "Another name for the Azure SQL Managed Instance service."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Remember that you can have multiple databases. You can manage multiple databases in a single Azure SQL Database logical server. Azure SQL Managed Instance is a different Azure service."
      - content: "A server that defines the logical rules that sort and compare data."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "_Collation_ refers to the rules that sort and compare data in tables. You can manage multiple databases in a single Azure SQL Database logical server."
    - content: "Your Azure SQL database provides adequate storage and compute power. But you find that you need more IO throughput. Which performance model might you use?"
      choices:
      - content: "DTU"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "DTU, or Database Transaction Unit, provides a simple, preconfigured purchase option. To increase IO throughput, you would need to move to a higher tier. The higher tier increases your storage and compute power, things you don't need."
      - content: "vCore"
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "vCore gives you greater control over what compute and storage resources you create and pay for. You can increase IO throughput but keep the existing amount of compute and storage."
      - content: "SQL elastic pool"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "SQL elastic pools enable you to buy a set of compute and storage resources that are shared among all the databases in the pool. This option doesn't help with IO performance because you're working with just one database."
