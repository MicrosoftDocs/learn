  - content: "True or False: to be carbon-efficient is to minimize the amount of carbon emitted per unit of work."
    choices:
    - content: "True"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "As discussed under the Carbon Efficiency principle, the focus of sustainable software engineering is to build applications that are carbon efficient to minimize the amount of carbon emitted into the atmosphere."
    - content: "False"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "As discussed under the Carbon Efficiency principle, the focus of sustainable software engineering is to build applications that are carbon efficient to minimize the amount of carbon emitted into the atmosphere."
  - content: "What is the single most significant cause of carbon emissions?"
    choices:
    - content: "Agriculture"
      isCorrect: false

    - content: "Energy supply"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Energy supply is the single most significant cause of carbon emission at 29.3% of all greenhouse gas emissions."
    - content: "Waste management"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Energy supply is the single most significant cause of carbon emission at 29.3% of all greenhouse gas emissions. Waste management is responsible for 3.2% of greenhouse gas emissions."
    - content: "International aviation"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Energy supply is the single most significant cause of carbon emission at 29.3% of all greenhouse gas emissions. International aviation is responsible for 3% of greenhouse gas emissions."
  - content: "True or False: reducing the amount of electricity consumed in your application can decrease the carbon intensity of the local grids energy mix."
    choices:
    - content: "True"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "From the applications running on your smartphone to the training of machine learning models running in data centers, all software consumes electricity in its execution. One of the best ways to reduce electricity consumption and the subsequent emissions of carbon pollution made by software is to make applications more energy-efficient. Therefore, the second principle of Sustainable Software Engineering is to build applications that are energy-efficient."
    - content: "False"
      isCorrect: false
