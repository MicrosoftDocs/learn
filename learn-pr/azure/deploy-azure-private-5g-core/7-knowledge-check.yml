  - content: "If a customer prefers to provide their own key for encryption, they must select:"
    choices:
    - content: Customer-managed keys
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. Customer-managed keys are used to encrypt all the SIM secrets that get added to the corresponding SIM group.
    - content: Microsoft-managed keys
      isCorrect: false
