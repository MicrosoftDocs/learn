Transport encryption helps protect application data while it's in transit from users to your servers. This encryption prevents unauthorized users from seeing the transmitted data.

Consider the example of a retail organization that has a new shipping portal. The organization is publishing this portal and making it available over the internet to allow vendors to ship customer items and track status. This portal exposes business and customer data. The data needs to be encrypted between users and the backend application. This encryption ensures that data isn't captured by an unauthorized user during transmission. The organization has implemented Azure Application Gateway to load balance traffic. The organization now needs to enable SSL encryption between users and its servers.

This module shows you how to encrypt traffic with SSL by using Application Gateway.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you will:

- Implement SSL encryption between users and Application Gateway.
- Implement SSL encryption between Application Gateway and your web servers.

## Prerequisites

- An active Azure subscription
