Transport encryption helps to protect application data while in transit from the user to your servers. This prevents unauthorized users from seeing the transmitted data.

Consider the example of a retail organization that has a new shipping portal. The organization is publishing this portal and making it available over the Internet to allow vendors to ship customer items and track status. This portal exposes business and customer data. The data needs to be encrypted between the user and the back-end application to ensure this data is not captured by an unauthorized user while it's transmitted over the network. The organization has implemented Application Gateway to load balance traffic. The organization now needs to enable SSL encryption between the user and their servers.

This module shows you how to encrypt traffic with SSL using the Application Gateway.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you will:

- Implement SSL encryption between your end users and Application Gateway
- Implement SSL encryption between Application Gateway and your web server
