  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "What are the benefits of using Application Gateway to help protect traffic sent to or from your applications?"
    choices:
    - content: "Application Gateway can implement an SSL connection with clients. There's no need to encrypt data sent from the gateway to the servers running your application."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "No. Although Application Gateway can use SSL to help protect communications with clients, you still need to encrypt data that passes between Application Gateway and the servers running your application."
    - content: "Application Gateway can implement an SSL connection with clients. Application Gateway can also implement an SSL connection with the servers running your application."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "This answer is correct."
    - content: "Application Gateway doesn't require an SSL connection with clients. All encryption is carried out by the connection with the servers running your application."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "No. You should configure Application Gateway to use SSL to communicate with clients and for connecting to the servers running your application."
    - content: "Application Gateway automatically protects the communications between clients and the servers running your application. You don't need to do any additional configuration."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "No. You must configure SSL for incoming requests from clients to Application Gateway, and for traffic transmitted between Application Gateway and the servers running your application."
  - content: "Which of the following can't be placed in the backend pool of an application gateway?"
    choices:
    - content: "Azure App Service"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Azure App Service can be placed in a backend pool."
    - content: "Azure virtual machines"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Azure virtual machines can be placed in a backend pool."
    - content: "Azure Cosmos DB"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Azure Cosmos DB can't be placed in a backend pool."
    - content: "Azure virtual machine scale sets"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Azure virtual machine scale sets can be placed in a backend pool."
