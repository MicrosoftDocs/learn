Google Cloud Platform (GCP) is similar to Microsoft Azure in that it offers a growing range of AI, compute, storage, database, and other services. Although these platforms have similarities in their capabilities, the implementations of their cloud services are often different. When you're planning a migration for some or all of your workloads, you need to understand important concepts, such as identity and access management (IAM), governance, infrastructure as a service (IaaS), and storage.

Suppose you work for a global cycling retailer. You host most of your business-critical systems on GCP. A recent merger with a retailing competitor requires you to understand its cloud systems, which are hosted on Azure. You want to investigate the differences and similarities between Azure and GCP. And you want to determine how systems equivalent to your GCP architecture can be deployed in Azure.

In this module, you learn about key areas in Azure and how they map to Google Cloud services.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you will:

- Learn about IAM in Azure compared to GCP.
- Compare governance services on GCP with Azure.
- Learn about the differences between GCP and Azure IaaS options.
- Compare database services in GCP with Azure.
- Compare event-driven architecture and messaging services in GCP and Azure.
- Compare Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) and Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).
- Learn where to find more information about GCP-equivalent Azure services.
