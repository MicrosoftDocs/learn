quiz:
  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
    - content: Which layer of the OSI model does Azure Load Balancer function at?
      choices:
        - content: Layer 4
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: Correct. Load Balancer functions at Layer 4 (transport layer) of the OSI model.
        - content: Layer 7
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. Load Balancer functions at Layer 4 of the OSI model. Other Azure services, such as Azure Application Gateway, can load balance traffic at Layer 7.
        - content: Layer 5
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. Azure Load Balancer functions at Layer 4 of the OSI model. Layer 5 of the OSI model is the session layer that addresses opening, closing, and managing application sessions.  
    - content: Which of the following components should you configure to ensure that traffic from a specific client computer is always directed to the same server in the back-end pool?
      choices: 
        - content: Health probe
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. Health probes allow you to determine whether a back-end pool instance is responding to traffic.
        - content: High availability port
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. High availability ports are a type of rule in which all TCP and UDP traffic that arrives on all ports is load balanced.
        - content: Session persistence
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: Correct. Session persistence allows you to ensure that traffic from a client computer interacting with Azure Load Balancer is always forwarded to the same server in the back-end pool.
    - content: Which of the following components would you configure to ensure that back-end pool instances that are no longer responding to traffic on TCP port 443 no longer have traffic directed to them by Load Balancer?
      choices:
        - content: High availability port
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. High availability ports are a type of rule in which all TCP and UDP traffic that arrives on all ports is load balanced.
        - content: Outbound rule
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. Outbound rules are used to configure traffic flow from back-end pool instances to the internet.
        - content: Health probe
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: Correct. Health probes allow you to determine whether a back-end pool instance is responding to traffic.
