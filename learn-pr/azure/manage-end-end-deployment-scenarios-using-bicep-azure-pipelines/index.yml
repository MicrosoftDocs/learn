title: Manage end-to-end deployment scenarios by using Bicep and Azure Pipelines
summary: |
  Create a unified pipeline to deploy your entire environment. You'll add a build stage to your pipeline, and use pipeline artifacts and Bicep outputs to publish applications, databases, and blobs.
abstract: |
  After completing this module, you'll be able to:
    - Deploy Azure infrastructure, applications, database scripts, and storage blobs from a single pipeline
    - Use pipeline scripts and pipeline tasks to perform deployment steps
    - Use pipeline artifacts to publish compiled files for your deployment pipeline stages to use
    - Pass data from your Bicep files to other deployment steps by using outputs
prerequisites: |
  You should be familiar with using:

  - Bicep, including child resources, and how to deploy Bicep files to Azure.
  - Azure, including the Azure portal, subscriptions, resource groups, and resources.
  - Basic Git commands, including cloning, committing files, and pushing changes to Azure Repos.
  - YAML pipelines through Azure Pipelines, including multistage pipelines, environments, and service connections.

  To work through the exercises in the module, you'll need:

  - An Azure account, with the ability to create resource groups, Azure Active Directory applications, and service principals.
  - An Azure DevOps organization and account.

  To work through the exercises, you'll also need the following installed locally:

  - [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com).
  - The [Bicep extension for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-bicep).
  - The [Azure Pipelines extension for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azure-devops.azure-pipelines).
  - The latest [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) tools *or* the latest [Azure PowerShell](/powershell/azure/install-az-ps).
