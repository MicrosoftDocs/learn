      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Although this can be a quick approach to duplicate assets, it's still a manual approach and requires manual manipulation after to copy-paste."
    - content: "Develop a ScriptableObject to create assets at runtime based on a core Prefab"
      isCorrect: true

      isCorrect: false
      explanation: ""
    - content: "False"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "A device simulator isn't required for all Digital Twins to connect assets to ADT.  Often, when developers are creating digital representations of physical assets or processes, they have access to rich IoT, enterprise, and other data sources relevant to their Digital Twins."
