Data visualization is a method for creating dashboards, reports, and real-time insights. Elastic Cloud offers a built-in visualization tool, Kibana, that deploys automatically. For Tailwind Traders, you want to demo how analysts will be able to use Kibana to visualize data in Elastic. This unit walks through the basics steps on how to add a preloaded sample data to Elastic so your teams can get started exploring.

## Kibana Canvas enables data visualization

Kibana is a window into the Elastic Stack for data consumers and operators of Elastic alike. Kibana Canvas, the name of the app itself, allows you to visualize Kibana data. Exploring Kibana Canvas provides a peek into the art of what's possible when it comes to visualizing data with Elasticsearch.

## Kibana alerts you to ML-based insights

With the Kibana Alerting function, you can create Machine Learning jobs on the data in Elasticsearch. You'll receive notifications in your Kibana app of any interesting moments that the model detects.

## Kibana is accessed using your Elastic credentials

During the previous deployment exercise, you should have been prompted to copy or download a .csv file that includes your Elastic credentials and password. You'll need these credentials to access Kibana. You can reset the password at any time through the Elastic Search Console.
