  questions:
  - content: "When you're preparing multitenant tables for migration from a single-node database to a multi-node cluster, what classification is applied to tables that can be logically distributed by the chosen distribution column, but which doesn't contain a column that directly references it?"
    choices:
    - content: "Ready for distribution"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Try again. Tables that are classified as ready for distribution already contain the distribution column and are ready to be distributed without changes."
    - content: "Needs backfill"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! Tables that are in this category require denormalization to add the selected distribution column, which must then be backfilled with the appropriate value."
    - content: "Reference table"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Try again. Reference tables are typically small, don't contain the distribution key, are commonly joined by distributed tables, and are shared across tenants."
    - content: "Local table"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Try again. Local tables are typically not joined to other tables and don't contain the distribution key."
  - content: "Which distribution function is the safest to use for write-intensive tables when migrating a production multitenant database from a single node to a multi-node cluster?"
    choices:
    - content: "`concurrently_distribute_table()`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Try again. This function doesn't exist."
    - content: "`create_distributed_table()`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Try again. This method results in table locking and can prevent writes against the table until the distribution process completes."
    - content: "`create_distributed_table_concurrently()`"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! Running `create_distributed_table_concurrently()` takes longer to complete but is a safer option when working with production systems, in which reducing the impact on ongoing application operations is essential."
  - content: "When you're monitoring activity in a multitenant SaaS database, the ability to view database usage and statistics on a per-tenant basis is crucial. What built-in view allows you to get clear insights into what your tenants are doing?"
    choices:
    - content: "citus_stat_statements"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! The citus_stat_statements view tracks queries issues against distributed tables in the database, including what distribution key value the query targeted."
    - content: "citus_dist_stat_activity"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Try again. The citus_dist_stat_activity view shows the distributed queries that are executing on all nodes."
    - content: "pg_stat_statements"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Try again. The pg_stat_statements view tracks queries issues against the database and provides query timing details, but it doesn't capture the tenant ID that's associated with each query."
