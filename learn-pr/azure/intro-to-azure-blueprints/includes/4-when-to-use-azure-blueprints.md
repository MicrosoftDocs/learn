Overall, we recommend using Azure Blueprints whenever you have a new project to be deployed and you need to ensure the enforcement of minimal governance rules on it. With Azure Blueprints, you can build a blueprint that enables repeatable deployments, orchestration, security, and control to be adherent within your governance strategy.

Also, keep in mind that those blueprints are like a package that you can use with your continuous integration and continuous deployment pipelines to deliver governance as code, allowing you to be fully aligned with your DevOps approach.
