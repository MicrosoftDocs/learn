You want to ensure that you can connect clients or sites within your environment into Azure using encrypted tunnels across the public internet. In this unit, you'll create a point-to-site VPN gateway, and then connect to that gateway from your client computer. You'll use native Azure certificate authentication connections for security.

You'll carry out the following process:

1. Create a RouteBased VPN gateway.

1. Upload the public key for a root certificate for authentication purposes.

1. Generate a client certificate from the root certificate, then install the client certificate on each client computer that will connect to the virtual network for authentication purposes.

1. Create VPN client configuration files, which contain the necessary information for the client to connect to the virtual network.

## Setup

To complete this module, use Azure PowerShell from your local Windows computer.

1. Open a new PowerShell session on your local Windows computer where you installed the Azure PowerShell module.

1. Sign in to Azure by running the PowerShell cmdlet `Connect-AzAccount`.

1. Set up variables you'll use to create a virtual network. Copy and paste in the following variables into PowerShell.

```PowerShell
$VNetName  = "VNetData"
$FESubName = "FrontEnd"
$BESubName = "Backend"
$GWSubName = "GatewaySubnet"
$VNetPrefix1 = "192.168.0.0/16"
$VNetPrefix2 = "10.254.0.0/16"
$FESubPrefix = "192.168.1.0/24"
$BESubPrefix = "10.254.1.0/24"
$GWSubPrefix = "192.168.200.0/26"
$VPNClientAddressPool = "172.16.201.0/24"
$ResourceGroup = "VpnGatewayDemo"
$Location = "East US"
$GWName = "VNetDataGW"
$GWIPName = "VNetDataGWPIP"
$GWIPconfName = "gwipconf"
```

## Configure a virtual network

1. Run the following command to create a resource group.

    ```PowerShell
    New-AzResourceGroup -Name $ResourceGroup -Location $Location
    ```

1. Run the following command to create subnet configurations for the virtual network. These configurations have the name **FrontEnd, BackEnd**, and **GatewaySubnet**. All of these subnets exist within the virtual network prefix.

    ```PowerShell
    $fesub = New-AzVirtualNetworkSubnetConfig -Name $FESubName -AddressPrefix $FESubPrefix
    $besub = New-AzVirtualNetworkSubnetConfig -Name $BESubName -AddressPrefix $BESubPrefix
    $gwsub = New-AzVirtualNetworkSubnetConfig -Name $GWSubName -AddressPrefix $GWSubPrefix
    ```

1. Next, run the following command to create the virtual network using the subnet values and a static DNS server.

    ```PowerShell
    New-AzVirtualNetwork -Name $VNetName -ResourceGroupName $ResourceGroup -Location $Location -AddressPrefix $VNetPrefix1,$VNetPrefix2 -Subnet $fesub, $besub, $gwsub -DnsServer 10.2.1.3
    ```

1. Now specify the variables for this network that you've created.

    ```PowerShell
    $vnet = Get-AzVirtualNetwork -Name $VNetName -ResourceGroupName $ResourceGroup
    $subnet = Get-AzVirtualNetworkSubnetConfig -Name $GWSubName -VirtualNetwork $vnet
    ```

1. Run the following command to request a dynamically assigned public IP address.

    ```PowerShell
    $pip = New-AzPublicIpAddress -Name $GWIPName -ResourceGroupName $ResourceGroup -Location $Location -AllocationMethod Static -Sku Standard -Zone 1,2,3
    $ipconf = New-AzVirtualNetworkGatewayIpConfig -Name $GWIPconfName -Subnet $subnet -PublicIpAddress $pip
    ```

## Create the VPN gateway

When creating this VPN gateway:

- GatewayType must be **Vpn**.
- VpnType must be **RouteBased**.

This part of the exercise can take up to 45 minutes to complete.

1. To create the VPN gateway, run the following command, and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.

    ```PowerShell
    New-AzVirtualNetworkGateway -Name $GWName -ResourceGroupName $ResourceGroup `
    -Location $Location -IpConfigurations $ipconf -GatewayType Vpn `
    -VpnType RouteBased -EnableBgp $false -GatewaySku VpnGw1AZ -VpnClientProtocol "IKEv2"
    ```

1. Wait for the command output to appear.

## Add the VPN client address pool

1. Run the following command to add the VPN client address pool.

    ```PowerShell
    $Gateway = Get-AzVirtualNetworkGateway -ResourceGroupName $ResourceGroup -Name $GWName
    Set-AzVirtualNetworkGateway -VirtualNetworkGateway $Gateway -VpnClientAddressPool $VPNClientAddressPool
    ```

1. Wait for the command output to appear.

## Generate a client certificate

With the network infrastructure created on Azure, we need to create a self-signed client certificate on our local machine. This creation process is similar most operating systems, but we'll cover how to generate your client certificate on Windows using PowerShell with the Azure PowerShell module and the Windows **Certificate Manager** utility.

1. Our first step is to create the self-signed root certificate. Run the following command.

    ```PowerShell
    $cert = New-SelfSignedCertificate -Type Custom -KeySpec Signature `
    -Subject "CN=P2SRootCert" -KeyExportPolicy Exportable `
    -HashAlgorithm sha256 -KeyLength 2048 `
    -CertStoreLocation "Cert:\CurrentUser\My" -KeyUsageProperty Sign -KeyUsage CertSign
    ```

1. Next, generate a client certificate signed by your new root certificate.

    ```PowerShell
    New-SelfSignedCertificate -Type Custom -DnsName P2SChildCert -KeySpec Signature `
    -Subject "CN=P2SChildCert" -KeyExportPolicy Exportable `
    -HashAlgorithm sha256 -KeyLength 2048 `
    -CertStoreLocation "Cert:\CurrentUser\My" `
    -Signer $cert -TextExtension @("2.5.29.37={text}1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.2")
    ```

## Export certificate public key

With our certificates generated, we need to export our root certificate's public key.

1. Run `certmgr` from PowerShell to open the Certificate Manager.

1. Go to **Personal** > **Certificates**.

1. Right-click the **P2SRootCert** certificate in the list, and select **All tasks** > **Export**.

1. In the Certificate Export Wizard, select **Next**.

1. Ensure that **No, do not export the private key** is selected, and then select **Next**.

1. On the **Export File Format** page, ensure that **Base-64 encoded X.509 (.CER)** is selected, and then select **Next**.

1. In the **File to Export** page, under **File name**, navigate to a location you'll remember, and save the file as **P2SRootCert.cer**, and then select **Next**.

1. On the **Completing the Certificate Export Wizard** page, select **Finish**.

1. On the **Certificate Export Wizard** message box, select **OK**.

## Upload the root certificate public key information

1. In the PowerShell window, run the following command to declare a variable for the certificate name.

    ```PowerShell
    $P2SRootCertName = "P2SRootCert.cer"
    ```

1. Replace the `<cert-path>` placeholder with the export location of your root certificate, then run the following command.

    ```PowerShell
    $filePathForCert = "<cert-path>\P2SRootCert.cer"
    $cert = new-object System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates.X509Certificate2($filePathForCert)
    $CertBase64 = [system.convert]::ToBase64String($cert.RawData)
    $p2srootcert = New-AzVpnClientRootCertificate -Name $P2SRootCertName -PublicCertData $CertBase64
    ```

1. With the group name set, upload the certificate to Azure with the following command.

    ```PowerShell
    Add-AzVpnClientRootCertificate -VpnClientRootCertificateName $P2SRootCertName -VirtualNetworkGatewayname $GWName -ResourceGroupName $ResourceGroup -PublicCertData $CertBase64
    ```

    Azure will now recognize this certificate as a trusted root certificate for our virtual network.

## Configure the native VPN client

1. Run the following command to create VPN client configuration files in .ZIP format.

    ```PowerShell
    $profile = New-AzVpnClientConfiguration -ResourceGroupName $ResourceGroup -Name $GWName -AuthenticationMethod "EapTls"
    $profile.VPNProfileSASUrl
    ```

1. Copy the URL returned in this command's output and paste it into your browser. Your browser should start downloading a .ZIP file. Extract the archive contents and put them in a suitable location.

   Some browsers will initially attempt to block downloading this ZIP file as a dangerous download. You'll need to override this in your browser to be able to extract the archive contents.

1. In the extracted folder, navigate to either the **WindowsAmd64** folder (for 64-bit Windows computers) or the **WindowsX86** folder (for 32-bit computers).

    If you want to configure a VPN on a non-Windows machine, you can use the certificate and settings files from the **Generic** folder.

1. Double-click the **VpnClientSetup{architecture}.exe** file, with `{architecture}` reflecting your architecture.

1. In the **Windows protected your PC** screen, select **More info**, then select **Run anyway**.

1. In the **User Account Control** dialog box, select **Yes**.

1. In the **VNetData** dialog box, select **Yes**.

## Connect to Azure

1. Press the <kbd>Windows</kbd> key, enter **Settings**, and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.

1. In the **Settings** window, select **Network and Internet**.

1. In the left-hand pane, select **VPN**.

1. In the right-hand pane, select **VNetData**, and then select **Connect**.

1. In the VNetData window, select **Connect**.

1. In the next VNetData window, select **Continue**.

1. In the **User Account Control** message box, select **Yes**.

 If these steps don't work, you might need to restart your computer.

## Verify your connection

1. In a new Windows command prompt, run `IPCONFIG /ALL`.

1. Copy the IP address under PPP adapter VNetData, or write it down.

1. Confirm that IP address is in the **VPNClientAddressPool range of 172.16.201.0/24**.

1. You've successfully made a connection to the Azure VPN gateway.

You just set up a VPN gateway, enabling you to make an encrypted client connection to a virtual network in Azure. This approach is great with client computers and smaller site-to-site connections.
