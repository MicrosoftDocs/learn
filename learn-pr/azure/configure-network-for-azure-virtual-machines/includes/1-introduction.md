Suppose you work as a network architect at a global pharmaceutical company that sequences genes to create formulas for proprietary and commercially confidential medicines. Your manufacturing plants around the world use these formulas. The company wants to implement Microsoft Azure and transfer part of its gene-sequencing functions into cloud-based virtual machines. The gene-sequencing results need to be available to several regions around the world. Data processing is currently carried out in on-premises datacenters, with virtual private networking (VPN) used to connect the datacenters in each region.

You've been tasked to assess how Microsoft Azure implements networking, and to identify whether it will provide suitable security for the transfer of data. Secure data transfer is required between your on-premises datacenter and Microsoft Azure, and between Microsoft Azure regions. You'll use Azure Virtual Network, Azure VPN Gateway, and Azure ExpressRoute technologies.

## Learning objectives

By the end of this module, you'll be able to:

- Create an Azure Virtual Network.
- Create an Azure VPN Gateway.
- Identify the features and benefits of Azure ExpressRoute.

> The exercises in this module require a full Azure subscription. The exercises are optional and aren't required to complete this module. Participating in the interactive exercises in this module will result in charges billed to the Azure subscription you use to complete them. You can minimize incurred charge by cleaning up the resources you create as soon as possible. We've included cleanup directions in the final unit.
