  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: 'You need to connect Azure resources like Azure virtual machines across geographical regions. Which Azure networking option should you use?'
    choices:
    - content: "Azure ExpressRoute"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "ExpressRoute allows you to extend your on-premises networks into the Microsoft Cloud over a private connection implemented by a connectivity provider."
    - content: "VPN Gateway"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "An Azure virtual network gateway provides an endpoint for incoming connections from on-premises locations to Azure over the Internet."
    - content: "Virtual network peering"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Use virtual network peering to connect virtual networks to each other so resources in either virtual network can communicate with each other. The virtual networks you connect can be in different Azure regions."
  - content: 'For a point-to-site Azure VPN gateway, what are the key parameters that you must specify when you create it?'
    choices:
    - content: "Gateway type is **Vpn** and vpn type is **RouteBased**."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Those are key parameters but you also need to specify a gateway sku. The default is VpnGw1. If that SKU doesn't meet your organization's needs, you'd have to recreate the VPN gateway with the SKU that meets your organization's network requirements."
    - content: "Gateway type is **Vpn**, vpn type is **RouteBased**, and you need to specify a gateway sku."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Use the PowerShell cmdlet 'New-AzVirtualNetworkGateway' where you use parameters '-GatewayType Vpn' and '-VpnType RouteBased'. Also set the '-GatewaySku' to the SKU that meets your organization's network requirements."
    - content: "Subnet is **GatewaySubnet** and gateway type is **Vpn**"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "You must create a gateway subnet with the name **GatewaySubnet** in order for the VPN gateway to function properly. But when you create the VPN gateway with the cmdlet 'New-AzVirtualNetworkGateway', you specify the '-IpConfigurations' for that subnet."
  - content: 'Which peering configuration would you use for your ExpressRoute circuit where you need to allow direct connections to Azure compute resources?'
    choices:
    - content: "Azure Virtual Network peering"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Virtual network peering allows you to connect networks in Azure Virtual Network."
    - content: "Azure private peering"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Azure private peering lets you directly connect to virtual machines and cloud services on their private IP addresses."
    - content: "Microsoft peering"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Microsoft peering supports connections to cloud-based SaaS offerings, such as Microsoft 365 and Dynamics 365."
  - content: 'Which protocol provides dynamic routing for Azure ExpressRoute?'
    choices:
    - content: "IPVPN"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "An Any-to-any (IPVPN) network is a connectivity model that ExpressRoute supports."
    - content: "Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Border Gateway Protocol is an industry-standard dynamic routing protocol that can exchange routes between your on-premises network, your instances in Azure, and Microsoft public addresses."
    - content: "S-key"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "An s-key is a GUID that defines an ExpressRoute circuit and provides the connectivity link between Microsoft, your connectivity provider, and your organization."
