You can add custom domain names to Microsoft Entra ID. After you add the domain names, your employees can use memorable and branded usernames to access your company's resources.

Your organization used Azure to develop and test a pilot project. It has now decided to make Azure available to the entire company. You're the organization's Global Administrator in Microsoft Entra ID. You're going to set up accounts for all your employees.

You want to create usernames that are familiar to your users. Their Azure sign-in names need to be memorable. Also, their Microsoft Entra accounts should clearly be associated with your organization.
