Azure Backup provides a set of built-in metrics via Azure Monitor that you can use to monitor the health of your backups. It also allows you to configure alert rules that trigger when the metrics exceed defined thresholds.

Azure Backup offers the following key capabilities:

- View out-of-the-box metrics and trends related to the backup and restore health of your backup items.
- Write custom alert processing rules that are based on these metrics to efficiently monitor the health of your backup items.
- Route fired metric alerts to different notification channels that Azure Monitor supports, such as email, ITSM, webhook, and logic apps.
