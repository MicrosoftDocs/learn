You've been responsible for getting your SQL Server instance fast, keeping it fast, and making it fast again when something is wrong. In this module, we'll show you how to use your existing performance skills, processes, and tools to apply them to Azure SQL. This includes taking advantage of the intelligence in Azure to deliver consistent performance for your application.

## Learning objectives

At the end of this module, you will be able to:

* Identify and use the performance capabilities of Azure SQL.
* Configure and maintain performance for Azure SQL.
* Monitor and troubleshoot performance in Azure SQL.
* Accelerate and tune performance in Azure SQL.
* Use intelligent performance.

## Prerequisites  

* Experience working with, maintaining, and developing with SQL Server.
* Experience with Azure, such as deploying and managing resources.

For the exercises, we provide a sandbox environment for Azure resources. However, you need to do a few things on your local machine in order to complete the exercises:  

* Use a Windows machine or VM (SQL Server Management Studio is only available on Windows).  
* Download and install [the latest version of SQL Server Management Studio](/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms?azure-portal=true).
* Download and install [the latest version of Azure Data Studio](/sql/azure-data-studio/download-azure-data-studio?azure-portal=true).
* Download the [zip file](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/mslearn-azure-sql-fundamentals/archive/master.zip?azure-portal=true) or clone the repository from [GitHub](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/mslearn-azure-sql-fundamentals?azure-portal=true) to access lab files. Extract the contents of the zip file to something similar to `C:\Users\[YourUsername]\` so you can access it easily in the exercises.

If you can't complete the prerequisites, you can still go through the module and see demos of the exercises.
