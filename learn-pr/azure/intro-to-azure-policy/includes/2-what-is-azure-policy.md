Azure Policy is a service that you use to create, assign, and manage policy definitions. Policy definitions impose different rules and actions on your resources, so that those resources remain in compliance with your corporate standards and service-level agreements. The policy focuses on both the properties of resources during deployment and for existing resources. It performs an assessment of your resources, checking those resources that don't conform to your policy definitions.

In summary, you use Azure Policy to:

- Enforce compliance:
  - Use built-in policies or build custom policies for all resource types.
  - Perform real-time policy evaluation and enforcement.
  - Perform periodic and on-demand compliance evaluation.
- Apply policies at scale
  - Apply policies to a Management Group with control across your entire organization.
  - Apply multiple policies and aggregate policy states with policy initiatives.
  - Handle exclusion scopes.
- Remediate noncompliance:
  - Real-time remediation.
  - Remediation on existing resources.
