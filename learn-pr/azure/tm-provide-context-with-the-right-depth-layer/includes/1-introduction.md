Threat modeling gives engineers the ability to graphically describe their system to others. It creates a common ground and enables more focused security conversations.

## The importance of depth layers

Threat models can either get too complex or too high-level, depending on the system you're building and the required context.

Data-flow diagram depth layers help you understand how much context to include. In this module, you'll learn about data-flow diagram depth layers and when to use them.

> [!TIP]
> Talk to your colleagues and security team to select the right depth layer. You can also use this module as reference.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you'll:

- Learn the differences between the data-flow diagram depth layers.
- Learn when to use each layer.
