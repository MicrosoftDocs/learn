The goal of this module was to help you evaluate whether the Azure Developer CLI (`azd`) can improve the cloud journey for your app. We discussed the following features and benefits provided by `azd`:

- Easy-to-use commands that map to common developer workflow steps.
- A library of reusable, extensible templates that are preconfigured for common scenarios.
- The ability to convert your own projects into new `azd` templates.
- Portable, reusable infrastructure as code scaffolding for the project.
- Compatibility and support for CI/CD pipelines and monitoring.

Consider these factors when deciding if `azd` is a great fit for your project or team. `azd` can provide significant value to most apps that require streamlined provisioning and deployment to Azure in a repeatable, distributable format.
