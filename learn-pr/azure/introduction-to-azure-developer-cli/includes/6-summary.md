The goal of this module was to help you evaluate whether the Azure Developer CLI can improve the cloud journey for your app. We discussed the following features and benefits provided by `azd`:

- Easy-to-use commands that map to common developer workflow steps
- A library of reusable, extensible templates that are pre-configured for common scenarios
- The ability to convert your own projects into new `azd` templates
- Portable, reusable infrastructure as code scaffolding for the project
- Compatibility and support for CI/CD pipelines and monitoring

Consider these factors when deciding if `azd` is a great fit for your project or team. `azd` can provide significant value to most apps that require streamlined provisioning and deployment to Azure in a repeatable, distributable format.
