To protect patients' sensitive health data, you were asked to identify a secure identity solution for your healthcare application.

You learned how you can use Azure Active Directory B2C (Azure AD B2C) to manage patients' access to healthcare applications. You learned how to create a tenant for users and an application, and to register an application with the B2C tenant. To protect how sensitive health data is accessed, you saw how to enable factor authentication in a user flow. By using multifactor authentication, you can add a second layer of protection to the application.

Without Azure AD B2C, it would be harder to manage patients' access to the healthcare application. Your application will provide less protection if you don't use multifactor authentication along with Azure AD B2C. If someone acquired a patient's user name and password, that patient's data would be compromised.

Azure AD B2C can remove the complexity of managing user authentication for your application, saving your organization time and money. By enabling multifactor authentication for the Azure AD B2C application, you can further protect the sensitive data. You'll also protect your company's reputation.
