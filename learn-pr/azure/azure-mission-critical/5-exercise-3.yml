quiz:
  title: Knowledge check
  questions:
  - content: 'What needs to be included in your health score that represents the overall health status of the application?'
    choices:
    - content: 'Logs and metrics from the API code, Azure services, and the end-to-end solution.'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: 'Health of Azure services and platform dependencies that participate in a request flow can have an impact on the application. Compute, databases, storage are some of the key components that must be considered. Solution level data points will help you understand the end-to-end flows, such as end-to-end processing time of a request.'
    - content: 'Logs and metrics from services that are used by Azure services.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'An Azure service will show degraded or unhealthy if any of its underlying services have issues.'
    - content: 'Telemetry data from dashboards that visualize monitoring data.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'Dashboards are used to visualize monitoring data and are decoupled from application components.'
  - content: 'Which of these Azure services can be used as a unified data sink for telemetry and analysis?'
    choices:
    - content: 'Azure Application Insights'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'Azure Application Insights collects logs from the application code. It is not used as a unified data sink.'
    - content: 'Azure Monitor Logs'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: 'Azure Monitor collects data sent by Application insights and platform metrics for the Azure services.'
    - content: 'Azure Storage'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'Azure Storage can be used to offload telemetry for historical analysis, but it is not well-suited as the unified sink for telemetry.'
