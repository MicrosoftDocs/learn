  title: Knowledge check
  questions:
  - content: "Why was caching implemented on the health endpoint?"
    choices:
    - content: "To reduce the cost of the health check."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "While a lower number of dependency calls can result in lower cost, it's not significant enough to be the primary motivation for caching."
    - content: "To increase accuracy of the health check results."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Caching can make health check results less accurate, because it might present an older state. Cache expiration duration must be tuned properly."
    - content: "To prevent overwhelming the downstream components."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Various health probes, such as those on Azure Front Door, can call the health API frequently, and sometimes even in parallel. Caching prevents excessive load on downstream services from those calls."
  - content: "Your API is protected by App Service Authentication. Will App Service Health Check work with the health check API endpoint?"
    choices:
    - content: "No. Both App Service Authentication and Health Check can't be enabled at the same time on the service."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The health check probe request from the platform is done behind the Authentication service. The request accesses your health check endpoint anonymously, bypassing the Authorization service."
    - content: "Yes. The health check is performed without traversing App Service Authentication, reaching your health check API as anonymous traffic. External health monitors would need to generate valid access tokens for their health probes."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "The health check probe request from the platform is done behind the Authentication service and accesses your health check endpoint anonymously, bypassing the Authorization service. Requests originating from outside the service don't bypass the Authorization service and must be able to generate credentials for the request. External monitoring is encouraged, as it can also help in detecting App Service Authentication service faults."
    - content: "Yes. You can configure Azure App Service to acquire the necessary access tokens to send with health probes."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "App Service Health Check only supports calling anonymous endpoints, and doesn't have a way to generate authentication tokens."
