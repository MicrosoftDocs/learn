title: Challenge Project - Design a mission-critical web application
summary: |
  You'll be given the architecture of an example web workload, its current state, tradeoffs, and business requirements for improvements. You want to make it highly available and resilient using the capabilities of Azure. 
  > [!NOTE]
  > This module is a **_Challenge Project_** module where you complete an end-to-end project using high-level guidance; there are no step-by-step instructions for the actual implementation.
abstract: |
  In this module, you'll demonstrate your ability to:
   - Apply mission-critical design principles to an existing architecture to make it fault tolerant 
   - Define key strategies for observing the overall health of the system
prerequisites: |
  - Extensive experience in designing cloud native applications that include core infrastructure technology such as data storage, compute, and networking
  - Good understanding of the design principles and design areas of a mission-critical workload provided in the Azure Well-Architected Framework
