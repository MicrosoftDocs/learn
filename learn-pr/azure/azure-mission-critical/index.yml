summary: |
  You're given an example web workload architecture, its current state, tradeoffs, and business requirements for improvements. You want to make it highly available and resilient using Azure's capabilities. 
  > [!NOTE]
  > This module is a **_Challenge Project_** module, where you complete an end-to-end project using high-level guidance; there are no step-by-step instructions for the actual implementation.
abstract: |
  In this module, you demonstrate your ability to:
   - Apply mission-critical design principles to an existing architecture to make it fault tolerant. 
   - Define key strategies for observing the system's overall health.
prerequisites: |
  - Extensive experience in designing cloud-native applications that include core infrastructure technology such as data storage, compute, and networking
