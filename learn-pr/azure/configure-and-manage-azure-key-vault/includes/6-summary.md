After you have a key vault, you can start using it to store keys and secrets. Your applications no longer need to persist this confidential data, but can request them from the vault as needed. A key vault allows you to update keys and secrets without affecting the behavior of your application, which opens up a breadth of possibilities for your key, secret, and certificate management.

In this module, you've learned about several security benefits of AKV:

- You can create a segmentation of security roles – no one person has the keys to the kingdom.
- The service is monitored and access is logged – giving you the capability to track user activity and prevent, detect, and minimize a security incident.
- You can avoid mistakes – other than the creation of the vault, the services can be automated.
- AKV cloud services are available, accessible, and distributed to ensure high reliability for your services.
