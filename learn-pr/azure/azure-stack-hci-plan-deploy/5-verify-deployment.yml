  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:

  - content: "Which event warrants running the Azure Stack HCI cluster validation?"
    choices:
    - content: "Adding a new server to an existing cluster."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Cluster validation is warranted when adding a new server to an existing cluster."
    - content: "Replacing a failed drive in an existing cluster."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Replacing a failed drive in an existing cluster. Replacement doesn't warrant running the wizard, but adding drives to the nodes of the existing cluster does."
    - content: "Adding a highly available VM to the cluster."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Workload-related changes don't warrant running cluster validation."

  - content: "What tool can test for issues with network connectivity, throughput, and congestion on your network, including with the RDMA protocol?"
    choices:
    - content: "Ping"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The Ping tool determines if a specified host can be reached across an IP network."
    - content: "Test-Cluster"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Test-Cluster runs the cluster validation."
    - content: "Test-NetStack"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Test-NetStack can validate the various network data paths, testing native, synthetic, and hardware offloaded (RDMA) data paths for issues with connectivity, packet fragmentation, low throughput, and congestion."
