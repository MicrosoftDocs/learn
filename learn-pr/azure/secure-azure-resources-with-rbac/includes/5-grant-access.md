A coworker named Alain at First Up Consultants needs permission to create and manage virtual machines for a project on which they're working. Your manager has asked that you handle this request. Using the best practice to grant users the least privileges to get their work done, you decide to assign Alain the Virtual Machine Contributor role for a resource group.

## Grant access

Follow this procedure to assign the Virtual Machine Contributor role to a user at the resource group scope.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com?azure-portal=true) as an administrator that has permissions to assign roles, such as [User Access Administrator](/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#user-access-administrator) or [Owner](/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#owner).

1. In the Search box at the top, search for **Resource groups**.
