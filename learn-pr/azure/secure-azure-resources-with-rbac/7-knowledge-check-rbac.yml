  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "Suppose a team member can't view resources in a resource group. Where would the administrator go to check the team member's access?"
    choices:
    - content: "Check the team member's permissions by going to their **Azure profile > My permissions**."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The Azure profile permissions show permissions at the subscription scope. But an administrator could view the list of assigned roles on the user profile in Active Directory."
    - content: "Go to the resource group and select **Access control (IAM)** > **Check Access**."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Find the list of role of assignments on the resource group."
    - content: "Go to one of the resources in the resource group and select **Role assignments**."
      isCorrect: False
      explanation: "The resource inherits permissions from the resource group so you could see their access to the specific resource. But you should go to the resource group to view and manage permissions at that scope."
  - content: "Suppose an administrator in another department needs access to a virtual machine managed by your department. What's the best way to grant them access to just that resource?"
    choices:
    - content: "At the resource scope, create a role for them with the appropriate access."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "For this scenario, at the resource scope, assign one of the built-in roles like contributor or reader instead of creating a new role."
    - content: "At the resource group scope, assign the role with the appropriate access."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "If you assign a role at the resource group scope, they'll have access to all resources in that resource group."
    - content: "At the resource scope, assign the role with the appropriate access."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "For this scenario, at the virtual machine scope, assign one of the built-in roles that grants the appropriate access for the administrator."      
  - content: "Suppose a developer needs full access to a resource group. If you are following least-privilege best practices, what scope should you specify?"
    choices:
    - content: "Resource"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Following least-privilege best practices, you grant only the access the user needs to do their job. In this case, you should set the scope to the resource group."
    - content: "Resource group"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Following least-privilege best practices, you grant only the access the user needs to do their job. In this case, you should set the scope to the resource group."
    - content: "Subscription"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Following least-privilege best practices, you grant only the access the user needs to do their job. In this case, you should set the scope to the resource group."
  - content: "Suppose an administrator needs to generate a report of the role assignments for the last week. Where in the Azure portal would they generate that report?"
    choices:
    - content: "Search for **Activity log** and filter on the **Create role assignment (roleAssignments)** operation."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "In the Activity log, filter on the **Operation name** field to find role assignments."
    - content: "At the appropriate scope, go to **Access control (IAM)** > **Download role assignments**."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Downloading role assignments gives you a file with a list of the current role assignments."
    - content: "At the appropriate scope, go to **Access control (IAM)** > **Role assignments**."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The **Role assignments** page lists the current role assignments."
