In addition to a public-facing web site, the department uses web sites for in-house content such as dispatch and patient care records. These sites must be as secure as possible.

Here, you learn how to assess agent connectivity, and schedule a recurring update.

## Components used by Update Management

The following configurations are used to perform assessment and update deployments:

- Microsoft Monitoring Agent (MMA) for Windows or Linux
- PowerShell Desired State Configuration (DSC) for Linux
- Automation Hybrid Runbook Worker
- Microsoft Update or Windows Server Update Services (WSUS) for Windows computers

## Compliance scan

Update Management performs a scan for update compliance. By default, a compliance scan is performed every 12 hours on a Windows computer and every 3 hours on a Linux computer. In addition to the scan schedule, a compliance scan is initiated within 15 minutes if the MMA is restarted, before update installation, and after update installation. After a computer performs a scan for update compliance, the agent forwards the information in bulk to Azure Log Analytics.

It can take between 30 minutes and 6 hours for the dashboard to display updated data from managed computers.

## Recurring Updates

You can create a scheduled and recurring deployment of updates. With scheduled deployment, you can define what target computers receive the updates. You can either explicitly specify computers, or select a computer group based on log searches of a specific set of computers. You also specify a schedule to approve and designate a period of time during which updates can be installed.

In Azure Automation, *runbooks* install your updates. You can't view these runbooks, and the runbooks don’t require any configuration. When an update deployment is created, the update deployment creates a schedule that starts a master update runbook at the specified time for the included computers. The master runbook starts a child runbook on each agent to perform installation of the required updates.
