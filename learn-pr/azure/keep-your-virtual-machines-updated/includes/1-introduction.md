Imagine you're the server administrator for a regional fire department (RFD) covering dozens of stations. Your department has recently migrated their on-premises systems to the cloud; specifically, they've migrated existing servers to virtual machines hosted in Azure. The department has public-facing and private websites supporting email, patient records, and internal applications.

As a part of your effort to keep your infrastructure secure, you need to ensure that the virtual machines in your cloud environment are  up-to-date with the latest security and critical updates.
