title: Design an Azure Kubernetes Service network with Azure CNI
summary: In this module, we'll take a detailed look at the process of designing an Azure Kubernetes Service network using the Azure Container Network Interface (CNI) plug-in. We'll cover some Kubernetes networking basics looking at how certain resource types use IP addresses. Then we'll use a fictional application to see how to size a Kubernetes cluster and in turn, determine the requirements for the network. To finish, we'll walk through the process of deploying an Azure Kubernetes Service cluster and will view details of the network configuration.

  - List the key Kubernetes resource types that require network access.
  - Assess an application's needs and how that could affect network design.
  - Understand the steps to size an Azure Kubernetes Service cluster for a workload.
  - Design a network for an Azure Kubernetes Service cluster using Azure CNI
prerequisites: |
  - Understand Docker containers at a beginner level.
  - Understand Kubernetes at a beginner level.
