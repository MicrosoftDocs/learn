    - content: "Groups"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Microsoft Purview doesn't use groups to organize data."
  - content: "At which point does Microsoft Purview begin to populate the data catalog with assets?"
    choices:
    - content: "After a Microsoft Purview account is created"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Data sources need to be registered and scanned before any information is added to the data catalog."
    - content: "After a Data Source has been registered"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "When a data source is registered, that source is added to the data map, but no assets in that source are added until the source has been scanned."
    - content: "After a Data Source has been scanned"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Microsoft Purview captures technical metadata information like names, file size, and schema during scanning, and adds data assets to the catalog once scanning is complete."
  - content: "Which of the following attributes isn't automatically assigned to an asset as a result of the system-built scanning functionality?"
    choices:
    - content: "Technical Metadata (for example, Fully Qualified Name, Path, Schema, etc.)"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Technical metadata is captured as part of the scanning process and is recorded for all assets. The kind of metadata recorded is dependent on the data type."
    - content: "Glossary Terms (for example, column Sales Tax is tagged with the Sales Tax glossary term)"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Business glossary terms define a business vocabulary for an organization to help bridge data gaps between departments. These are created by businesses and associated manually with data assets using tagging after an asset has been added to the catalog."
    - content: "Classifications (for example, column ccnum is tagged with the Credit Card Number classification)"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Classifications and sensitivity labels are automatically applied to data as it is scanned, to organize your data into logical categories, and identify sensitive data in your data assets."
