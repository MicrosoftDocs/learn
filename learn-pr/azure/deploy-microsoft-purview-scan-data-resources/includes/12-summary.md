# Summary

You were requested by Fabrikam to help establish the foundation for effective data usage and unified data governance. Microsoft Purview was selected to support Fabrikam on their journey, providing a holistic, up-to-date map of their data landscape with automated data discovery, sensitive data classification, and end-to-end data lineage.

In this module, you have learned how to deploy, configure, and use Microsoft Purview with an Azure Data Lake Gen2 storage account. You've learned how to register and scan a data source, how to logically group data sources using collections, and how to manage access via role assignments. By using Microsoft Purview as a central catalog, Frabrikam can now get a complete and comprehensive overview of their data estate by expanding the use of Microsoft Purview to other data sources, helping maximize the business value of their data.
