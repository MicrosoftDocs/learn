The Azure Well-Architected Framework is a guide that helps ensure that your workload is: 

- Resilient, available, and recoverable.
- As secure as you need it to be.
- Worth the investment.
- **Developed and operated responsibly.**
- Meeting its goals on time.

The Operational Excellence pillar focuses on using DevOps practices to keep workloads running smoothly. It lays out clear processes for development, monitoring, and release management to help teams stay aligned and follow consistent workflows. The main goal is to reduce variation, avoid human errors, and minimize disruption to customers.

To assess your operational health, start with these questions:

- Are you running your operations in a consistent, reliable way?
- Can customers use the system in a stable and expected way?
- Are you learning from experience and data to keep getting better?

When no one clearly owns or leads workload operations, things can get messy fast. Teams might fall back on high-effort, low-impact methods that don't deliver great results. And that approach usually leads to a poor user experience. These quick fixes might work for now, but real long-term improvements come from regularly reviewing how things are going and making smart, strategic changes.

The concepts described in this module aren't all-inclusive of operational excellence in a workload, but they represent the core principles and some of their key approaches. For a complete overview of the Well-Architected Framework pillars, check out the [Azure Well-Architected Framework](/azure/well-architected) as you start planning and designing your architecture.

Each unit in this module dives into one [design principle](/azure/well-architected/operational-excellence/principles) and three approaches for that principle. You can find examples of the approaches in each unit to see how they can be applied to real-world scenarios. The examples are all based on a fictional company.
