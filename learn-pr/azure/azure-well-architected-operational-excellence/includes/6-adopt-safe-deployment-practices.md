| :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

Set up an automated, modular deployment process so everything rolls out the same way every time. When you apply safe practices early, like in testing, monitoring, and versioning, you build confidence in production and make it easier to recover if something goes wrong.

**Example scenario**

Contoso Air has developed a web application that allows customer to book flights directly. The app has been running in production for over a year. 

The app is fully deployed in Azure and is built on Azure App Service, Azure Cosmos DB, Azure Functions, Azure Logic Apps, and Azure Service Bus. 

## Deploy infrastructure through code

**Use infrastructure as code (IaC) to define the repeatable aspects of the supply chain that are production ready. Prefer declarative approaches over imperative methods.**

Declarative IaC tools are built to make automation and reuse easy. They let you shift infrastructure setup from individuals to tools and pipelines, so actions get done the same way every time, with fewer mistakes.

Fewer technology options also reduce variance in tooling, make it easier to see configuration drift, and simplify maintenance. If you pick tools that match your team's existing skills, it's easier for everyone to get on board.

*Contoso's challenge*

- The Contoso Air workload team uses automated build and deployment pipelines, but they usually have to step in manually during the process to tweak and check different configuration settings.

- Because of all that manual work, deployment errors happen often. Every release is a stressful, disruptive event for the whole team. And when a deployment fails, rolling back isn't easy either.

*Applying the approach and outcomes*

- The team set aside time to automate the configuration changes as part of the deployment and to add the new functionality into the existing deployment pipelines.

- Configuration settings for each environment are now stored in separate JSON files, which are saved in source control so they're easy to track. Any settings that are considered secrets are stored in secret vaults, with one set up for each environment.

- Every change is now logged during deployment, providing full traceability to help with troubleshooting and audits. The team also adds automated tests to the pipeline to check that configuration changes are working as expected.
- Next, the team plans to fully automate rollbacks to make the process even smoother.
- As a result of the new automation, deployments have been more reliable and predictable, and team morale has gone up too.

## Deploy small, incremental updates at a regular cadence

**Divide work into small, manageable updates that can be developed and deployed frequently.**

Smaller updates are easier to test and less risky. If an error occurs, it's easier to find and fix. Releasing several changes at once can cause bigger problems and make it harder to figure out what went wrong.

*Contoso's challenge*

- The team used to do major releases every three to four months, which made it tough to validate everything properly. With so many moving parts, troubleshooting was a real challenge.

- There were several rough releases that needed hot-fixes midstream or had to be rolled back entirely.
- Each release turned into a situation that required everyone's help. They were very stressful and draining for the whole team, which really took a toll on morale.

*Applying the approach and outcomes*

- After the latest problematic release, stakeholders asked the team to rethink how they handle deployments. The team decided to shift gears and go with smaller, more frequent changes. Each release will now focus on just one, or a few closely related, updates that get thoroughly tested as they move through the lower environments.

- This change has made releases more efficient, and quality has increased. It's easier to validate each release, and tracking down problems is a lot simpler.
- A steady rhythm of predictable releases has really helped restore team morale and confidence. Users are seeing the benefits too, with fewer disruptions and quicker access to new features.

## Use a progressive exposure approach

**Roll out updates gradually and with care. Use deployment models that let you slowly ramp up starting with just a few instances or customers, so you can make sure updates work smoothly before going all in.**

Test each update in a controlled way so you can catch and fix problems early in production. This practice help you avoid pushing out a faulty update that could affect all your customers.

Test whether the update is backward and forward compatible to see if it works well with other versions.

*Contoso's challenge*

- The team is seeing some great benefits from switching to smaller releases. They're spending less time managing deployments and feeling motivated to keep pushing for improvements in how they run processes.

- But as they try out new features, not everything has landed well. Some changes have confused users or led to more support calls because of steep learning curves.
- Now they're thinking about how to keep innovating in ways that really boost user productivity, without causing too much disruption when a new feature might not be as popular or easy to use.

*Applying the approach and outcomes*

- The team decided to roll out new features gradually by using feature flags, so users get access to new features incrementally.

- During planning, they define who should see the feature first. Usually a small group of users gets early access. Based on how that group responds, the team expands the rollout to more users until everyone's on the new version. As more people start using the features, the support team tracks what comes up in support cases and shares those insights internally, and possibly in the external FAQ too.
