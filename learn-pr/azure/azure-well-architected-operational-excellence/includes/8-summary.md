In this module, you learned about the six key principles of the Operational Excellence pillar in the Azure Well-Architected Framework.

The operational side of a workload matters just as much as the business side. When your processes run smoothly, it's easier to achieve your business goals while staying compliant, whether that's with internal policies or outside regulations. The real trick is making sure processes are consistent and repeatable every time.

**The goals of the Operational Excellence pillar are to do the right thing, to do it the right way, and to solve the right problems as a team.**

If you meet these goals, your workloads will keep running smoothly and predictably even when changes happen. But if you miss the mark on operational requirements, you could end up with failed deployments, a clunky user experience, and extra costs that could have been avoided with better planning and smoother implementation.
