In this module, you've looked at the six key principles of the Operational Excellence pillar of the Azure Well-Architected Framework.

The operational requirements of a workload are as important as its business requirements. Efficient processes ensure the workload achieves business outcomes within the constraints of compliance, whether that compliance is organizational or external. The key is to find repeatability with consistency.

**The goals of the Operational Excellence pillar are to do the right thing, to do it the right way, and to solve the right problems as a team.**

If you meet these goals, workloads will run reliably and predictably even during times of change. Inability to fulfill operational requirements can lead to failed deployments, inconsistent user experience, and added costs that could have been avoided through proper planning and streamlined execution.
