    choices:
    - content: 'Performing all QA testing at the end of the development cycle'
      isCorrect: false

    - content: 'They took an internal survey to see how their developers felt about the changes.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While internal surveys can be useful, they don't provide a good measure of development velocity."
