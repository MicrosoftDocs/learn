  questions:

  - content: "Which industry-standard tool can you use to maintain a backlog?"
    choices:
    - content: "Excel"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Excel isn't a good tool for maintaining a backlog."
    - content: "Azure Boards"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Azure Boards is an industry-standard tool for maintaining a backlog."
    - content: "Azure Pipelines"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Azure Pipelines is a tool for managing a CI/CD pipeline, not for maintaining a backlog."
    - content: "Azure SQL Database"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Azure SQL Database is a relational database service, not a tool for maintaining a backlog."
  - content: "Which strategy can help you improve your development velocity and efficiency?"
    choices:
    - content: "Performing all QA testing at the end of the development cycle"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Performing all QA testing at the end of the development cycle can lead to a large number of bugs that are expensive to fix."
    - content: "Relying on customer reports to identify bugs"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Relying on customer reports to identify bugs can lead to a poor customer experience and a loss of customer confidence."
    - content: "Deploying large and infrequent changes"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Deploying large and infrequent changes is an inefficient approach. Deploying frequent, small changes is a more efficient approach."
    - content: "Testing early and often in the development cycle"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Testing early and often helps development efficiency by catching bugs early and reducing the cost of fixing them."
  - content: "How did Contoso determine which recent process changes had the greatest impact on improving quality and efficiency?"
    choices:
    - content: "They used the reporting features in Azure DevOps to help track improvements over time."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Azure DevOps provides reporting features that can help you measure your velocity and identify areas for improvement."
    - content: "They timed how long it took to complete each step in their development process."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This is an inefficient approach to measuring velocity."
    - content: "They asked their customers to rate their satisfaction with the product."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While customer satisfaction is important, it doesn't provide a good measure of development velocity."
    - content: "They took an internal survey to see how their developers felt about the changes."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While internal surveys can be useful, they don't provide a good measure of development velocity."
