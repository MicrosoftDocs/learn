  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: 'Which of the following is a fundamental principle of safe deployment practices?'
    choices:
    - content: 'All deployments should be automated through pipelines.'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. All deployments should be automated through pipelines. This ensures that deployments are consistent and repeatable."
    - content: 'All deployments should be performed manually.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'Incorrect. Manual deployments are error-prone and inconsistent.'
    - content: 'Only deployments to production should be automated.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. All deployments should be automated, not just those to production. This ensures that deployments are consistent and repeatable."
    - content: 'Only deployments to non-production environments should be automated.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. All deployments should be automated, not just those to non-production environments. This ensures that deployments are consistent and repeatable."
  - content: 'Which of the following is a recommended deployment strategy?'
    choices:
    - content: 'Prefer large, infrequent deployments.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'Incorrect. Large, infrequent deployments are risky and difficult to roll back.'
    - content: 'Prefer small, frequent deployments.'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: 'Correct. Small, frequent deployments are less risky and easier to roll back.'
    - content: 'Prefer large, frequent deployments.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Deploying frequently is good, but large deployments are risky and difficult to roll back."
    - content: 'Prefer small, infrequent deployments.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Small deployments are good, but they should be frequent. This ensures that deployments are consistent and repeatable."
  - content: 'How did Contoso adopt the approach of progressive exposure?'
    choices:
    - content: 'They created separate environments for each feature, and exposed the environments to users as they were ready.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'Incorrect. This approach would require a large number of environments, and would be difficult to manage.'
    - content: 'They had users enroll in a test program, and exposed new features to the users in the program.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'Incorrect. This approach would be difficult to manage.'
    - content: 'They used a blue-green deployment strategy to push a new version to a portion of the production environment, and then gradually increased the exposure of the new version.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. In this case the team chose to use feature flags."
    - content: 'They used feature flags to control the exposure of new features to users.'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. This allowed Contoso to gradually expose new features to users, and to roll back the features if necessary."
