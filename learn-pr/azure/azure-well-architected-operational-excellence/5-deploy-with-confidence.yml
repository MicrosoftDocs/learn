  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "How can deploying IaC help you deploy with confidence?"
    choices:
    - content: "IaC doesn't have to be patched."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. IaC is still subject to the same patching requirements as any other infrastructure."
    - content: "IaC can be consistently and repeatedly deployed."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Deploying IaC allows you to consistently and repeatedly deploy your workload, cutting down the risk of human error."
    - content: "IaC is less prone to security vulnerabilities."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. IaC is still vulnerable to the same security vulnerabilities as any other infrastructure."
    - content: "IaC relieves compliance requirements."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. IaC is still subject to the same compliance requirements as any other infrastructure."
  - content: "How did moving the IaC code to the same repository as the application code help the Contoso team deploy with confidence?"
    choices:
    - content: "It allowed them to bypass their QA testing processes for the IaC code."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The Contoso team still had to test the IaC code, but they were able to do so in the same repository as the application code."
    - content: "It allowed them to remove large portions of their IaC code because of overlap with the application code."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Moving the IaC code to the same repository as the application code didn't affect the amount of code that needed to be maintained."
    - content: "It allowed them to skip version control for the IaC code."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Version control is still essential even when IaC is stored in the same repository as application code."
    - content: "It allowed them to apply the same governance and security standards across both codebases."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. By moving the IaC code to the same repository as the application code, the Contoso team cut down the risk of security or governance problems by applying the same standards across both codebases."
  - content: "What can you use to help ensure a smooth and efficient deployment of a disaster recovery (DR) environment?"
    choices:
    - content: "A common deployment manifest"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Using a common deployment manifest across your workload environments ensures that your DR environment mirrors your primary environment and can be deployed quickly."
    - content: "A manual deployment process"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A manual deployment process is prone to human error and can be time consuming."
    - content: "A different deployment manifest for each environment"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Using a different deployment manifest for each environment can lead to inconsistencies between environments, which can cause problems when deploying your DR environment."
    - content: "Maintaining a separate repository for your DR environment"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Maintaining a separate repository for your DR environment can lead to inconsistencies between environments, which can cause problems when deploying your DR environment."
