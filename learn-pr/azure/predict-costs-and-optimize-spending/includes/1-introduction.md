When planning a solution in the cloud, there's always the challenge of balancing cost against performance. It can feel like a guessing game whether your selected options will stay within budget or if you'll have a surprise on your next bill.

You need to be able to confidently answer several questions:

- What will this solution cost this fiscal year?
- Is there an alternate configuration you could use to save money?
- Can you estimate how a change would impact your cost and performance _without_ putting it into a production system?

In this module, we'll explore the tools you can use to answer these questions and more.
