We've talked through the Azure pricing calculator and how you can use it to estimate your costs on Azure and compare pricing between different service offerings. We looked at savings options, how to export pricing estimates, and at various tools that Azure has available to help you keep your cloud spend in check.

- Azure Advisor provides recommendations in many areas, including cost.
- Azure Cost Management gives you reporting and billing information, so you can gain insights into where you're spending your money.
- Cloudyn takes this even further and gives you detailed information that you can use for chargebacks and to identify areas of inefficiency.

We then explored best practices to help you save money on both infrastructure and licensing.
