    title: Check your knowledge
    questions:

    - content: "Which one of these approaches is *not* a cost-saving solution?"
      choices:
      - content: "Deallocate virtual machines during off hours."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Deallocating virtual machines will reduce the amount of usage billed to your account and save costs."
      - content: "Use Azure Reserved Virtual Machine Instances."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "This approach is less expensive than pay-as-you-go when you have consistent workloads for your VMs and can commit to a longer-term service agreement."
      - content: "Load balance your virtual machines for incoming messages."
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "Load balancing is used for performance optimization not cost savings."
      - content: "Right-size underutilized virtual machines."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Scaling down a VM will reduce its cost."

    - content: "True or false: PaaS is typically less expensive than IaaS."
      choices:
      - content: "True"
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "IaaS requires Azure to dedicate resources while PaaS give Azure more flexibility in how services are delivered. This approach means Azure can fill and operate hardware efficiently and therefore offer PaaS services at a savings over IaaS."
      - content: "False"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Generally, contracting for a PaaS service is less expensive than IaaS resources."
