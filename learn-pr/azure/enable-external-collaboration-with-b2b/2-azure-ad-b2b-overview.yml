  questions:
  - content: What is one of the main advantages of using Azure AD B2B collaboration?
    choices:
    - content: You can allow people outside of your organization to use their own credentials to sign in to your apps.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. A B2B collaboration user authenticates using credentials from their home organization or identity provider, so you don't need to provide or maintain credentials for them.
    - content: You can collaborate with people outside of your organization by giving them a user ID and password.

      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Try again. A user object for the B2B collaboration user is added to your directory, and you can manage it like other user objects in your directory. For example you can assign it permissions, add it to groups, and so on.

    choices:
    - content: Use unconditional access policies in Azure AD B2B.

    - content: Use Conditional Access policies in Azure AD B2B.

    - content: Use criteria access policies in Azure AD B2B.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Try again. There's no such thing as criteria access policies in Azure.
