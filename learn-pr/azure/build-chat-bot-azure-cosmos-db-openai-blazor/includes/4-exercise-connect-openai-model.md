The `OpenAiService` class contains a stub implementation of a service that can send prompts to an AI assistant and parse the responses.

There are a few key requirements to tackle in this exercise:

- Import the .NET SDK for Azure OpenAI
- Add the Azure OpenAI endpoint and key to the application settings
- Modify the service class with various members and a client instance

## Import the .NET SDK

The [`Azure.AI.OpenAI`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Azure.AI.OpenAI) package on NuGet provides a typed SDK to access various model deployments from your account endpoint.

1. Open a new terminal.

1. Use [`dotnet add package`](/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-add-package) to import the `Azure.AI.OpenAI` package from NuGet specifying a prerelease version of `1.0.0-beta.14`.

    ```bash
    dotnet add package Azure.AI.OpenAI --version 1.0.0-beta.14
    ```

1. Build the .NET project again.

    ```bash
    dotnet build
    ```

1. Close the terminal.

## Add application settings

In a .NET application, it's common to use the configuration providers to inject new settings into your application. For this application, use the `appsettings.Development.json` file to provide the most current values for the Azure OpenAI endpoint and key.

1. In the root of the project, create a new file named **appsettings.Development.json**.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > On Linux, files are case-sensitive. The .NET environment for this project is named **Development** and the filename must match that environment name to work.

1. Within the file, create a new JSON object with a placeholder property for `OpenAi` settings.

    ```json
    {
      "OpenAi": {            
      }
    }
    ```

1. Within the `OpenAi` property, create two new properties for the `Endpoint` and `Key`. Use the Azure OpenAI endpoint and key settings you recorded earlier in this project.

    ```json
    {
      "OpenAi": {
        "Endpoint": "<your-azure-openai-endpoint>",
        "Key": "<your-azure-openai-key>"
      }
    }
    ```

    Assuming the name of the Azure OpenAI account is **nybncrsna76fo-openai** and the key is `4bf98cb194cdf0f9001eae3259a76ed8`, you would configure the JSON object like this example.

    ```json
    {
      "OpenAi": {
        "Endpoint": "https://nybncrsna76fo-openai.openai.azure.com/",
        "Key": "4bf98cb194cdf0f9001eae3259a76ed8"
      }
    }
    ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > The key in this example is fictitious.

1. Save the **appsettings.Development.json** file.

## Add required members and a client instance

Finally, implement the class variables required to use the Azure OpenAI client. At this step, implement a few static prompts and create a new instance of the `OpenAIClient` class.

1. Open the **Services/OpenAiService.cs** file.

1. Add using directives for the `Azure` and `Azure.AI.OpenAI` namespaces.

    ```csharp
    using Azure;
    using Azure.AI.OpenAI;
    ```

1. Within the `OpenAiService` class, add a new variable named `_client` that's of type [`OpenAIClient`](/dotnet/api/azure.ai.openai.openaiclient).

    ```csharp
    private readonly OpenAIClient _client;
    ```

1. Define a static block of text to send to the AI assistant before each prompt with a new string variable named `_systemPromptText`.

    ```csharp
    private readonly string _systemPrompt = @"
        You are an AI assistant that helps people find information.
        Provide concise answers that are polite and professional." + Environment.NewLine;
    ```

1. Define a second static block of text to send to the AI with instructions on how to summarize a conversation with a new string variable named `_summarizePrompt`.

    ```csharp
    private readonly string _summarizePrompt = @"
        Summarize this prompt in one or two words to use as a label in a button on a web page.
        Do not use any punctuation." + Environment.NewLine;
    ```

1. Within the constructor of the class, add two extra lines of code to check if the endpoint or key is null. Use `ArgumentNullException.ThrowIfNullOrEmpty` to throw an error early if either of these values are null.

    ```csharp
    ArgumentNullException.ThrowIfNullOrEmpty(endpoint);
    ArgumentNullException.ThrowIfNullOrEmpty(key);
    ```

    > [!TIP]
    > When you run the application, this will throw an error right away if either of these settings don't have a valid value provided through the **appsettings.Development.json** file.

1. Next, take the model name that is a parameter of the constructor and save it to the `_modelName` variable.

    ```csharp
    _modelName = modelName;
    ```

1. Finally, create a new instance of the `OpenAIClient` class using the endpoint to build a `Uri` and the key to build an `AzureKeyCredential`.

    ```csharp
    Uri uri = new(endpoint);
    AzureKeyCredential credential = new(key);
    _client = new(
        endpoint: uri,
        keyCredential: credential
    );
    ```

1. Save the **Services/OpenAiService.cs** file.

## Check your work

At this point, your constructor should include enough logic to create a client instance. Since the class doesn't do anything with the client yet, there's no point in running the web application, but there's value in building the application to make sure your code doesn't have any omissions or errors.

### [Validate application](#tab/validate-app)

1. Open a new terminal.

1. Build the .NET project.

    ```bash
    dotnet build
    ```

1. Observe the build output and check to make sure there aren't any build errors.

    ```output
    MSBuild version 17.5.1+f6fdcf537 for .NET
      Determining projects to restore...
      All projects are up-to-date for restore.
      cosmoschatgpt -> /workspaces/cosmosdb-chatgpt/bin/Debug/net8.0/cosmoschatgpt.dll
    
    Build succeeded.
        0 Warning(s)
        0 Error(s)
    
    Time Elapsed 00:00:02.93
    ```

1. Close the terminal.

### [Review code](#tab/review-code)

1. Review the *OpenAiService.cs* code file to make sure that your code matches this sample.

    ```csharp
    using Cosmos.Chat.GPT.Models;
    using Azure;
    using Azure.AI.OpenAI;
    
    namespace Cosmos.Chat.GPT.Services;
    
    public class OpenAiService
    {
        private readonly string _modelName = String.Empty;
        
        private readonly OpenAIClient _client;
        
        private readonly string _systemPrompt = @"
            You are an AI assistant that helps people find information.
            Provide concise answers that are polite and professional." + Environment.NewLine;
        private readonly string _summarizePrompt = @"
            Summarize this prompt in one or two words to use as a label in a button on a web page.
            Do not use any punctuation." + Environment.NewLine;

        public OpenAiService(string endpoint, string key, string modelName)
        {
            // Implementation removed for brevity
        }

        // Other methods removed for brevity
    }
    ```

1. Within the **OpenAiService** class, review the constructor to make sure that your code matches this sample.

    ```csharp
    ArgumentNullException.ThrowIfNullOrEmpty(modelName);

    ArgumentNullException.ThrowIfNullOrEmpty(endpoint);
    ArgumentNullException.ThrowIfNullOrEmpty(key);
    
    _modelName = modelName;

    Uri uri = new(endpoint);
    AzureKeyCredential credential = new(key);
    _client = new(
        endpoint: uri,
        keyCredential: credential
    );
    ```

1. Review the **appsettings.Development.json** file to ensure you have valid credentials for the Azure OpenAI service.

    ```json
    {
      "OpenAi": {
        "Endpoint": "<your-azure-openai-endpoint>",
        "Key": "<your-azure-openai-key>"
      }
    }
    ```
