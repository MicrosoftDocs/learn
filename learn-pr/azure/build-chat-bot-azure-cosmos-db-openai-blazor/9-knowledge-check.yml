  questions:
  - content: |
      Which NuGet package is used to interact with data in Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL from a .NET application?
    choices:
    - content: |
        Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.CosmosDB
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: |
        This extension is used with Azure Functions to support Azure Cosmos DB bindings.
    - content: |
        Microsoft.Azure.Cosmos
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: |
        This library is the official SDK to manage data in an Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL account.
    - content: |
        Azure.ResourceManager.CosmosDB
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: |
        This library is used to manage Azure Cosmos DB resources, but not data.
  - content: |
      After importing the `Azure.AI.OpenAI` library and namespace, which class is used to connect to an Azure OpenAI endpoint and model deployment?
    choices:
    - content: |
        `OpenAiClient`
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: |
        The `OpenAiClient` class is a client class to connect to Azure OpenAI and make data-plane requests.
    - content: |
        `Completions`
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: |
        The `Completions` class contains responses (choices) and utilization metadata about a request.
    - content: |
        `ChatMessage`
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: |
        The `ChatMessage` class contains metadata about the role and content sent to a model for a completion response.

      Which property is required to be the same of all items in a transactional batch within Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL?
    choices:
    - content: |
        eTag
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: |
        The `_etag` for each item is typically distinct and changes anytime the item is changed. This property is typically used to implement optimistic concurrency.
    - content: |
        Unique identifier (&#105;&#100;)
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: |
        The **&#105;&#100;** for each item is distinct within the context of the logical partition. You shouldn't expect this property to be the same within a transactional batch.
    - content: |
        Partition key
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: |
        The partition key value of each item must match exactly within a transactional batch. If an item in the batch has a different partition key value, the transactional batch fails.
