You set out to resolve existing scalability, performance, and availability issues in your food delivery application, make database management easier, and reduce the burden on your developers. You wanted to revamp your application architecture, understand how to deploy your application on Azure, and use the fully managed Azure Database for MySQL - Flexible Server service in the backend.

You identified the best hosting option for your application, updated your application code to connect to and query data from an Azure Database for MySQL flexible server, and learned to deploy your application on Azure App Service. You discovered the best practices to apply to help ensure lower latency, and better security and performance.

If you hadn't modernized the application to use a managed database on Azure, the food delivery platform would have further degraded in performance, leading to  dissatisfied customers, a high customer churn rate, and loss of revenue. You'd also still need to spend your time and effort trying to fix existing issues, along with funding for new hardware that could scale applications during peak loads. In addition, your developers would be overwhelmed with tasks.

Migrating and modernizing your application on Azure with Azure Database for MySQL - Flexible Server helps you build a more robust and performant platform, increasing your usage, adoption rate, and customer satisfaction. You can now focus on application innovation and strategies to expand your business.
