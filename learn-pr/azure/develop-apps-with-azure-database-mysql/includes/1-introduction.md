Azure Database for MySQL - Flexible Server is a fully managed MySQL database as a service offering on Azure, that can handle mission-critical workloads with resiliency, predictable performance and dynamic scalability. It's a developer-friendly service that helps enhance productivity by reducing the overhead associated with managing a server running MySQL, while still providing control and customization options to fine-tune the server for performance. The service is leveraged for several popular use cases, including internet-scale web and mobile apps, e-commerce apps, and gaming.
Azure Database for MySQL - Flexible Server provides you with the flexibility to develop applications using your favorite tools, languages, and frameworks. You can also deploy faster by integrating with Azure services like App Services or Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), and automate CI/CD tasks using GitHub or Azure DevOps.

## Example scenario

Suppose you work at a food delivery company and your team is responsible for managing a web-based platform that allows customers to view restaurant options, order food online, and select food delivery options.

Since your app and MySQL databases are hosted on-premises, developers on your team spend considerable time with server management tasks, governing security, and troubleshooting issues with the operating systems and databases. Recently, you have also noticed multiple performance issues and failures because your app cannot handle the sudden bursts of user requests that occur during peak hours and weekends.

After researching, you determine that moving to a cloud-based managed solution such as Azure Database for MySQL - Flexible Server would be a good option. The move would help to resolve performance and availability issues, make database management easier, and reduce the burden on your developers. At the same time, you want to improve your app performance by migrating to and modernizing your app architecture on Azure.

## What you will do

You'll learn how to develop and deploy apps on Azure that are integrated with Azure Database for MySQL - Flexible Server on the backend. To do this, you'll:

- Query Azure Database for MySQL flexible server from your application.
- Evaluate and select the best application hosting options on Azure.
- Develop and deploy your application on Azure App Service, tapping into the power of the rich ecosystem of Azure services.
- Learn best practices for developing applications with Azure Database for MySQL - Flexible Server.

## What is the main goal?

By the end of this module, you should be able to build and deploy applications using the fully managed service Azure Database for MySQL - Flexible Server and integrate with other Azure services.
