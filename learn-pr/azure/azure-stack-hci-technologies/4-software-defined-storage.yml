  questions:

  - content: "Which software-defined storage feature implements virtualized, highly available clustered storage by using local disks on each node of a Windows Server 2019 failover cluster?"
    choices:
    - content: "Storage Spaces Direct"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Storage Spaces Direct leverages Storage Spaces, failover clustering, CSVs, and SMB 3.x to implement virtualized, highly available clustered storage by using local disks on each node of a Windows Server 2019 failover cluster."
    - content: "SMB Direct"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. SMB Direct optimizes the use of RDMA network adapters for SMB traffic, which allows them to function at full speed with very low latency and low CPU utilization."
    - content: "Storage Replica "
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Storage Replica enables storage-agnostic, block-level, synchronous and asynchronous replication between servers or clusters across different physical locations."

  - content: "What is the minimum number of Windows Server failover clusters that the disaggregated deployment model of Storage Spaces Direct requires?"
    choices:
    - content: "1"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The cluster hosting Hyper-V VMs must be separate from the cluster hosting storage."
    - content: "2"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. In the disaggregated model, the Hyper-V hosts (compute) are in a separate cluster from the Storage Spaces Direct hosts (storage)."
    - content: "3"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. You need at the minimum two clusters."
