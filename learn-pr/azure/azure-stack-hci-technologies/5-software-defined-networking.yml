  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:

  - content: "Which component is necessary to implement Windows Server 2019-based SDN?"
    choices:
    - content: "Network Controller"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Network Controller is a Windows Server role that serves as the centralized and programmable point of automation for the virtual and physical network infrastructure in SDN."
    - content: "RDMA"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. RDMA is a recommended component of Windows Server 2019-based SDN, but it is not required."
    - content: "Datacenter Firewall"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Datacenter Firewall is the functionality you can implement as part of an SDN deployment. It's not a prerequisite."

  - content: "Which Windows Sever component aggregates network throughput available for virtualized workloads by combining multiple network adapters?"
    choices:
    - content: "VxLAN"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. VxLAN is an SDN encapsulation protocol."
    - content: "NVGRE"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. NVGRE is an SDN encapsulation protocol."
    - content: "SET"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. SET enables you to combine up to eight identical physical network adapters directly into the Hyper-V virtual switch. This provides load balancing and bandwidth aggregation functionality, resulting in higher network throughput for virtualized workloads."
