  questions:

  - content: "What is the maximum number of nodes supported by Azure Stack HCI?"
    choices:
    - content: "4"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Azure Stack HCI can consist of up to 16 nodes."
    - content: "16"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Azure Stack HCI can consist of up to 16 nodes."
    - content: "64"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Azure Stack HCI can consist of up to 16 nodes. 64 is the limit of a traditional Windows Server Failover Cluster."

  - content: "Which quorum witness can an administrator implement by using the USB drive in Azure Stack HCI failover clustering?"
    choices:
    - content: "Disk Witness"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Disk Witness uses a clustered disk resource in the same failover cluster."
    - content: "Cloud Witness"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Cloud Witness uses a blob in an Azure Storage account."
    - content: "File Share Witness"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. File Share Witness uses an external file share. Starting with Windows Server 2019, it is possible to implement it by using a USB drive attached to a network device accessible to all cluster nodes."
