Your company plans to deploy IoT devices in vehicles to enable remote monitoring and control using IoT Central. You were asked to integrate device management and control functions into the existing fleet management application so that fleet managers can continue to use a single application.

The IoT Central REST API lets you manage your IoT Central application and devices programmatically. You created API tokens to authorize access to your application for different roles, and used the REST API to manage device templates and devices. You used the REST API to control the devices in your vehicles by setting properties and sending commands. You also programmatically created and ran jobs to do bulk updates on your devices.

Integrating the IoT Central application functionality into your existing fleet management application makes it much easier for operators and fleet managers to analyze and respond to data from your vehicles because they have everything they need in a single application.
