In this exercise, you create an Azure App Service web app with Application Insights enabled, configure autoinstrumentation without modifying code, create and deploy a Blazor application, and then view application metrics and error data in Application Insights. Implementing comprehensive application monitoring and observability, without having to make changes to your code, makes deployments and migrations simpler.

Tasks performed in this exercise:

* Create a web app resource with Application Insights enabled
* Configure instrumentation for the web app.
* Create a new Blazor app and deploy it to the web app resource.
* View application activity in Application Insights
* Clean up resources
