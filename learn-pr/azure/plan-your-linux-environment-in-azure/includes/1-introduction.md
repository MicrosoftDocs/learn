Suppose you work as an information technology (IT) system engineer for a financial services company. The company intends to transition its existing on-premises Linux-based workloads to Azure Linux virtual machines (VMs), which requires consolidating and upgrading some of these systems.

Azure offers several options for deploying Linux-based Azure VMs. The company asks you to design a set of guidelines that will help:

- Ensure that the target environment is properly sized and secure.
- Maintain the same support, performance, and functionality as the on-premises environment.

To optimize the VMs' performance, functionality, and pricing, you must properly plan their configuration and deployment. This learning module reviews how to plan for a deployment of Azure VMs that run Linux operating system (OS). The deployment planning process involves:

- Choosing the VM sizes most suitable for their intended workloads.
- Identifying corresponding networking dependencies.
- Defining storage options.
- Implementing optimization techniques that help maximize deployment benefits.

After you complete this module, you can plan for and recommend compute, networking, and storage options for deploying Azure Linux VMs. You also gain a good understanding of overall Azure platform capabilities that help you optimize your Azure Linux VM environments.
