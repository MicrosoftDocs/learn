This module reviewed the process of planning a deployment of Azure Linux VMs.

- You chose the VM sizes most suitable for their intended workloads, and identified the corresponding networking dependencies.
- You learned how to manage and troubleshoot your VMs by using boot diagnostics and serial console.
- You reviewed storage options and performance optimization techniques that help maximize the benefits of the planned deployment.

With the knowledge you've gained, you can recommend the compute, networking, and storage options most suitable for hosting your company's Linux-based workloads on Azure VMs.
