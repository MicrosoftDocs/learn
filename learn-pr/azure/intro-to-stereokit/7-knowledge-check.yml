  questions:
    - content: "What is StereoKit?"
      choices:
        - content: "StereoKit positively needs a game engine to deliver quality Mixed Reality applications on target devices."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: You don't need a game engine to make an app, and certainly don't need to be a graphics programmer to get your models onto a headset.
        - content: "StereoKit holds a series of functions and features to promote mobile application development."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: StereoKit prioritizes the development of Mixed Reality apps on mobile and immersive devices.
        - content: "It's an open-source Mixed Reality framework used to develop HoloLens and VR apps with C# and OpenXR"
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: It is an open-source Mixed Reality framework used to develop HoloLens and VR apps with C# and OpenXR. It comes with a first-class Mixed Reality input system, excellent performance even on mobile devices. It also supports fast on-device iteration time and a runtime asset pipeline allowing users and developers to load actual files from the file system.
    - content: "Which of the following isn't a feature of StereoKit?"
      choices:
        - content: "Assets are loaded at compilation time."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: Assets are loaded at Runtime not at compilation.
        - content: "StereoKit by default uses a flexible shader or material system with built-in PBR."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: StereoKit by default supports flexible shader or material system with built-in PBR.
        - content: "StereoKit allows computation to proceed faster."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Because StereoKit enables computation to be performed more quickly.
    - content: "What makes StereoKit's UI different from other UI Systems?"
      choices:
        - content: The API used is really complicated.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: The API is really simple, and StereoKit doesn't store the state of the UI itself.
        - content:  StereoKit doesn't allows you to add, remove, or rearrange your UI from one frame to the next. 
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: You can add, remove, or completely rearrange your UI from one frame to the next using standard code structures.
        - content: StereoKit doesn't store the state of the UI itself
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: StereoKit uses an Immediate Mode UI paradigm. You can change or check the state of the UI quite trivially.
    - content: "Which of the following feature is an example of a stepper object?"
      choices:
        - content: Sliders
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: A slider will slide between two values at increments. The function requires a reference to a float variable where the slider's state is stored. 
        - content: Color swatches
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Displays a list of pre-picked color swatches. These color swatches are custom buttons.
        - content: Radial hand menu
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: The HandMenuRadial is an example of a stepper object. Steppers are classes that implement the IStepper interface, and once added to StereoKit's stepper list, they'll have their Step method called each frame.
