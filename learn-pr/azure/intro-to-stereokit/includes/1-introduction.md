StereoKit is an easy-to-use open-source mixed reality engine for building AR and VR applications using C# and OpenXR. Inspired by libraries like XNA and Processing, StereoKit is meant to be fun to use and easy to develop with, yet still quite capable of creating professional and business-ready software.

StereoKit prioritizes mixed reality application development above all else. This allows the library to focus on features such as a first-class mixed reality input system, fast performance by default even on mobile headsets, quick iteration time on-device, and a runtime asset pipeline that lets users and developers load real assets from the file system. All of this and more are packaged in a terse API that's well documented, easy to learn, and easy to write.

Since StereoKit is a real C# library, it also benefits from the ecosystem that existing C# developers know and love. You can use the latest C# features, work directly with Visual Studio, and hook into the wealth of tools and libraries available on NuGet. Since StereoKit is a lightweight dependency with a permissive MIT license, it also makes for a great middle layer to build atop.

For native developers, StereoKit even provides a C API. This can streamline the development of applications that rely heavily on native dependencies.

In this module, you'll get an introduction to StereoKit's features and learn how easy they're to use. We'll also look at the sample project, StereoKit Ink, as an example to illustrate many of these features.
