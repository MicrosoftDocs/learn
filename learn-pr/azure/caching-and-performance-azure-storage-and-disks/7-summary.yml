  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:

  - content: "Which caching option is a good choice for write-heavy operations such as storing log files?"
    choices: 
    - content: Read-only
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Read-only caching works well for data disks, including TempDB data. However, it doesn't improve performance of write-heavy operations and might even cause a slight decrease in performance."
    - content: Read/write
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This option is good if your app properly handles writing cached data to persistent disks when needed."
    - content: None
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Write-heavy operations generally don't benefit from caching. 'None' is probably the best choice for a disk dedicated to log files."

  - content: "For which type of disk does Azure restart the VM in order to change caching type?"
    choices: 
    - content: Data 
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Changing the cache setting of a data disk detaches and reattaches the target disk but doesn't restart the VM."
    - content: Operating system (OS)
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Changing the cache setting of the OS disk requires a VM restart."
    - content: Temporary
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "You can't change caching options on a temporary disk."
    - content: Zone-redundant storage (ZRS)
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "A premium storage account doesn't support ZRS."
  
  - content: "Suppose you're using Azure PowerShell to manage a VM. You have a local object that represents the VM and you make several updates to that local object. Which PowerShell cmdlet would you use to apply those local changes to the actual VM?"
    choices: 
    - content: Update-AzVM
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "This cmdlet updates the state of an Azure virtual machine to the state of a virtual machine object."
    - content: Set-AzVM
      isCorrect: false
    - content: New-AzVM
      isCorrect: false
