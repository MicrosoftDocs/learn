    choices:
    - content: CSV data, with the extracted information separated by commas.

    - content: JSON formatting
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. As programming languages can readily use JSON formatting, Azure AI Document Intelligence returns the extracted information in standard JSON formatting so the data is easier to work with.
  - content: What is a benefit of creating a custom model?
    choices:
    - content: Custom models can be tuned to your specific form and data needs, allowing more accurate analysis and extraction of data.
      isCorrect: true

      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. Both custom models and prebuilt models use OCR.
    - content: Custom models can be tuned to specific types of forms, but prebuilt models are generic models, not tuned to a specific type of form.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. Prebuilt models can be used for invoices, receipts, IDs, and business cards.
