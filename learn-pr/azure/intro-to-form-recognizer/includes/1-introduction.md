Azure AI Document Intelligence is a cognitive service that uses machine learning to automatically read information from images and PDFs. Document Intelligence identifies and extracts data from your documents, and organizes the information for you.

Document Intelligence can be integrated into applications, with SDKs available in many languages, shells, and via REST. Document Intelligence allows you to enhance existing workflows with unstructured data from paper-based or digital documents. Previously, this functionality would have required manual extraction or custom machine learning systems.

With Document Intelligence, you quickly get accurate results that are tailored to your documents, without heavy manual intervention or the requirement for extensive data science expertise. Because Document Intelligence can be tailored to specific content using custom forms, or by inputting data using built-in templates, it allows for secure and more error-free data extraction. Further, Document Intelligence can help organizations process huge amounts of data that otherwise would require a substantial amount of resources to deal with. This service can even help small organizations streamline invoice and receipt data into easily understandable, processable information.
