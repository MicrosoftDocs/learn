There are many scenarios where form analysis might be required. Here are a few that offer insight into some of the many applications of Azure AI Document Intelligence. After going through them, you may come up with other ideas on how to integrate Document Intelligence into your applications.

## Bulk data extraction

Organizations often receive various types of forms, which can be difficult to extract data from without painful manual data entry. Document Intelligence allows organizations to extract the data digitally and combine it with existing operational systems and data storage services. This bulk data extraction, allows them to get insights and deliver value to their customers and business users.

For example, insurance providers are utilizing Document Intelligence's custom model function to extract key data without the need for heavy manual intervention, resulting in claims being processed quicker. The ability to integrate into existing systems and add functionality can be vital during disruptive events. For example, an event such as a pandemic, can result in more claims being lodged and having fewer people available to manually go through the forms.

## Integration with Azure Cognitive Search

Many organizations sit on troves of historical data, and Azure Cognitive Search provides a sophisticated, effective way to search for that data. By integrating Document Intelligence with Azure Cognitive Search, it's possible to combine the capabilities of both services - automatically searching, retrieving, and analyzing information that would normally stay hidden within files not easily searched, such as photographs of documents.

The process of retrieving data from file types that would normally require each file to be manually reviewed is known as *knowledge mining*. To learn more about knowledge mining, see [Microsoft Learn - Implement knowledge mining with Azure Cognitive Search](/training/paths/implement-knowledge-mining-azure-cognitive-search/).

## Augmenting manual data entry

Many transactional use cases require manual intervention - but data entry can be tedious and lead to errors. Document Intelligence can integrate into existing applications and provide a standard JSON response, allowing developers to check manual data entry with Document Intelligence. The standard responses allow simple logic to check if data points from the manual data entry and Document Intelligence are different - for example, if a decimal place was missed during manual data entry. Checking manual data entry can help to reduce errors and increase accountability in businesses. For instance, banks can make sure that customers aren't getting loans they shouldn't be, or that they aren't being denied over small, human errors, like a misplaced decimal point.
