There are many scenarios where form and document analysis is required. Here are a few that offer insight into some of the many applications that use Azure AI Document Intelligence. After going through them, you can envision other ways to integrate Document Intelligence into your applications.

## Bulk data extraction

Organizations often receive various types of forms, which can be difficult to extract data from without laborious manual data entry. Document Intelligence allows organizations to extract the data digitally and combine it with existing operational systems and data storage services. This bulk data extraction provides insight and delivers value to customers and business users.

For example, insurance providers utilize Document Intelligence's custom model function to extract key data without the need for heavy manual intervention. The result is claims are processed quicker and accurately. The ability to integrate into existing systems and add functionality can be vital during disruptive events. For example, an event such as a pandemic, can result in more claims being filed and having fewer people available to manually go through the forms and documents.

## Integration with Azure Cognitive Search

Many organizations harbor troves of historical data. Azure Cognitive Search provides a sophisticated, effective way to search for that data. By integrating Document Intelligence with Azure Cognitive Search, you can harness the capabilities of both services. The integration enables automatic search, analysis, and retrieval of information that would normally stay hidden within files  such as photographs of documents.

The process of retrieving data from file types that would normally require each file to be manually reviewed is known as *knowledge mining*. To learn more about knowledge mining, see [Microsoft Learn - Implement knowledge mining with Azure Cognitive Search](/training/paths/implement-knowledge-mining-azure-cognitive-search/).

## Augmenting manual data entry

Many transactional use cases require manual intervention - but data entry can be tedious and lead to errors. Document Intelligence can integrate with existing applications and provide a structured JSON response.  Developers can check manual data entry accuracy with Document Intelligence. Standard responses allow simple logic to check if data points from the manual data entry and Document Intelligence differ. If a decimal place was missed during manual data entry, for example. Checking manual data entry can help reduce errors and increase accountability in business processes.
