Whether you're running a public-facing application that handles massive amounts of traffic or an internal business API that manages critical data for internal systems, your users expect a system that performs well. Scaling your system to handle load, identifying network bottlenecks, and optimizing your storage performance are important tasks to ensure your users have the best experience.

In this module, you'll learn about the *performance efficiency* pillar of the Azure Well-Architected Framework.

The concepts discussed in this module aren't all inclusive. They represent some of the important aspects to consider when you build a solution on the cloud. For more details on the Azure Well-Architected Framework, go to the [Azure Architecture Center](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/framework?azure-portal=true) as you start to plan and design your architecture.

## Learning objectives

By the end of this module, you'll be able to:

- Scale your capacity based on workload.
