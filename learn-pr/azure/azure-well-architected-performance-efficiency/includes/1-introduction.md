The Azure Well-Architected Framework is a guide that helps ensure that your workload is: 

- Resilient, available, and recoverable.
- As secure as you need it to be.
- Worth the investment.
- Developed and operated responsibly.
- **Meeting its goals on time.**

Performance efficiency is the ability of your workload to adjust to changes in demands. A workload must be able to handle an increase in load without compromising user experience. And when there's a decrease in load, the workload must conserve its resources. Capacity, or how much CPU and memory you have available, plays a major role in performance.

You don't want your workload design to just depend on pre-configured capacity. That approach might work fine up to a point, but after you go over that limit, the workload might slow down or even crash. And if you're under the capacity limit, you're still burning through resources that you don't need, which means extra costs.

To keep your workload running smoothly over time, you need a good strategy that helps you stay on top of your performance goals. Don't treat performance like something you'll deal with later if problems come up in production. Instead, consider it right from the start of the design process.

The concepts described in this module aren't all-inclusive of performance efficiency in a workload, but they represent the core principles and some of their key approaches. For a complete overview of the Well-Architected Framework pillars, check out the [Well-Architected Framework](/azure/well-architected) as you start planning and designing your architecture.

Each unit in this module dives into one [design principle](/azure/well-architected/cost-optimization/principles) and three approaches for that principle. You can find examples of the approaches in each unit to see how they can be applied to real-world scenarios. The examples are all based on fictional companies.
