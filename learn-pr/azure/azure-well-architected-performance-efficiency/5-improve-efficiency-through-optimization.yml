  questions:
  - content: 'How did the Contoso team change their development process to address ongoing performance issues?'
    choices:
    - content: 'They removed their team from internal messaging groups.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'Incorrect. The team needed to dedicate time to address performance issues, not remove themselves from internal messaging groups.'
    - content: 'They dedicated time during each cycle to address performance issues.'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: 'By dedicating time during each cycle to address performance issues, the team was able to address longstanding issues and continuously improve the efficiency of their workload.'
    - content: 'They added more developers to the team.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. In this case, the team needed to dedicate time to address performance issues, not add more developers to the team."
    - content: 'They stopped development of new functions'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Stopping the development of new functions would be a drastic and unnecessary measure."
