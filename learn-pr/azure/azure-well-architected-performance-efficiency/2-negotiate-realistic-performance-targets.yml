  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "Why did Contoso's technical team need to research performance capabilities in Azure?"
    choices:
    - content: 'The team wanted to verify that the performance targets they had already negotiated were realistic.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'Incorrect. The team needed this information to prepare for the negotiations.'
    - content: 'They needed to deploy a proof of concept to test the performance of the platform.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'Incorrect. Before a proof of concept is designed, performance targets must be negotiated. The team needed this information to prepare for the negotiations.'
    - content: 'The team was ready to deploy the workload to production.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The team was preparing to negotiate performance targets with stakeholders, and needed to understand this information before they began negotiations."
    - content: 'The team needed to prepare for performance target negotiations.'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. It’s crucial that you’re  well prepared for negotiations. Understanding your platform's capabilities before you begin negotiating will help you set realistic targets that are achievable."
  - content: 'Which of the following is an example of the types of points that you should cover in a performance target negotiation?'
    choices:
    - content: 'The performance targets for each Azure resource to be deployed.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. At this stage in the process, you haven't yet defined which individual resources might be deployed, so keeping a broad perspective is recommended."
    - content: 'The anticipated growth pattern of the workload.'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: 'Correct. The anticipated growth pattern of the workload is an important factor to include when working on identifying performance targets.'
    - content: 'The tolerable amount of downtime for the workload.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This is a reliability consideration, not a performance consideration. It's important to keep these two concepts separate."
    - content: 'The operations headcount required to support the workload.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While workload costs are an important consideration, this isn't a performance consideration. It's important to keep these two concepts separate."
  - content: 'True or false: Performance targets should be contextualized in terms of workload flows, not individual resources.'
    choices:
    - content: 'True.'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: 'Correct. Identifying flows and their performance targets is a more effective way to ensure that critical functions of the workload are designed appropriately.'
    - content: 'False.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'Incorrect. Identifying flows and their performance targets is a more effective way to ensure that critical functions of the workload are designed appropriately.'
