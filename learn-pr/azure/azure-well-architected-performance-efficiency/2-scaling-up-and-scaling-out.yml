  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:

  - content: 'Which is the most accurate description of scaling out?'
    choices:
    - content: 'Increasing the amount of resources allocated to an instance'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'Increasing the amount of resources of a single instance is a description for scaling up.'
    - content: 'Increasing the number of instances serving requests'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: 'Scaling out increases the number of instances service requests.'
    - content: 'Adding additional storage to a virtual machine'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Adding additional storage isn't an example of scaling out."
    - content: 'Reaching the maximum level of scale for your application'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Reaching the maximum level of scale for your application can be addressed by scaling out but isn't an accurate description of scaling out."

  - content: 'Which is the most accurate description of scaling down?'
    choices:
    - content: 'Decreasing the number of instances serving requests'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'Decreasing the number of instances serving requests is scaling in.'
    - content: 'Taking ownership of how your application scales'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Taking ownership of how your application scales isn't scaling down."
    - content: 'Decreasing the amount of resources allocated to an instance'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: 'Scaling down is the reduction of resources that a single instance has available.'
    - content: 'Remaining below the maximum level of scale for your application'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This isn't a description of scaling down."

  - content: 'Which of the following is *not* a consideration when you build a scaling strategy into your application?'
    choices:
    - content: 'The backup retention policies for your instances'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "While it's important to define the backup retention policies, it's unrelated to the ability of your application to scale."
    - content: 'State management of your application'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "State management is important to consider when you build a scaling strategy. Scaling requires you to store user state outside of the individual instances to ensure the user experience isn't broken as instances are added and removed."
    - content: 'Startup time of your instances'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'Startup time is an important consideration in a scaling strategy. As the time to start an instance decreases, the quicker your application can react to increased demand.'
    - content: 'Automating the scaling of your instances based on a metric or schedule'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Scaling automation is an important piece of a scaling strategy. As you automate your scaling capabilities, you'll have greater ability to handle fluctuations in user load without manual intervention or poor user experience."
