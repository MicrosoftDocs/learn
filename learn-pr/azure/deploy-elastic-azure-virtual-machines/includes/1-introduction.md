Among Elastic on Azure deployment options, Elastic on Azure VMs provides users the most control over the underlying Azure infrastructure. Teams with established orchestration practices around Azure IaaS tend to choose this option. In cases where customers want to migrate on-premises Elasticsearch on Linux deployments to Azure, they may pick this option to minimize rearchitecture. 

## Example scenario

Imagine that you work for a startup retailer that uses Elastic on-premises to manage sales transactions. The company would like to move it to the cloud to improve data accessibility for remote workers from other departments. Moving to the cloud would also reduce the IT burden of procuring and maintaining infrastructure. You help by offering to migrate the workload as-is to Azure VMs, beginning with deploying Elastic on Azure VMs.

## What will we be doing?

Through the course of this module, we'll discuss the steps and considerations for migrating an Elastic workload to an Azure VM. The exercises require a pay-as-you-go Azure subscription, and may incur a nominal fee. To keep costs low, you can either sign up for a free trial or set the VM to the smallest size. Be sure to take it down when the exercise is over.

## What is the main goal?

By the end of this module, you'll be able to deploy Elastic on Azure VMs.
