  questions:
    - content: John is granting permission to an application registered within the Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant. Which of the following permissions will allow a daemon application to authenticate as itself without user interaction and call Microsoft Graph?
      choices:
        - content: Application permissions
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: Correct. Application permissions are used by apps that run without a signed-in user present, for example, apps that run as background services or daemons.
        - content: Delegated permissions
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. Delegated permissions are used by apps that have a signed-in user present. For these apps, either the user or an administrator consents to the permissions that the app requests. The app is delegated with the permission to act as a signed-in user when it makes calls to the target resource. 
        - content: Effective permissions
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. Effective permissions are the permissions that your app has when it makes requests to the target resource. 
    - content: A company is adding the Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL) for Python to an existing project. Which of the following commands will install MSAL for Python?
      choices:
        - content: pip install -r requirements.txt
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. The MSAL for Python is new library being introduced to the project and doesn't exist in the requirements.txt configuration file.
        - content: pip install msal
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: Correct. Python pip is the package manager for Python packages. We can use pip to install packages that don't come with Python.
        - content: python install msal
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. The command is wrong and Python interpreter try to run a file.
    - content: John is building a new confidential client application for his company. Which of the following token grant flows does a confidential client application use?
      choices:
        - content: OAuth 2.0 authorization code flow
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. The OAuth 2.0 authorization code grant type, or auth code flow, enables a client application to obtain authorized access to protected resources like web APIs.
        - content: OAuth 2.0 On-Behalf-Of flow
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. The OAuth 2.0 On-Behalf-Of flow (OBO) serves the use case where an application invokes a service/web API, which in turn needs to call another service/web API. The idea is to propagate the delegated user identity and permissions through the request chain.
        - content: OAuth 2.0 client credentials flow
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: Correct. The OAuth 2.0 client credentials grant flow permits a web service (confidential client) to use its own credentials, instead of impersonating a user, to authenticate when calling another web service.
