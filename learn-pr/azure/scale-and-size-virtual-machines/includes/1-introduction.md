Azure gives you the tools you need to manage the size and number of your virtual machines. 

Suppose you work at a company that sells children’s toys online. Your web server runs on an Azure virtual machine. Much of your demand is seasonal and predictable; for example, the load on your server increases before major holidays. Demand will sometimes spike without warning; for example, the unexpected success of a movie can drive demand for related toys.

Your goal is to identify the expected loads throughout the year. You will then create a management plan to ensure your virtual machines have enough CPU, memory, and storage hardware to handle the demand.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you will:
- Vertically scale virtual machines by resizing
- Horizontally scale virtual machines by using scale sets
- Configure autoscaling
