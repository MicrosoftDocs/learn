Suppose you're an IT administrator for a large retail organization. Your organization has started using Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) to allow employees to securely sign in and use software as a service (SaaS) apps and access the organization's resources in Microsoft 365. You're overwhelmed with password-reset requests, because you currently reset employees' passwords manually. To get these employees back to being productive quickly and reduce your workload, you decide to evaluate and set up self-service password reset in Azure AD.

In this module, you'll learn how Azure supports this feature and how to set it up.

By the end of this module, you'll be able to configure self-service password reset in Azure AD.
