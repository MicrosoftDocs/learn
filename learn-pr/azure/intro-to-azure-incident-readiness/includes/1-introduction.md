Microsoft categorizes cloud incidents into three types: *service incident*, *privacy incident*, and *security incident*.

- A *service incident* is an event or a series of events that can cause an interruption or degraded experience for customers who use one or more of Microsoft's services. These incidents are effectively unplanned downtime. This downtime includes outages impacting availability, performance degradation impacting users, and problems interfering with service administration and management.

- A *privacy incident* is a potential unauthorized use or disclosure of customer data.

- A *security incident* is a confirmed breach that leads to destruction, loss, or unauthorized disclosure of customer data, or access to customer or personal data while being processed by Microsoft.
