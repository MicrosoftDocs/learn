Providing different Azure support options allows Azure customers to choose a plan that best fits their needs.

## Support-plan availability and billing

The support plans available and how you are charged depends on the type of Azure customer you are, and the type of Azure subscription you have.

For example, Developer support is not available to Enterprise customers. Enterprise customers can purchase Standard, Professional Direct, and Premier support plans, and be billed for support as part of an Enterprise Agreement (EA). Alternatively, if you purchase a support plan within a pay-as-you-go subscription, your support plan is charged to your monthly Azure subscription bill.

## Other support options
Several additional support channels are available outside Azure's official support plans.
