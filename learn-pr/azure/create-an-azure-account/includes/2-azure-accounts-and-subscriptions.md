You can purchase Azure access directly from Microsoft by signing up on the Azure website or through a Microsoft representative. You can also purchase Azure access through a Microsoft partner. Cloud Solution Provider partners offer a range of complete managed-cloud solutions for Azure.

If you're new to Azure, you can sign up for a free account on the Azure website to start exploring at no cost to you. Once you're ready, you can choose to upgrade and start paying for the Azure services you use above the free amounts.

## What is the Azure free account?

This is an excellent way for new users to get started and explore. To sign up, you need a phone number, a credit card, and a Microsoft or GitHub account. Credit card information is used for identity verification only. You won't be charged for any services until you upgrade.

## Azure purchasing options

With flexible purchasing options, you can choose the option that works best for you. Use one of the following three ways to buy Azure:

- **Azure.com**: Buying directly through [Azure.com](https://azure.com) is the fastest and easiest way for organizations of all sizes to get started with Azure. You can manage your Azure deployments and usage yourself and get a monthly bill from Microsoft for the services used.  
- **Microsoft representative**: Buying Azure through a Microsoft representative is intended for large organizations or customers who already work with one. You'll also manage your Azure deployments and usage yourself and get a monthly bill from Microsoft for the services used.  
- **Microsoft partner**: If you buy Azure as a managed service through your partner, your partner will provide you with access to Azure, manage your billing, and provide support.
