      choices:
      - content: "`rid` and `gid` represent the specific route and geofence to be displayed on the map"
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "Correct!"
      - content: "`rid` and `gid` represent the specific route and group of buses to be displayed on the map"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "This description isn't what `gid` references."
      - content: "`rid` and `gid` represent all the routes and geofences"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "These parameters don't represent all of them, only what is specified."
      - content: "`rid` and `gid` represent all the routes and groups of buses"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "This description isn't what `gid` references, and these parameters don't represent all of them, only what is specified."
    - content: "What is the order of serving data to the front end?"
      choices:
      - content: "The client application obtains the parameters and passes them to Azure SQL Database, which returns the relevant data to the Azure Function."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "The client application doesn't call Azure SQL Database directly."
      - content: "The Azure Function obtains the parameters and passes them to the client application, then the client application gets the relevant data from Azure SQL Database and displays it in the client application."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "The URL parameters are obtained by the client application and then passed to the Azure Function."
      - content: "The client application obtains the parameters and passes them to the Azure Function, then the Azure Function gets the relevant data from Azure SQL Database and returns it to the client application."
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "Correct!"
      - content: "Azure SQL Database obtains the parameters and passes them to the Azure Function, then the Azure Function gets the relevant data from the client application and returns it to Azure SQL Database."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Azure SQL Database isn't parsing the URL parameters. It must be called with a stored procedure or query including the parameters."
