Azure Static Web Apps combines the power of Azure App Service and Azure Functions so you can publish static web pages with associated APIs with ease.

Suppose you work for the transportation department of a major city and you want to increase the number of bus riders. To make it convenient to jump on the bus, you want to build a web app that allows users to monitor a bus’s progress along its route. By providing up to the second information on the whereabouts of the next bus along the route, you can help potential riders eliminate the situation where they either end up waiting for the bus or running to catch the bus and missing it. You also want to give users the option to get notified when a bus they want to take is nearby.

Throughout this module and the associated learning path, you'll follow the scenario (and the development of a solution) of catching the bus. There's a complete learning path dedicated to exploring each piece of the following architecture. In this module, you'll create and deploy a website that can be used to track real-time location of buses.

In the language of your choice (Node.js, Python, or .NET), you'll use an Azure Static Web App to build a website that surfaces geospatial data from Azure SQL Database on a map. You'll also use GitHub Actions for CI/CD.

By the end of this module, you'll be able to build new applications in Azure quickly and integrate them with serverless APIs, geospatial data, and Azure SQL Database.

## Learning objectives
