Azure Arc promises to bridge the gap between on-premises and cloud environments by providing a consistent operational approach, agility, automation, and hyperscale of the Azure platform and its services. In this module, you learn about planning and securely deploying Arc-enabled servers at scale to realize Azure Arc's capabilities.

Suppose you're an IT administrator at Wide World Importers, a leading import-export business specializing in trans-Atlantic routes. The company is organized around six regional offices based in key port cities. While you work at Headquarters, each regional office has its own IT infrastructure, running unique inventory and logistics software. While some regional offices rely on Azure, others have their own on-premises datacenter and resources in other public clouds.  

Wide World Importers is expanding to two new regional offices, each of which is developing its own IT infrastructure. Furthermore, a cyberattack recently targeted one of Wide World Importer's on-premises datacenters, creating a logistical bottleneck with negative revenue impacts. Worldwide Importers faces increasing operational overhead and security vulnerabilities. It has a fragile IT infrastructure distributed across on-premises and multicloud environments, and the company is under pressure to ensure improved management of its servers.

Wide World Importers decides that Azure Arc-enabled servers can offer them unified security, governance, and insights across their digital estate. As Wide World Importers is ready to use Azure Arc-enabled servers, you're tasked with the testing, planning, and deployment of the service. You're responsible for securely onboarding thousands of machines to Azure Arc.
