Azure Arc promises to bridge the gap between on-premises and cloud environments by providing consistent operational approach, agility, automation, and hyperscale of the Azure platform and its services. In this module, you'll learn about planning and securely deploying Arc-enabled servers at scale to realize Azure Arc's capabilities.

Suppose you're an IT administrator at Wide World Importers, a leading import-export business specializing in trans-Atlantic routes. The company is organized around six regional offices based in key port cities. While you work at Headquarters, each regional office has its own IT infrastructure, running unique inventory and logistics software. While some regional offices rely on Azure, others have their own on-premises datacenter and resources in other public clouds.  

Wide World Importers is expanding to two new regional offices, each of which will develop its own IT infrastructure. Furthermore, one of Wide World Importer's on-premises datacenters was targeted by a cyberattack, creating a logistical bottleneck with negative revenue impacts. Worldwide Importers faces increasing operational overhead and security vulnerabilities with a fragile IT infrastructure distributed across on-premises and multi-cloud environments, and the company is under pressure to ensure improved management of its servers.

Azure Arc-enabled servers offers Wide World Imports with unified security, governance, and insights across their digital estate. As Wide World Imports is ready to use Azure Arc-enabled servers, you're tasked with the testing, planning, and deployment of the service. You'll be responsible for securely onboarding thousands of machines to Azure Arc.
