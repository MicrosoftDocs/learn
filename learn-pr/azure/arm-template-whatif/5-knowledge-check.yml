  questions:
  - content: What scenario describes most accurately the benefits of using the what-if operation when you're deploying a resource in Azure?
    choices:
    - content: To validate if an ARM template uses recommended practices at the time of deployment.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. The what-if operation lets you see how resources will change if you deploy the template. To check your template for recommended practices, use the Bicep linter for Bicep files, or the ARM Template Test Toolkit (ARM-TTK) for JSON ARM templates.
    - content: To verify the effects and impact of the deployment of the template.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. The what-if operation lets you see how resources will change if you deploy the template. The what-if operation doesn't make any changes to existing resources. Instead, it predicts the changes if the specified template is deployed.
    - content: To deploy the template in a sandbox environment in order to validate if the results of the deployment match expected results.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. The what-if operation evaluates the effects the deployment of the template against the target environment without making *any* changes to the environment.
  - content: What's the effect of using *complete mode* when deploying?
    choices:
    - content: Resources that aren't specified in the template are removed.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. In complete mode, Resource Manager deletes any resources that aren't declared in the template.
    - content: Existing resources are left unchanged, even if they're not specified in the template.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. This behavior is called *incremental mode* and is the opposite of complete mode.
    - content: You're asked to complete the deployment with a yes/no prompt.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. The *confirm switch* generates this prompt.
    - content: A resource is waiting for another resource to finish deploying before deployment can begin.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. Resource Manager handles this situation itself, most of the time.
  - content: |
      You have a resource group that contains a storage account named `storageaccount1`.
      You have a template file that declares a storage account named `storageaccount2`.
      You execute a what-if operation and use the incremental deployment mode.
      Which of these change types does the what-if operation detect?
    choices:
    - content: Delete
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. The Delete change type is returned when the deployment runs in complete mode.
    - content: Ignore
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. The what-if command detects that `storageaccount1` is already deployed to the resource group but isn't in the template. Because you specified the incremental deployment mode, it returns the Ignore change type for `storageaccount1`.
    - content: NoChange
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. The NoChange change type is returned when a resource defined in the template is already deployed in the resource group.
