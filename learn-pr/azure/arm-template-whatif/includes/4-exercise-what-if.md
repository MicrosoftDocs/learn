[!INCLUDE [Sandbox explanation](../../includes/azure-template-exercise-sandbox-subscription.md)]

The design team at your toy company has asked you to update a template that configures a virtual network. In this unit, you use what-if to verify the effects of deploying the updated template.

During the process, you'll:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Create and deploy an initial template.
> * Prepare to deploy a template that's slightly different, and use the what-if operation to review the expected changes.
> * Use a complete deployment to deploy an empty template, and use the what-if operation to review the expected changes.

## Create the starting template

You start with an existing template that your team has been using. The template creates the virtual network.

::: zone pivot="jsonpowershell,jsoncli"

1. Open Visual Studio Code.

1. Create a new file called *azuredeploy.json*.

1. Save the empty file so that Visual Studio Code loads the ARM template tooling.

   You can either select **File** > **Save As** or select <kbd>Ctrl+S</kbd> in Windows (<kbd>⌘+S</kbd> on macOS). Be sure to remember where you've saved the file. For example, you might want to create a *scripts* folder to save it in.

1. Copy the following code into *azuredeploy.json*.

   :::code language="json" source="code/4-template-before.json" :::

1. Save the template.

::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="biceppowershell,bicepcli"

1. Open Visual Studio Code.

1. Create a new file called *main.bicep*.

1. Save the empty file so that Visual Studio Code loads the Bicep tooling.

   You can either select **File** > **Save As** or select <kbd>Ctrl+S</kbd> in Windows (<kbd>⌘+S</kbd> on macOS). Be sure to remember where you've saved the file. For example, you might want to create a *scripts* folder to save it in.

1. Copy the following code into *main.bicep*.

   :::code language="bicep" source="code/4-template-before.bicep" :::

1. Save the template.

::: zone-end

## Deploy the template to Azure

## Verify the deployment

To validate that your deployment has been created and sent to Azure, go to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com?azure-portal=true) and make sure you're in the sandbox subscription:

   1. Select your avatar in the upper corner of the page.

   1. Select **Switch directory**. In the list, select the **Microsoft Learn Sandbox** directory.

   1. Select **Resource groups**.

   1. Select <rgn>[sandbox resource group name]</rgn>.

   1. In **Overview**, you see that one deployment succeeded.

   1. Select **1 Succeeded** to see the details of the deployment.

      :::image type="content" source="../media/4-portal-deployment-success.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Azure portal interface for the deployments, with the one deployment listed and a succeeded status." :::

   1. Select the **main** deployment to see what resources were deployed. In this case, one virtual network (address space 10.0.0.0/16) with two subnets has been deployed.

      :::image type="content" source="../media/4-portal-deployment-details.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Azure portal interface for the specific deployment, with no resources listed." :::

      :::image type="content" source="../media/4-portal-deployment-details-2.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Azure portal interface for the specific deployment, with one virtual network resource listed." :::

      Leave the page open in your browser so you can check on deployments again later.

## Modify the template

::: zone pivot="jsonpowershell,jsoncli"

1. In the *azuredeploy.json* file in Visual Studio Code, delete the tag named `Owner` and its value. After you're done, the `tags` property of the virtual network should look like this:

   :::code language="json" source="code/4-template-after.json" range="12-14" :::

1. Update the `addressPrefixes` to change `/16` to `/15`. After you're done, the `addressSpace` property of the virtual network should look like this:

   :::code language="json" source="code/4-template-after.json" range="16-20" :::

1. Delete the subnet named `subnet001`. Make sure to delete the whole subnet object. After you're done, the `subnets` property of the virtual network should look like this:

   :::code language="json" source="code/4-template-after.json" range="23-30" :::

1. Save the template.

::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="biceppowershell,bicepcli"

1. In the *main.bicep* file in Visual Studio Code, delete the tag named `Owner` and its value. After you're done, the `tags` property of the virtual network should look like this:

   :::code language="bicep" source="code/4-template-after.bicep" range="6-8" :::

1. Update the `addressPrefixes` to change the `/16` to `/15`. After you're done, the `addressSpace` property of the virtual network should look like this:

   :::code language="bicep" source="code/4-template-after.bicep" range="10-14" :::

1. Delete the subnet named `subnet001`. Make sure to delete the whole subnet object. After you're done, the `subnets` property of the virtual network should look like this:

   :::code language="bicep" source="code/4-template-after.bicep" range="17-24" :::

1. Save the template.

::: zone-end

## Run the what-if command with the modified template

::: zone pivot="biceppowershell"

Run `New-AzResourceGroupDeployment` with the `-WhatIf` flag to perform the what-if operation.

```powershell
New-AzResourceGroupDeployment `
  -Name main `
  -WhatIf `
  -TemplateFile main.bicep
```

::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="jsonpowershell"

Run `New-AzResourceGroupDeployment` with the `-WhatIf` flag to perform the what-if operation.

```powershell
New-AzResourceGroupDeployment `
  -Name main `
  -WhatIf `
  -TemplateFile azuredeploy.json
```

::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="bicepcli"

Run `az deployment group what-if` to perform the what-if operation:

```azurecli
az deployment group what-if \
  --template-file main.bicep
```

::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="jsoncli"

Run `az deployment group what-if` to perform the what-if operation:

```azurecli
az deployment group what-if \
  --template-file azuredeploy.json
```

::: zone-end

The what-if output is similar to the following one:

::: zone pivot="jsoncli,bicepcli"

[!include[](exercise/whatif-output-cli.md)]

::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="jsonpowershell,biceppowershell"

[!include[](exercise/whatif-output-powershell.md)]

::: zone-end

Notice that the result is color-coded in addition to having a prefix:

* Purple and **~** for any modifications
* Green and **+** for new resources to be created
* Orange and **-** for deletions

## Remove the resources in the template

::: zone pivot="jsonpowershell,jsoncli"

1. Update the *azuredeploy.json* file in Visual Studio Code, and remove all of the contents of the `resources` array. When you're done, your template should look like this:

   :::code language="json" source="code/4-template-empty.json" :::

1. Save the template.

::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="biceppowershell,bicepcli"

1. In the *main.bicep* file in Visual Studio Code, delete all of the contents of the file but don't delete the file itself.

1. Save the template.

::: zone-end

## Deploy by using complete mode and the confirmation option

In these next steps, you'll deploy an empty template over your existing environment.
