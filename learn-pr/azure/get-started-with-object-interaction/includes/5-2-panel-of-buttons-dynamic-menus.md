## UI buttons

Buttons help the user to trigger an immediate action. It's one of the foundational components MRTK provides. You can use various kinds of button prefabs, depending on your situation. The Button is based on the `StatefulInteractable` script component to offer smooth UI controls on different interactive surfaces. The `StatefulInteractable` component is an all-in-one box to make any item interactable. `StatefulInteractable` acts as a catch-all, considering all forms of entering consisting of touch, hand rays, speech, and so on, and funnels those interactions into activities and visible subject responses.

## UI menu

Menu is a UX control, which offers a set of buttons or different UI components. It's floating across the user's frame and effortlessly available anytime. Because it's loosely coupled to the person, it no longer disturbs the user's interplay with the target content. The user can use the 'Pin' button to world-lock/unlock the menu. The user can grab the menu at a selected position and relocate it to a selected position.
