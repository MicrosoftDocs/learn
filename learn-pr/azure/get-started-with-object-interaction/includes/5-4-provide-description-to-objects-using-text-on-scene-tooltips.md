## Textmesh Pro

Some of the MRTK assets and prefabs require TextMesh Pro. TextMesh Pro is Unity’s text component. TextMesh Pro helps in dynamically changing the appearance by directly changing the material properties. Textmesh Pro uses custom shaders and advanced text rendering techniques to deliver visual quality improvements. TextMesh Pro must be added to your project by importing TMP Essential Resources.
