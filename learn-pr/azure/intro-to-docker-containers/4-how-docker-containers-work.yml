  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:

  - content: "A container is launched using the --publish 8080:80 flag. Which of the following options is the most likely network configuration used for the container?"
    choices:
    - content: "none"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "None is the network configuration that disables networking for containers."
    - content: "bridge"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "The Bridge network configuration is an internal, private network used by the container and isolates the container network from the Docker host network. We use the publish flag to map ports between the container and host ports."
    - content: "host"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The Host network configuration allows the container to use the host's IP address and ports. The publish flag isn't used with this network."
 
  - content: "Which storage option is the best choice that allows the host and container to share a file to manage name server resolution, for example the resolve.conf file on Linux?"
    choices:
    - content: "A volume"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "A volume is stored on the host filesystem at a specific folder location. However, volume data isn't meant to be updated by the host."
    - content: "Bind mount"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "A bind mount, like a volume, is stored on the host filesystem at a specific folder location. However, bind mount data is expected to be updated by the host. The resolve.conf contents is expected to change by the host and used by both the container and host."
