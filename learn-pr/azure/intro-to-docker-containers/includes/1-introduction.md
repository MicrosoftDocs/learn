Teams today must release apps quickly to attract and keep business. This requirement forces software-development and support teams to always look at solutions that save time and reduce costs. An ideal solution reduces the time spent on creating and configuring deployment environments and simplifies the software deployment process.

The idea of using software containerization technology as a time-saving and cost-reduction solution is popular. One of the strengths of containerization is that you don't have to configure hardware and spend time installing operating systems and software to host a deployment. Containers are isolated from each other, and multiple containers can run on the same hardware. This configuration helps us use hardware more efficiently and can help improve our application's security.

Suppose you work for an online clothing retailer that's planning the development of several internal apps. Your team develops and tests all applications on-premises and then deploys them to Azure for pre-production testing and final production hosting. You're looking for maximum compatibility in each environment with little or no configuration changes. Using Docker as a containerization solution seems an ideal choice.

Here, you'll learn how you can use Docker to create your own containers. You'll also learn a bit about how Docker infrastructure works behind the scenes. The goal is to help you decide if Docker containers are the right choice for your business.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you will:

- Evaluate whether Docker is an appropriate containerization platform for you.
- Describe how the components of Docker containers support compute container implementations.

## Prerequisites

- Knowledge of operating system virtualization concepts at a beginner level
- Knowledge of command-line based applications at a beginner level
