      explanation: "Docker Desktop runs on macOS, but it's not the only supported desktop operating system."
    - content: "Linux only"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Docker Desktop currently is not available for the Linux desktop operating systems. However, Docker Desktop for Windows does support using a Linux command line via Windows Subsystem for Linux. For more information and set up, see the [WSL + Docker documentation](/windows/wsl/tutorials/wsl-containers)."
    - content: "Windows, macOS, and Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "While Docker Desktop is only available for Windows and macOS, it does support using a Linux command line via Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). For more information and set up, see the [WSL + Docker documentation](/windows/wsl/tutorials/wsl-containers)."

  - content: "Which is correct Docker command to rebuild a container image?"
    choices:

      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "You use the docker build command to rebuild a container image. Once you've built an image, the image can't be changed. The only way to change an image is to create a new image."

Docker containers running on Linux share the host OS kernel and don't require a container OS as long as the binary can access the OS kernel directly."
    - content: "A container image is a set of commands that builds a container."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "A container image doesn't include commands to build a container."
