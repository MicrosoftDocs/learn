title: Foundations of Serverless Computing for Developers

summary: | 
  It's time to go back to school and you're working on a solution for a school supplies retailer.
  In the past, they had users complain about slow website response times during the back-to-school time. 
  This year, the shop wants to be prepared. 
  Customers should enjoy a highly responsive shopping experience when millions of kids head back to school and buy pencils, glue, rulers, markers, and many other supplies.
  The development team decides to overhaul the website and re-implement inventory management using Azure technology.
  Instead of the monolithic solution that tightly couples the customer-facing user interface and the inventory system,
  they now plan a decoupled system, where the shopping website communicates with the inventory system over 
  an HTTP API.
  They have already finished work on the new website. 
  Also, a cloud-based Cosmos DB storage solution with some test data is set up and configured.
  The part still missing is the new inventory system, which must be able to handle the spikes in seasonal
  demand without performance degradation. 
  Demand is lower during the remainder of the year, so the retailer doesn't want to pay for unused 
  infrastructure and is looking for a cost-efficient solution that can scale dynamically 
  while keeping maintenance requirements to a minimum.
  You want to identify the Azure services relevant for the project and get hands-on experience with them, 
  so you can successfully implement the optimal HTTP API.

abstract: | 
  In this Learn Live series, you will:
  - Design and implement a cost-efficient, and auto-scalable HTTP API using Azure Functions
  - Connect to other Azure resources using bindings
  - Configure your API to meet restful standards
  - Prevent unauthorized access during development
  - Document your API for mass consumption

prerequisites: |
  - Experienced as a junior web developer using JavaScript
  - Familiarity with how HTTP verbs and routes are used in restful services
  - Knows how to navigate Azure portal
  - Familiar with Visual Studio Code and its extensions concepts
  - Basic knowledge of the pros and cons of monolithic architectures versus decoupled architectures
