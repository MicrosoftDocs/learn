Distributing your HoloLens 2 application presents a crucial decision: whether to use the vast reach and convenience of the Microsoft Store or explore the flexibility of sideloading. In this unit, we delve into these two distinct distribution options.

## Microsoft Store

The Microsoft Store serves as the primary distribution channel for HoloLens 2 applications. Like other Microsoft platforms, the store provides a centralized marketplace where users can discover, download, and install applications for their HoloLens 2 devices. Developers can use the Microsoft Store's vast user base and its infrastructure for app delivery, updates, and monetization. Publishing an application to the Microsoft Store requires the successful completion of a submission process in which your application is vetted and tested for meeting compliance requirements.

## Sideloading

Sideloading the application package provides flexibility and convenience as it allows you to install your application on HoloLens 2 devices without going through the Microsoft Store. Creating an installer package for sideloading allows you to package your application into a format that can be easily installed on HoloLens 2 devices. To distribute the installer package, you can use other channels such as email, cloud storage, or USB drives. This method is useful for sharing your application with a specific audience, such as internal testing within an organization or providing early access to select users. By distributing the application outside the Microsoft Store, you have more control over the deployment process and can tailor it to meet your specific needs.

## Third-Party app stores

Apart from the official Microsoft Store, there are third-party platforms that cater to HoloLens 2 application distribution. These alternative stores may offer unique features, monetization models, or specialized content niches that can help developers reach specific target audiences. An example is SideQuest, a platform for distributing applications that can be sideloaded on HoloLens 2 and other devices. There are also industry-specific app marketplaces that focus on sectors like education, healthcare, or industrial applications.
