  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: What does the average **Health Probe Status** metric indicate?
    choices:
    - content: The number of virtual machines in the back-end pool that are responding to health probe requests.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: No. The average **Health Probe Status** shows the percentage of virtual machines in the back-end pool that are responding to health probe requests.
    - content: The percentage of virtual machines in the back-end pool that are responding to health probe requests.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: This answer is correct.
    - content: The number of virtual machines available that will respond to client requests.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: No. The average **Health Probe Status** shows the percentage of virtual machines in the back-end pool that are responding to health probe requests. Even if all virtual machines respond to a health probe, they might be inaccessible to clients because of other issues, such as NSG rules blocking requests from outside the subnet.
  - content: You're monitoring the average packet count metric for a load balancer. The average packet count suddenly increases by a significant amount, although the number of clients doesn't appear to have changed. What is the most probable cause?
    choices:
    - content: Additional virtual machines have become available in the back-end pool.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: No. The most probable cause is that one or more virtual machines in the back-end pool are no longer responding to health probe requests and are no longer participating in load balancing.
    - content: The load balancing rule has stopped directing traffic to one or more virtual machines in the back-end pool.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: No. The most probable cause is that one or more virtual machines in the back-end pool are no longer responding to health probe requests and are no longer participating in load balancing.
    - content: One or more virtual machines in the back-end pool are no longer responding to health probe requests and are no longer participating in load balancing.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: This answer is correct.
