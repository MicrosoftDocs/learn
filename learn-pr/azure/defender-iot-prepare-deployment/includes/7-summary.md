In this module, you prepared your OT site for Defender for IoT implementation, including:

- Examining a network diagram
- Deciding what devices and subnets to monitor
- Preparing your list of sensors
- Choosing the best traffic monitoring methods for your sensors
- Deciding what appliances to use for your sensors

In order to prepare, you:

- Built on your previous planning steps such as breaking your network into sites and zones.
- Analyzed your site diagram to determine which devices and subnets to monitor
- Checked the types of sensors you'd be using and matched them to traffic monitoring methods such as TAP or ERSPAN
- Mapped pre-configured or self-configured physical appliances or virtual appliances to the types of sensors you would be using

Preparing, along with your previous steps in planning, brings you closer to deploying your Defender for IoT implementation.
