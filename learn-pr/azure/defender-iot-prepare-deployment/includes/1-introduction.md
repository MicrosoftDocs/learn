Microsoft Defender for IoT provides comprehensive threat detection for Internet of Things (IoT)/operational technology (OT) environments, with multiple deployment options that include cloud-connected, fully on-premises, or hybrid.

This module describes the high-level steps required to prepare your deployment of Defender for IoT for operational technology monitoring.

## Example scenario

Suppose you work for a car manufacturer with offices and production sites across the globe. You're tasked with implementing a system to monitor traffic and secure your manufacturing automation systems (Operational Technology), from the access panels to the pneumatic and packaging systems. To take the organization's operational technology security visibility to the next level, your team chooses to use Microsoft Defender for IoT.

You chose the OT site to deploy to first, and planned your deployment including steps like dividing your network into sites and zones. Now you need to prepare your OT site and determine what devices and subnets to monitor. You'll also choose the best traffic monitoring methods for your sensors and review the appliance options available to use with your sensors.

## What will we be doing?

You'll perform steps involved in preparing an OT site for Microsoft Defender for IoT deployment. You prepare for deploying an OT monitoring system through actions such as:

- **Network traffic diagram analysis** - Examine a network traffic diagram and identify devices and subnets to monitor with Defender for IoT
- **Traffic monitoring** - Decide which traffic monitoring methods to use for your sensors
- **Appliance comparison** - Decide on which appliance to use based on the sensor specification

## What is the main goal?

By the end of this session, you prepare to deploy Microsoft Defender for IoT to monitor your OT networks.
