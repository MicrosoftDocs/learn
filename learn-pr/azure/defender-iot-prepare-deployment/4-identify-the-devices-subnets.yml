  questions:
  
  - content: "Figure 1 shows a network diagram depicting three floors, each with endpoints and switches. Floor three also houses  firewalls, core switches, a server, and routers. The blue dotted line depicts traffic traveling outside of the IP segment and the red line depicts interesting traffic. At which point should you put a Defender for IoT sensor - at point A, B, or C?"
    choices:
    - content: "A" 
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "We recommend placing your sensors in locations where they can stream interesting traffic to Defender for IoT. Interesting traffic is commonly located at the interfaces connecting between the default gateway entity to the core or distribution switch."
    - content: "B"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "While it could be useful to capture traffic traveling outside of the IP segment, placing a sensor in location B wouldn't transfer interesting traffic to Defender for IoT."
    - content: "C"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "While it could be useful to capture traffic traveling outside of the IP segment, placing a sensor in location C wouldn't transfer interesting traffic to Defender for IoT."  

  - content: "Which would be an interesting traffic point to identify?"
    choices:
    - content: "Traffic that is multi-directional."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Traffic that travels in two directions is interesting to monitor."
    - content: "Traffic that is unicast."
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: "Unicast only covers part of the traffic and is less interesting to monitor. Broadcast and multicast traffic are considered interesting points of traffic to monitor."
    - content: "Traffic that doesn't pose a risk to the network."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "You're interested in monitoring traffic that could pose a risk to your network."
