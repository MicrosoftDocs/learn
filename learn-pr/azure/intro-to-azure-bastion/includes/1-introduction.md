Server administrators understand that it's efficient to remotely administer and maintain servers in an on-premises datacenter. With Windows infrastructure as a service (IaaS) virtual machines (VMs) being deployed in Azure, administrators must rely solely on remote management to administer and maintain cloud-based resources. But how can administrators connect securely to remote cloud-based VMs without exposing the management interfaces of those VMs to the internet? Azure Bastion is a service you can use to securely connect to your Azure VMs remotely, without needing to expose remote administrative ports to the internet.

## Example scenario

Suppose you have a line-of-business (LOB) app that supports your organization's research department. In the past, this app ran on a couple of Windows Server computers in your head office datacenter. Whenever you needed to administer the app, you connected using Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) over TCP port **3389**. You also used Secure Shell (SSH), over port **22**, to administer the VMs. Because the app was hosted on a computing resource in a private datacenter, you had some concerns about access from malicious hackers over the internet. However, the app now runs on VMs hosted in Azure.

To connect to the VMs, you must now expose a public IP address on each VM for your RDP/SSH connections. However, potential protocol vulnerabilities make this type of connection undesirable. As a solution, you could use a jump box VM to act as an intermediary between your management console and the target VMs. Or, you could consider implementing Azure Bastion.

## What will we be doing?

Learning the benefits of using Azure Bastion to help protect your hosted VMs, by showing you how Azure Bastion:

- Removes the need to expose RDP and SSH ports to the internet.
- Securely uses both RDP and SSH.

## What is the main goal?

By the end of this session, you're able to determine how you can use Azure Bastion to help secure remote management sessions to your Azure hosted VMs.
