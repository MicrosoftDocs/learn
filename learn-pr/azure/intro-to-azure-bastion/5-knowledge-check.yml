      explanation: "Incorrect. Although administrators do use SSH, they also use other protocols."
    - content: "Both RDP and SSH"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Administrators typically use both RDP and SSH to remotely administer Azure VMs."
  - content: "When an administrator connects to Azure Bastion to open a remote connection to a hosted VM, which of the following connections occurs?"
    choices:
    - content: "Azure Bastion opens an RDP/SSH connection to the Azure VM using a private IP on the VM."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Azure Bastion uses only private IP connections to the target VMs."
    - content: "Azure Bastion opens an HTML5 connection to the Azure VM using a private IP on the VM."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Azure Bastion uses RDP/SSH connections to the target VM."
    - content: "Azure Bastion opens an RDP/SSH connection to the Azure VM using a public IP on the VM."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Azure Bastion uses only private IPs on the configured virtual network. The VMs don't need a public IP."
  - content: "When an administrator plans to deploy Azure Bastion, how and in which virtual network must they deploy it?"
    choices:
    - content: "They must deploy Azure Bastion in a different virtual network from the one that contains the VMs."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Azure Bastion must be in the same virtual network as the managed VMs."
    - content: "They must deploy Azure Bastion in the same virtual network as the one that contains the VMs, and in the same subnet."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Although Azure Bastion should be deployed in the same virtual network, it must be in a different subnet."
    - content: "They must deploy Azure Bastion in the same virtual network as the one that contains the VMs, and in a different subnet."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Azure Bastion must be deployed in the same virtual network (or peered virtual network) as the VMs, but in its own subnet."
  - content: "Your boss is concerned that by implementing Azure Bastion, you need to maintain it with patches and updates. Is your boss correct?"
    choices:
    - content: "No, your boss is wrong. Azure Bastion is a fully managed PaaS service that you don't need to patch or update."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Azure Bastion is a fully managed PaaS service that requires no customer patching or updating."
    - content: "Yes, your boss is partially correct. You must patch and update Azure Bastion, although not at regular intervals."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Azure Bastion is a fully managed PaaS service and requires no customer patching or updating."
    - content: "Yes, your boss is correct. You must periodically patch and update Azure Bastion."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Azure Bastion is a fully managed PaaS service and requires no customer patching or updating."
  - content: "When you deploy Azure Bastion, which of the following require a public IP?"
    choices:
    - content: "The Azure Bastion host in each virtual network requires a public IP."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Only the Azure Bastion host in each virtual network requires a public IP."
    - content: "The Azure Bastion host in each subnet in each virtual network requires a public IP."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Although Azure Bastion requires a public IP, you don't need to deploy it in each subnet, but rather in each virtual network."
    - content: "The VMs you want to connect to require a public IP."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Your VMs have only private IPs."
