  questions:
  - content: "How fast is real time?"
    choices:
    - content: "Two seconds"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Two seconds are too much for real-time requirements."
    - content: "An instant, more properly defined by your specific use case"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Real-time tasks are performed with almost no delay. The execution time should be defined in advance and monitored properly."
    - content: "Under 1 millisecond"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Wow, that's fast. Could be, but the execution time depends on your specific use case."
  - content: 'Which of the following databases are best to perform event-driven workloads?'
    choices:
    - content: Azure Cosmos DB
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Yes, Azure Cosmos DB ensures single-digit millisecond response times and automatic and instant scalability. But aren't you missing one?"
    - content: Azure Database for MySQL
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Azure Database for MySQL is a fully managed database service that lets developers quickly develop and deploy secure cloud-native applications also for event-driven workloads. But aren't you missing one?"
    - content: Azure Database for PostgreSQL
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Azure Database for PostgreSQL is a relational database service based on the open-source PostgreSQL database engine. It's a fully managed database as a service that can handle mission-critical workloads with predictable performance, security, high availability, and dynamic scalability. But aren't you missing one?"
    - content: All of them
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Yes. Using an event-driven workload doesn't limit you to a specific database. Choose the one that best fits your scenario."
  - content: "How should events be built?"
    choices:
    - content: "Events should be built generically."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Generic events might look like a good idea for improved maintainability but will likely result in large events and disable loose coupling."
    - content: "Events should be precise and lightweight."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. All events should be as precise and lightweight as possible to save network load and simplicity."
    - content: "Events should always follow a naming convention."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Naming conventions might be helpful, but for the overall event, building other things are more important."
