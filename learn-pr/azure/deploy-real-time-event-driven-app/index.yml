title: Build a real-time event-driven Java solution in Azure
summary: Send event-based telemetric data in real time to Azure Cosmos DB by using Azure Functions and an event hub.
abstract: |
  By the end of this module, you're able to:
  - Explain event-driven and real-time workloads.
  - Create a scenario with simulated telemetric data.
  - Send the telemetric data with an Azure function to an event hub.
  - Connect another function to this event hub to trigger storage in Azure Cosmos DB.
  - Have a look at the metrics in Application Insights to measure the performance and identify potential bottlenecks.
prerequisites: | 
  - An Azure subscription
  - Local installations of Java JDK (1.8 or later), Maven (3.0 or later), and the Azure CLI (2.12 or later)
  - Azure Functions Core Tools (2.6.66 or later)
