  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: 'Why do we clean our data before training?'
    choices:
    - content: "Removing rows of data makes our model more powerful"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While removing bad data makes models perform better, only removing data does not make models more powerful."
    - content: "Cleaning data helps us select features that will help the performance of the model"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Cleaning data might help us select features, but cleaning data is used to fix problems with the data."
    - content: "Removing rows that have errors prevents these rows from misleading the training process"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Cleaning data helps prevent errors from incomplete or error-prone data points."
  - content: 'What kind of data are best encoded with one-hot vectors?'
    choices:
    - content: "Ordinal data"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. One-hot vectors are best used in other areas where we have clear classes."
    - content: "Categorical data with two possible values"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This kind of data can simply be encoded in a single column as a 0 and a 1."
    - content: "Categorical data with three or more values"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. One-hot vectors are best used with multiple classes or categories so that models can better interpret them."
  - content: 'What is a data sample? What is a population?'
    choices:
    - content: "A sample is all possible data we care about. A population is the subset of that data which we actually have on hand"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A sample is a portion, or subset, of the data we care about. A population is all the available data."
    - content: "Both population and sample refer to data we use to train our model."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Although we can train models with population and sample data, they mean different things."
    - content: "A population is all possible data we care about. A sample is the subset of that data which we actually have on hand."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. A population is all the possible data we could collect for a data set, and a sample is a portion of the data which we already have."
  - content: "You have a model that does not perform well. Which of these will definitely **not** help improve its performance?"
    choices:
    - content: "Adding additional samples (rows)"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Adding rows of data will likely help your dataset become more representative, and so help your model train."
    - content: "Adding a small number of features (columns) that you know relate to what the model is trying to predict"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. So long as you have enough rows of data, adding relevant features is likely to help your model train."
    - content: "Adding a large number of features that you know have no relation to what the model is trying to predict."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Adding additional features that aren't relevant will probably harm its performance"
