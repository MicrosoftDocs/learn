As enrollment in your educational institution expands, you need to rapidly provision labs, while keeping the cost of managing those labs and the student VMs under control.

You've created a lab plan and a lab in Azure Lab Services, you choose a virtual machine operating system, you configured an auto shutdown policy to save costs, and you connected to a template VM to install required classroom software.

Imagine how much work it would take each educator to prepare a new classroom lab environment, and install all the necessary tools and software. As an educational institution, how would you keep track of all different OS versions and computing resources?

Azure Lab Services lets you simplify and accelerate the process of creating lab environments.

Now, when you want to create labs for uses such as classroom training in cybersecurity, programming, media, or non-classroom scenarios such as Hackathons, you can use Azure Lab Services to do it. You can use Azure Lab Services to provide educators with a self-service experience, while still maintaining control as an IT organization.

## Cleanup

Delete the resource group that contains the lab plan and lab to clean up your subscription.
