You needed to update your toy company's website deployment workflow so that it deploys more than just the Azure resources. You needed to deploy the website's code, and upload the product details and images.

In this module, you learned how to extend a Bicep deployment workflow to perform these tasks and others. You learned about the differences between control and data plane operations, and some of the tools that are available to work with the data planes of various Azure services. You updated your website's workflow to use these techniques.
