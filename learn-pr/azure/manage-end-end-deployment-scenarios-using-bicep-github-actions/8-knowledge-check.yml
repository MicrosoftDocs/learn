      You've created a workflow that deploys an Azure Cosmos DB account, database, and container.
      In your workflow's build job, you compile a small application that initializes the database with some reference data.
      You need to add the database initialization process to your workflow.
      Which of the following steps should you take?
    choices:
    - content: Use a separate tool like Chef or Puppet.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. Tools like Chef and Puppet aren't required, because your workflow can run the application directly.
    - content: Create a workflow artifact for the compiled initialization application.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. You can upload a workflow artifact for the application, and then run the application as part of a deployment job in your workflow.
    - content: Ensure that AzCopy is installed on your runner.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. AzCopy is used to manage storage accounts, not Azure Cosmos DB data.

      Your Bicep file includes a module that deploys an App Service app.
      You need to access the app's host name from your workflow but you can't currently do so.
      Which of the following reasons is most likely?
    choices:
    - content: You need to use a self-hosted runner.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. You don't need to use a self-hosted runner to access information from a Bicep file.
    - content: You need to use a deployment script.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. You don't need to use a deployment script to access information from a Bicep file.
    - content: You need to add an output to your Bicep template for the host name.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. Information from your Bicep file needs to be published as an output in your Bicep file before it's accessible by the rest of the workflow.
