The most important thing to remember from these three types of automated methods (math – control theory, menus – optimization algorithms, and manuals – expert systems or expert rules) is their strengths (when should you use each technology) and their limitations, as it's presented in the table below. Together with the Autonomous intelligence methods, it will allow us to select the best technology to solve each task or module in the Machine Teaching new AI paradigm.

The limitations of Automated methods are going to give us a hint of where other Autonomous Intelligence technologies, such as Machine Learning and Reinforcement Learning, can be used.

The strengths of Automated methods will complement Autonomous Intelligence technologies in their weaknesses.

The table summarizes the limitations of automated intelligence methods and explains when to use them.

|                                       | **What is it?**                                              | **When should you use it?**                                  | **What are the limitations?**                                |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Control Theory**                    | Uses math to calculate what to do next                       | •	When you need reliable, predictable control of processes that you can measure well. <br/>• When you understand the system dynamics well and can express them in mathematical terms. | •	It won't work when you can't model the system well with math.<br/>	•	It won't work when there are nonlinear relationships between the variables.<br/>• Will not change its behavior unless human experts retune the constants. |
| **Optimization algorithms**           | Search a list of options and select a control action using objective criteria | •	When you don’t have experience, or math to tell you what to do.<br/>	•	When the search landscape is large or where part of the search space is unexplored. <br/>• When there are many rules for decision-making (constraints) that need to be followed. | •	Do not understand the system or skills and strategies required to optimize the system. <br/>• Require significant time and computational resources to search options for the decisions they choose. |
| **Expert Systems /** **Expert rules** | A program that behaves like an expert for some narrow application domain | •	When you have a lot of experience exploring the space, know what to do for many different scenarios, and can express what to do as rules or strategies. <br/>	•	When you have many constraints that must be obeyed. <br/>• When you need to explain your decisions, but you don't have a mathematical model that you trust enough to calculate actions. | •	Are limited by knowledge from previous exploration. <br/>• Maintaining the rules and all the exceptions in the knowledge base is tedious and error prone. |
