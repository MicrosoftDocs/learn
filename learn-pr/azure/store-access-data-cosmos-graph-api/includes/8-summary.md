In this module, you learned about Graph Databases and their uses, and how to create an application that uses Azure Cosmos DB as a graph database. You also learned how to store, retrieve, and manipulate graph data, and visualize it using the Data Explorer in the Azure portal.

You've learned how to:

- Determine if a graph database fits the data needs of your application
- Store data in a graph database from an application using the Gremlin API
- Query data in a graph database from an application using the Gremlin API
