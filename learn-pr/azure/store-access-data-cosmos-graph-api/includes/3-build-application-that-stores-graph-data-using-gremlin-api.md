If you have chosen to create a graph database, your developers will need to know how to write code against that database.

Suppose your team has decided to build a graph database in your e-commerce company. You want to understand how to build and maintain that database.

## Build an application that stores graph data using the Gremlin API

To build a graph database, we use a similar methodology to relational databases: we create a database and then run queries against it. For this application, there are no libraries or concepts that are specific to Azure Cosmos DB. The graph API presented by Azure Cosmos DB is entirely standards-based.

Azure Cosmos DB is the globally distributed, multi-model database service from Microsoft for mission-critical applications. It's a multi-model database that supports document, key-value, graph, and columnar data models. The Azure Cosmos DB Gremlin API is used to store and operate on graph data. Gremlin API supports modeling graph data and provides APIs to traverse through the graph data.

Azure Cosmos DB is a fully managed graph database that offers global distribution, elastic scaling of storage and throughput, automatic indexing and query, tunable consistency levels, and support for the TinkerPop standard.

### What is the Gremlin Graph Traversal Language?

The Gremlin Graph Traversal Language, or *Gremlin* is a high-performance language used to traverse and query data from graph databases. It's described as a functional, data-flow language that enables users to express complex traversals for their application's property graph.
