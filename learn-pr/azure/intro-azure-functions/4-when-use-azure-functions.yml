quiz:
  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
    - content: "When should you use Azure Functions?"
      choices:
        - content: "To host my Web API."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect! Even though you could build a Web API with Azure Functions and host it, you're most likely looking for something like App Service. Azure Functions makes use of event-based triggers, and the code only runs when a condition is met."
        - content: "To run long batch jobs (greater than 30 minutes)."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect! Azure Functions is meant to execute the code for a shorter period of time (less than 10 minutes). Longer jobs could be split up in smaller parts and use Durable Functions but generally there are better choices than Azure Functions for this use case."
        - content: "To run code that needs to run for a reason."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct! Azure Functions is event based and the code runs for a reason, when a certain condition is met."
