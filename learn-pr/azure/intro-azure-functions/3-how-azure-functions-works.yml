quiz:
  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
    - content: "Which of the following isn't a good case for using Azure functions?"
      choices:
        - content: "A new customer signed up"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect! Because the flow that happens is seldom and has a clear reason why code should run. This is a great use case for Azure Functions."
        - content: "Fetching product data from a database"
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct! Fetching products from a database is something that's likely to happen quite a lot in an e-commerce app. You could implement such an endpoint in Azure Functions, but given its cost model you're more likely better off using something like App Service."
        - content: "Processing real-time messages"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect! Combined with SignalR it can provide messages as they arrive. This is a great use case for using Azure Functions as it has a clear reason for when code should run."
