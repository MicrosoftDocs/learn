Azure Functions is a serverless solution that allows you to write less code, maintain less infrastructure, and save on costs. Instead of worrying about deploying and maintaining servers, the cloud infrastructure provides all the up-to-date resources needed to keep your applications running.

## Features

- **Use your preferred language**: Write functions in C#, Java, JavaScript, PowerShell, or Python, or use a custom handler to use virtually any other language.

- **Automate deployment**: From a tools-based approach to using external pipelines, there's a myriad of deployment options available.

- **Troubleshoot a function**: Use monitoring tools and testing strategies to gain insights into your apps.

- **Flexible pricing options**: With the Consumption plan, you only pay while your functions are running, while the Premium and App Service plans offer features for specialized needs.

## Scenario

You own a business, and you want to send a holiday greeting email to your customers. Instead of building a website and deploying and hosting it, just for one feature, you can use an Azure function, add your email sign-in details in the function and then deploy it to Azure. The functions connect to the data source, get customers emails, and send them an email on a scheduled date and time.
