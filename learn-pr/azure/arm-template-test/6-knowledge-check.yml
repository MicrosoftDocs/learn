  questions:
  - content: "Which of these problems will the ARM-TTK find?"
    choices:
    - content: A parameter in your template isn't being used.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. The ARM-TTK detects unused parameters.
    - content: The name you've chosen for a storage account has already been taken.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. The ARM-TTK doesn't validate whether resource names are already taken. Validating your deployment, or running the what-if command, will identify these issues.
    - content: A resource will be deleted if you run the deployment in complete mode.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. The what-if operation detects changes to resources, including resources that will be deleted.
  - content: "How would you run a single test by using the test toolkit?"
    choices:
    - content: "Use the parameter `-TestName` and specify the test name with double quotation marks: \"Template Should Not Contain Blanks\"."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The parameter is called `-Test`."
    - content: "Use the parameter `-Test` and specify the test as number between 1 and *n*, where *n* is the number of tests."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. You can't use a number."    
    - content: "Use the parameter `-Test` and specify the test name with double quotation marks: \"Template Should Not Contain Blanks\"."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The answer is correct."
    - content: "Use the `-Run-Only` parameter and specify which test with double quotation marks."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The parameter is called `-Test`."

      You are asked to create a new test for the ARM-TTK to detect whenever an API version is older than a specified value.
      Which of these helper cmdlets can you use to inspect the resource definitions?
    choices:
    - content: "`Test-AzTemplate`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. The `Test-AzTemplate` cmdlet executes the ARM-TTK tests, but you don't use it to inspect resource definitions within your own custom tests.
    - content: "`Find-JsonContent`"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. You can use the `Find-JsonContent` cmdlet to search for attributes within the resource definition, including the `apiVersion`.
    - content: "`Inspect-AzResourceDefinition`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. This isn't a real helper cmdlet.
