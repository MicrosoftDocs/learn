    - content: "Consider the example from the unit where the Azure VM public IP address is 174.17.218.16 and the Azure VM private IP address is 10.0.0.2. When you use virtual network rules to configure network access to Azure SQL Database, what will be returned from `SELECT client_net_address FROM sys.dm_exec_connections WHERE session_id=@@SPID;`?"
      choices:
      - content: "174.17.218.16"

        explanation: "This will be returned if virtual network rules or private endpoints are enabled."
      - content: "Both IP addresses"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Only one IP address will be returned."
      - content: "Neither IP address"
