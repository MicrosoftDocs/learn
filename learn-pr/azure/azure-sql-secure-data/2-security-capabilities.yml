    - content: "Consider the example from the unit where the public IP address of the Azure virtual machine (VM) is 203.0.113.1 and the private IP address of the Azure VM is 10.0.0.2. When you use virtual network rules to configure network access to Azure SQL Database, what is returned from `SELECT client_net_address FROM sys.dm_exec_connections WHERE session_id=@@SPID;`?"
      choices:
      - content: "203.0.113.1"
        isCorrect: false

      - content: "10.0.0.2"
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "This IP address is returned if virtual network rules or private endpoints are enabled."
