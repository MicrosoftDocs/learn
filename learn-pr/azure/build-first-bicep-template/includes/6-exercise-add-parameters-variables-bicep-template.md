In this exercise, you'll update the Bicep template you previously created so it:\

- Accepts parameters for the resource locations and names.
- Uses your business rules to select the right SKUs for the resources being deployed.

During the process, you'll:

> [!div class="checklist"]
>
> - Update the template to include a `location` parameter.
> - Update the template to include parameters and variables for the resource names.
> - Use expressions to set default values for the parameters.
> - Update the template to include variables for the SKU of each resource.
> - Test the deployment to ensure that the template is valid.

## Add the location and resource name parameters

1. In the _main.bicep_ file in Visual Studio Code, add the following code to the top of the file:

   :::code language="bicep" source="code/6-template-1.bicep" range="1-5":::

   The Bicep linter adds yellow squiggly lines underneath each parameter and variable name to indicate they're not used in the template. You'll fix this issue soon.

   Notice that you're using expressions that include string interpolation and the `uniqueString()` function to define default parameter values. Someone deploying this template can override the default parameter values by specifying the values at deployment time, but they can't override the variable values.

   Also notice that you're using a variable for the Azure App Service plan name, but you're using parameters for the other names. Storage accounts and App Service apps need globally unique names, but App Service plan names need to be unique only within their resource group. This difference means it's not a concern to use the same App Service plan name across different deployments, as long as the deployments are all going into different resource groups.

1. Find the places within the resource definitions where the `location` and `name` properties are set, and update them to use the parameter values. After you're finished, the resource definitions within your Bicep file should look like this:

   :::code language="bicep" source="code/6-template-1.bicep" range="7-34" highlight="2-3, 14-15, 22-23":::

1. Save the changes to the file.

## Automatically set the SKUs for each environment type

1. In the _main.bicep_ file in Visual Studio Code, add the following Bicep parameter below the parameters that you created in the previous task:

   :::code language="bicep" source="code/6-template-2.bicep" range="5-9":::

   Notice that you're defining a parameter with a set of allowed values, but you're not specifying a default value for this parameter.

1. Below the line that declares the `appServicePlanName` variable, add the following variable definitions:

   :::code language="bicep" source="code/6-template-2.bicep" range="12-13" :::

   Notice that you're setting these variables values by using the ternary operator to express some `if/then/else` logic.

1. Find the places within the resource definitions where the `sku` properties are set and update them to use the parameter values. After you're finished, the resource definitions in your Bicep file should look like this:

   :::code language="bicep" source="code/6-template-2.bicep" range="15-42" highlight="5, 17":::

   Notice that you haven't parameterized everything. You've set some properties right in the resource definitions, where you know these values aren't going to change between deployments.

1. Save the changes to the file.

## Verify your Bicep file

After you've completed all of the preceding changes, your _main.bicep_ file should look like this example:

:::code language="bicep" source="code/6-template-2.bicep" :::

If your file doesn't match, copy the example or adjust your file to match the example.

### Deploy the updated Bicep template

::: zone pivot="cli"

Run the following Azure CLI command in the terminal.

```azurecli
az deployment group create \
  --name main \
  --template-file main.bicep \
  --parameters environmentType=nonprod
```

::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="powershell"

Run the following Azure PowerShell command in the terminal.

```azurepowershell
New-AzResourceGroupDeployment `
  -Name main `
  -TemplateFile main.bicep `
  -environmentType nonprod
```

::: zone-end

Notice that you're explicitly specifying the value for the `environmentType` parameter when you execute the deployment. You don't need to specify the other parameter values, because they have valid default values.

### Check your deployment

1. In your browser, go back to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com?azure-portal=true) and go to your resource group. You'll still see one successful deployment, because the deployment used the same name as the first deployment.

1. Select the **1 Succeeded** link.

1. Select the deployment called **main**, and then select **Deployment details** to expand the list of deployed resources.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/6-addparams-details.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Azure portal interface for the specific deployment, with storage account and App Service resources listed with generated names." border="true":::

1. Notice that a new App Service app and storage account have been deployed with randomly generated names.
