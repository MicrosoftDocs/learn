quiz:
  questions:
  - content: "How does Azure Firewall protect network traffic for Azure Virtual Desktop?"
    choices:
    - content: "Only allows network traffic that's routed to the Azure Virtual Desktop service."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Route network traffic to Azure Firewall and create firewall rules to allow the appropriate network traffic for Azure Virtual Desktop."
    - content: "Denies all network traffic to the internet."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. If all outbound network traffic is denied, then Azure Virtual Desktop won't work."
    - content: "Denies all network traffic routed to the firewall except traffic explicitly allowed with firewall rules or policies."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Create firewall rules to allow network traffic that's required for the Azure Virtual Desktop deployment."
  - content: "What's one firewall application rule that's required for Azure Virtual Desktop to work?"
    choices:
    - content: "A rule that allows network traffic from the host pool virtual network to the Azure Virtual Desktop service."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Use the FQDN tag 'WindowsVirtualDesktop' to allow traffic from the host pool virtual network to the service."
    - content: "A rule to allow access to the host pool virtual network from storage and service bus accounts"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Create a rule to allow access from the host pool virtual network to the set of storage and service bus accounts used by the host pool."
    - content: "A rule to allow traffic from the Windows activation service to the host pool virtual network."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Create a firewall network rule to allow traffic from the host pool virtual network to the Windows activation service."
  - content: "Before someone deploys Azure Firewall, what must they set up in Azure?"
    choices:
    - content: "Peering between the virtual networks for the firewall and the workload."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Peering can be done after deploying the firewall. But virtual networks must be peered before routing all traffic through the firewall."
    - content: "A virtual network with a subnet named 'AzureFirewallSubnet'."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Deploy Azure Firewall to a virtual network that has a subnet named 'AzureFirewallSubnet'."
    - content: "A default route to send all traffic to a firewall."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. After you deploy Azure Firewall, route all network traffic for the workload's virtual network to the firewall."
