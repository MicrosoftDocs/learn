You're the subscription owner for the marketing department at your company. Some resources created for development work were put into the same resource group as a production website. Your department recently had an incident where someone deleted a resource group that they thought was used only for development resources. However, the person inadvertently deleted some production resources in that resource group. You now need to move development resources out of the resource group that has the production resources.

In this module, you identify incorrectly assigned resources in Azure, assess whether resources can be moved, and validate a resource move operation. Finally, you move and verify resources between Azure resource groups.

## Learning objectives

- Identify whether you can move resources.
- Move resources to another resource group.

## Prerequisites

- Familiarity with Azure resource groups.
