In Azure Network Watcher, metrics and logs can diagnose complex configuration issues.

Suppose you have two virtual machines (VMs) that can't communicate. You want to obtain as much information as you can to diagnose the problem.

In this unit, you troubleshoot by using Network Watcher metrics and logs. To diagnose the connectivity issue between the two VMs, you then use the network security group (NSG) flow logs.

## Register the Microsoft.Insights provider

NSG flow logging requires the *Microsoft.Insights* provider. To register for the Microsoft.Insights provider, complete the following steps.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com?azure-portal=true), and sign in to the directory with access to the subscription you created resources in.

1. In theâ€¯Azure portal, search for, select **Subscriptions**, and then select your subscription. The **Subscription** pane appears.

1. In the Subscription menu, under **Settings**, select **Resource providers**. Your subscription's **Resource providers** pane appears.

1. In the filter bar, enter **microsoft.insights**.

1. If the status of the **microsoft.insights** provider is **NotRegistered**, select **Register** in the command bar.

## Create a storage account

Now, create a storage account for the NSG flow logs.

1. On the Azure portal menu or from the **Home** page, select **Create a resource**. 

1. On the resource menu, select **Storage**, then search for and select **Storage account**. The **Storage account** pane appears.

1. Select **Create**. The **Create storage account** pane appears.

1. On the **Basics** tab, enter the following values for each setting.

    | Setting | Value |
    | --- | --- |
    | **Project details** |
    | Subscription | Select your subscription |
    | Resource group | Select your resource group |
    | **Instance details** |
    | Storage account name | Create a unique name |
    | Region | Select the same region as your resource group |

1. Select **Next: Advanced** tab, and ensure that the following value is set.

    | Setting | Value |
    | --- | --- |
    | **Blob storage** |
    | Access tier | Hot (default) |

1. Select **Review + create**, and when validation passes, select **Create**.

## Create a Log Analytics workspace

To view the NSG flow logs, use Log Analytics.

1. On the Azure portal menu or from the **Home** page, search for and select **Log Analytics workspaces**. The **Log Analytics workspaces** pane appears.

1. In the command bar, select **Create**. The **Create Log Analytics workspace** pane appears.

1. On the **Basics** tab, enter the following values for each setting.

    | Setting | Value |
    | --- | --- |
    | **Project details** |
    | Subscription | Select your subscription |
    | Resource group | Select your resource group |
    | **Instance details** |
    | Name | `testsworkspace` |
    | Region | Select the same region as your resource group |

1. Select **Review + Create**, and after validation passes, select **Create**.

## Enable flow logs

To set up flow logs, you must configure the NSG to connect to the storage account, and add traffic analytics for the NSG.

1. On the Azure portal menu, select **All resources**. Then, select the **MyNsg** network security group.

1. In the MyNsg menu, under **Monitoring**, select **NSG flow logs**. The **MyNsg | NSG flow logs** pane appears.

1. Select **Create**. The **Create a flow log** pane appears. 

1. On the **Basics** tab, select or enter the following values.

    | Setting | Value |
    | --- | --- |
    | **Project details**  |
    | Subscription | Select your subscription from the dropdown list. |
    | + Select Resource| On the **Select network security group** pane, search for and select MyNsg and **Confirm selection**. |
    | **Instance details**  |
    | Subscription | Select your subscription from the dropdown list. |
    | Storage Accounts | Select your unique storage account name.  |
    | Retention (days) | 1 |

1. Select **Next: Analytics**, then select or enter the following values.

    | Setting | Value |
    | --- | --- |
    | Flow Logs Version | Version 2 |
    | Traffic Analytics | Enable Traffic Analytics is checked. |
    | Traffic Analytics processing interval | Every 10 mins |
    | Subscription | Select your subscription from the dropdown list. |
    | Log Analytics Workspace | Select `testworkspace` from the dropdown list. |

1. Select **Review + create**.

1. Select **Create**.

1. When the deployment is complete, select **Go to resource**.

## Generate test traffic

Now, you're ready to generate some network traffic between VMs to catch in the flow log.

1. On the resource menu, select **All resources**, then select **FrontendVM**.

1. From the command bar, select **Connect**, then select **RDP**, and then select **Download RDP File**. If you see a warning about the publisher of the remote connection, select **Connect**.

1. Launch the **FrontendVM.rdp** file and select **Connect**.

1. When asked for your credentials, select **More choices**. Sign in with the username **azureuser** and the password you specified when you created the VM.

1. When asked for a security certificate, select **Yes**.

1. In the RDP session, if prompted, allow your device to be discoverable ONLY if on a private network.

1. Open a PowerShell prompt and run the following command.

    ```PowerShell
    Test-NetConnection 10.10.2.4 -port 80
    ```

The TCP connection test fails after a few seconds.

## Diagnose the problem

Now, let's use log analytics to view the NSG flow logs.

1. On the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/learn.docs.microsoft.com?azure-portal=true) resource menu, select **All services**, select **Networking**, and then select **Network Watcher**. The **Network Watcher** pane appears.

1. In the resource menu, under **Logs**, select **Traffic Analytics**. The **Network Watcher | Traffic Analytics** pane appears.

1. In the **FlowLog Subscriptions** dropdown list, select your subscription.

1. In the **Log Analytics workspace** dropdown list, select `testworkspace`.

1. Use the different views to diagnose the problem that prevents communication from the frontend VM to the backend VM.

## Fix the problem

An NSG rule is blocking inbound traffic to the backend subnet from everywhere over the ports 80, 443, and 3389 instead of just blocking inbound traffic from the Internet. Let's reconfigure that rule now.

1. On the Azure portal resource menu, select **All resources**, and then select **MyNsg** from the list.

1. In the MyNsg menu, under **Settings**, select **Inbound security rules**, and then select **MyNSGRule**. The **MyNSGRule** pane appears.

1. In the **Source** dropdown list, select **Service Tag**, and in the **Source service tag** dropdown list, select **Internet**.

1. In the MyNSGRule command bar, select **Save** to update the security rule.

## Retest the connection

Connections on port 80 should now work without problems.

1. In the RDP client, connect to **FrontendVM**. At the PowerShell prompt, run the following command.

    ```PowerShell
    Test-NetConnection 10.10.2.4 -port 80
    ```

The connection test should now succeed.
