quiz:
  questions:
  - content: "If both Windows and Linux machines are accessing an Azure NetApp Files volume, which is the best file protocol option to assign to the volume?"
    choices:
    - content: "NFSv4"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While Linux machines can readily access Azure NetApp Files volumes that use only the NFSv4 protocol, mounting NFS volumes in Windows is a complex task."
    - content: "SMB3"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Windows machines can only access Azure NetApp Files volumes that use the SMB3 protocol. However, mounting SMB volumes in Linux requires more configuration."
    - content: "NFSv3 and SMB3"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Azure NetApp Files supports creating volumes that use NFSv3 and SMB3 simultaneously. This capability enables both Linux and Windows machines to mount the volume without extra configuration."
  - content: "An enterprise app requires 128 MiB/s throughput and a 2-TiB volume size. Which Azure NetApp Files service tier should be selected when creating the capacity pool, assuming the pool uses automatic QoS?"
    choices:
    - content: "Premium"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The Premium tier provides up to 64 MiB/s of throughput per 1 TiB of capacity provisioned, so provisioning 2 TiB for the volume provides up to 128 MiB/s throughput."
    - content: "Ultra"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The Ultra tier provides up to 128 MiB/s of throughput per 1 TiB of capacity provisioned. So, provisioning 2 TiB for the volume provides up to 256 MiB/s throughput, which is more than the requirement."
    - content: "Standard"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The Standard tier provides up to 16 MiB/s of throughput per 1 TiB of capacity provisioned. So, provisioning 2 TiB for the volume provides up to 32 MiB/s throughput, which is less than the requirement."
  - content: "Suppose a VDI administrator who is responsible for thousands of virtual desktops is working on an infrastructure. A key consideration for the infrastructure is the capability to roll back any user profile to an earlier configuration. This capability is useful for troubleshooting. The infrastructure must also have the capability of reverting an entire volume to an earlier state, which can help the company recover from a ransomware attack. Which of the following Azure NetApp Files features provides the required capabilities?"
    choices:
    - content: "Quality of Service"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Quality of Service is a method for assigning throughput to a capacity pool (Auto or Manual). You can't use this setting to revert Azure NetApp Files data to an earlier state."
    - content: "NetApp Cloud Sync"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. NetApp Cloud Sync is a third-party service for transferring NAS data between on-premises and cloud storage. You can't use this service to revert Azure NetApp Files data to an earlier state."
    - content: "Snapshots"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. A snapshot is a point-in-time image of a volume that enables you to roll back files and directories to an earlier state and to revert the entire volume to an earlier configuration."
  - content: "Suppose an IT administrator has been asked to research the viability of moving the company's enterprise apps to Azure, and using Azure NetApp Files for the apps' shared storage. The main constraint they face is a minimal budget to perform the actual migration. Because of this constraint, the migration must be performed with little or no modifications to the app code, data, or configuration. Which of the following options best describes this type of migration?"
    choices:
    - content: "Low latency"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Latency is the time required to access a particular storage location and has nothing to do with migrating workloads to the cloud."
    - content: "Lift and shift"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. A lift-and-shift migration is one where you transition your workload into the cloud without having to change the components, configuration, or code of your application."
    - content: "Subnet delegation"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A delegated subnet is a subnet configured with permissions to create resources that are specific to a service, such as Azure NetApp Files."
  - content: "Suppose an administrator is evaluating Azure NetApp Files as a shared storage solution. Which of the following options best describes a scenario where they would counsel against using Azure NetApp Files?"
    choices:
    - content: "A small-scale, low-performance workload that consists mostly of static content with relatively constant demand"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Azure NetApp Files isn't ideal for small, static workloads. Azure NetApp Files is best used with large-scale, high-performance workloads with elastic content and demand."
    - content: "A high-performance computing simulation application that requires high IOPS and low latency"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Azure NetApp Files supports up to 450,000 IOPS and submillisecond latency, so it's ideal for this type of application."
    - content: "A massive Microsoft SQL Server deployment"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The high throughput and low latency offered by Azure NetApp Files makes it well-suited as a shared storage container for even the largest databases."
