quiz:
  questions:
  - content: "If both Windows and Linux machines are accessing an Azure NetApp Files volume, which is the best file protocol option to assign to the volume?"
    choices:
    - content: "NFSv4.1"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Although Linux machines can readily access Azure NetApp Files volumes that use only the NFSv4.1 protocol, mounting NFS volumes in Windows is a complex task."
    - content: "SMB3"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Although Windows machines can readily access Azure NetApp Files volumes that use only the SMB3 protocol, mounting SMB volumes in Linux is a complex task."
    - content: "NFSv3 and SMB3"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Azure NetApp Files supports creating volumes that use NFSv3 and SMB3 simultaneously."
  - content: "An enterprise app requires 128 MiB/s throughput and a 2-TiB volume size. Which Azure NetApp Files service tier should be selected when creating the capacity pool, assuming the pool uses automatic QoS?"
    choices:
    - content: "Premium"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The Premium tier provides up to 64 MiB/s of throughput per 1 TiB of capacity provisioned, so provisioning 2 TiB for the volume provides up to 128 MiB/s throughput."
    - content: "Ultra"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The Ultra tier provides up to 128 MiB/s of throughput per 1 TiB of capacity provisioned. So, provisioning 2 TiB for the volume provides up to 256 MiB/s throughput, which is more than the requirement."
    - content: "Standard"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The Standard tier provides 16 MiB/s per 1 TiB of capacity provisioned, which in this case would only yield 32 MiB/s throughput."
  - content: "Which of the following options is a true statement about Azure NetApp Files volumes?"
    choices:
    - content: "The minimum volume size is 50 TiB for regular volumes."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. For regular Azure NetApp Files volumes, the minimum volume size is 100 GiB and the maximum size is 100 TiB. Azure NetApp Files supports large volumes up to 500 TiB in size."
    - content: "Each volume can belong to multiple capacity pools."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Azure NetApp Files volumes are accessible only within your virtual private network."
    - content: "Snapshots"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Azure NetApp Files doesn't provide a publicly (i.e. internet) accessible endpoint."
