By implementing effective FinOps management strategies, organizations can fully unlock the potential of their cloud investments and attain greater success in the cloud. To achieve this goal, organizations should apply a range of capabilities, including FinOps practice operations, FinOps tooling and services, FinOps assessment, onboarding workloads, FinOps education and enablement, Invoicing and chargeback, Cloud policy and governance, and Intersecting disciplines.

## FinOps practice operations

**Objective:**  Driving a culture of accountability through effective organizational alignment of the FinOps practice and empowering the FinOps function within teams.

## Onboarding workloads

**Objective:**  Developing a cloud front door process to onboard brownfield and greenfield applications through financial viability and technical feasibility assessment criteria that support operational objectives, while also maintaining effective cost management.

## FinOps education & enablement

**Objective:**  Training, skill development, and operational activities that enable teams throughout the organization to adopt and deliver the FinOps practice.

## Invoicing & chargeback

**Objective:**  Developing specific reporting, reconciliation workflows, and chargeback models, in collaboration with the finance team, to align Cloud Service Provider (CSP) invoices with billing data for attributing cloud costs back to specific budgets within an organization.

## Cloud policy & governance

**Objective:**  Establishing and evolving policies, controls, and governance mechanisms to ensure that cloud use aligns with business objectives, complies with regulatory requirements, and optimizes cloud resources efficiently.

## Intersecting disciplines

Examples include ITAM, ITFM, TBM, Security, and Sustainability.

## FinOps tooling & services

**Objective:**  Developing criteria and methodology to capture proof-of-value for effectively selecting FinOps tools and services that align to the Framework Capabilities to empower the FinOps practice.
