Understanding cloud usage and costs is important for effective cloud management and optimization. Gaining this understanding allows organizations to gain insight into how resources are being utilized, identify trends, and make informed decisions to optimize performance and cost efficiency. Data ingestion, allocation, reporting and analytics, and anomaly management play crucial roles in achieving this objective.

## Data ingestion

#### Objective:

Collect, transfer, and normalize data from various sources for analysis, with a focus on understanding the usage and costs associated with an organization's cloud infrastructure.

## Allocation

#### Objective:

Define strategies to assign and split shared cloud costs using accounts, tags, labels, and other metadata, creating accountability among teams and projects within an organization.

#### Get started with cost allocation:
