In this module, you've seen how security can be applied against the database. Remember, any one security vulnerability still makes your database vulnerable. It's important to make sure you have everything possible to reduce threats to your database.

You've learned how to:

- Configure the firewall for the Azure SQL Server database
- Control user access at the database and Active Directory levels
- Manage encryption between the client and server
- Add auditing and threat monitoring to the Azure SQL Server database

All of the aspects work together to secure your database. Your customers are important, your reputation is important, and that makes your database security important.
