You need to understand and [define your motivations](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/strategy/motivations) for your cloud adoption strategy. Clear motivations help prioritize initiatives, streamline resource allocation, and mitigate risks by addressing specific business needs. 

You can achieve motivations for cloud adoption directly, such as through cost optimization by moving to platform as a service (PaaS), or indirectly, such as accelerating business application delivery.

## Define your motivations

Determine your motivations for adopting and expanding your cloud footprint. To guide your decision making and inform your strategy, consider the following examples.

### Reduce business risk  

- **Security:** Use advanced security offerings to protect your assets.

- **Sustainability:** Achieve carbon savings and enhance green IT compliance.

- **Resiliency:** Increase redundancy and resilience through cloud capabilities, including multiregion deployments.

- **Business continuity:** Use the capabilities of the cloud for high availability and uptime guarantees. To establish disaster recovery routines, use reliable backup and recovery solutions.

- **Datacenter modernization:** Reduce hardware and staffing, and get enhanced capabilities.

- **Data governance:** Implement robust data governance to minimize risks and help ensure compliance and security across decentralized data sources.

- **Compliance management:** Minimize compliance risks by using policies that block or alert deployments that don't align with your compliance requirements.  

- **Financial transparency:** Gain visibility into financial aspects of cloud investments for leadership teams, including detailed billing and usage reports.

- **Cloud scale:** Use the cloud's built-in redundancy and disaster recovery capabilities to help ensure business continuity and mitigate operational risks.

### Accelerate innovation  

- **AI:** Access cutting-edge AI capabilities for transformative solutions.

- **Cloud-native capabilities:** Benefit from exclusive cloud capabilities that aren't available in on-premises environments.

- **Security:** Use robust security controls to securely enhance innovation.

- **Customer solutions:** Develop software as a service (SaaS) offerings and consumer apps efficiently.

- **Shared responsibility:** Focus IT efforts on delivering business value.

- **Data empowerment:** Use accessible data to democratize insights and drive rapid, data-driven innovation across teams.

- **Compliance empowerment:** Apply policies to make compliance a feature of the solutions that you develop instead of an assessment that they need to pass later.

- **Cost flexibility:** Use the pay-as-you-go cost model to easily drive short-term innovative projects and proof-of-concept solutions without the need to own any resources when you shut them down.

### Enhance agility and efficiency

- **Profitability improvement potential:** Accelerate business growth and optimize investments by using operational efficiency opportunities, cloud innovation, enhanced security, flexibility, and scalability.

- **Multicloud opportunities:** Integrate Azure to support multicloud strategies.

- **Rapid prototyping:** Quickly prototype and access services like AI and robotic process automation.

- **Simplified operations:** Use consistent tooling and platforms across your workloads to improve visibility and enable collaborative work across technical disciplines.

- **Decoupled data services:** Use decoupled data services so that your services are independent and scalable. These services separate application architecture from data dependencies and enable agility in application development.

- **Cloud scale:** Use modern capabilities to scale up and down according to your business requirements.

- **Software-defined compliance:** Incorporate infrastructure as code (IaC) and software-based policy controls to more easily adjust to regulation changes.

## Classify motivations

After you identify your motivations and key considerations, assess and prioritize your needs. Follow these steps when you document your motivations:

- **Assess needs:** Identify which motivations align with your organization's strategic goals.

- **Prioritize:** Define the priority and urgency for each item in each motivation.

- **Iterate and review:** Revisit and adjust priorities regularly as the business needs change. When you later define your mission and goals, link them to your motivations and expand as necessary.

The Strategy methodology provides an [example of motivation classification](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/strategy/motivations#example-classification). Use this example to discover ideas about how to incorporate this guidance into your scenario.
