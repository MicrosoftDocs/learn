## Apply responsible and trust AI principles

The six key principles for responsible AI at Microsoft include fairness, reliability and safety, privacy and security, inclusiveness, transparency, and accountability. Apply these principles to help ensure that your AI is responsible and trustworthy as you integrate it into mainstream products and services throughout your AI adoption.

### Responsible AI principles

- **Fairness:** AI should treat everyone equally and avoid discrimination.

- **Reliability and safety:** AI must operate reliably, consistently, and safely to build trust.
- **Privacy and security:** AI should protect confidential information and resist attacks.
- **Inclusiveness:** AI should engage everyone and address exclusion barriers.
- **Transparency:** AI should be understandable and transparent because it can inform important and sensitive decision-making for individuals.
- **Accountability:** AI systems and developers should be accountable for their actions.

### The importance of responsible AI

Educate your leadership, decision makers, and the rest of your organization about the importance of responsible AI.

Incorporate responsible AI to help mitigate the following risks:

- **Unintended consequences:** Plan and oversee your responsible AI implementation to reduce the risk of unforeseen effects that have ethical implications.

- **Evolving threats:** Stay ahead of newly emerging threats as AI technology evolves.
- **Bias:** Mitigate bias to help ensure that AI systems are fair and impartial.
- **Sensitive technologies:** Responsibly use sensitive technologies, such as facial recognition, because of their risk to fundamental freedoms and human rights.
