First, you should [assess your existing cloud strategy](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/strategy/assessment). Use the feedback from your assessment to determine your current cloud maturity, identify gaps in your strategy, and take action to improve.

Follow these steps to assess and document your cloud adoption maturity:

1. **Assess maturity:** Take the [Cloud Adoption Strategy Evaluator assessment](/assessments/8fefc6d5-97ac-42b3-8e97-d82701e55bab/).

1. **Identify gaps:** Discover gaps that you might have in your current cloud adoption strategy and document them.
1. **Get guidance:** Define action points based on the gaps that you identify. Educate your business about potential action points and information that you must implement in your new or updated cloud strategy. Use guidance from the assessment to help you address gaps.
1. **Iterate plans:** Do this assessment iteratively as your cloud adoption strategy matures. Iterate and refine as necessary across the lifecycle of your cloud footprint.
