[Sustainability](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/strategy/inform/sustainability) is an increasingly important KPI for organizations. Organizations must respond to this evolution with innovative solutions and technology-enabled approaches.

Research indicates that this evolution is good for business because sustainability front-runners:

- Have a lower cost of capital.
- Deliver superior equity market returns.
- Can access new markets more easily by creating new types of products and services.
- Are better at managing risk and ensuring more resilient operations.

> [!NOTE]
> When you transition workloads to Microsoft Azure, you can run solutions that are **up to 98%** more carbon efficient and **up to 93%** more energy efficient than on-premises options, depending on specific server usage, renewable energy purchases, and other factors.

## Make sustainability a part of your organization's brand

Customers demand transparency about the environmental impact of organizations. Proactively work toward sustainability to build a positive brand, reputation, and trust, and attract new talent, partners, and investors. To strengthen your business messaging, communicate details about your sustainability efforts to customers. Adopt a green business model to ensure long-term success and attract employees that have a similar green mindset.

#### Recommendations

- **Integrate sustainability into your mission statement** and align brand values with business practices.

- **Share annual sustainability reports** to demonstrate transparency and progress. For more information, see the [Microsoft 2024 environmental sustainability report](https://www.microsoft.com/corporate-responsibility/sustainability/report).

## Incorporate sustainability into your cloud strategy

The cloud can benefit your sustainability efforts in the following ways:

- Meet regulatory compliance requirements.
- Help your organization reduce carbon emissions by using modern cloud tools.
- Use resources more efficiently.
- Reduce your environmental footprint by migrating from on-premises to cloud datacenters.
- Increase revenue by optimizing your technical landscape.
- Reduce operating costs by driving efficiency.
- Improve brand trust by driving sustainability and green IT practices.
- Achieve sustainable outcomes by combining financial efficiency and cost optimization.

#### Recommendations

- **Create green teams** that have goals and metrics for sustainability, including emissions, water use, and energy consumption.

- **Evaluate your supply chain** for Scope 3 emissions, and understand the factors that contribute to your emissions. 
- **Educate teams** by using the Azure Well-Architected Framework for sustainable practices.
- **Use gamification** to motivate sustainable solutions, and track progress with metrics like the Software Carbon Intensity (SCI) specification.
- **Incorporate AI** to accelerate sustainability efforts. For more information, see [Accelerate sustainability with AI](https://cdn-dynmedia-1.microsoft.com/is/content/microsoftcorp/microsoft/msc/documents/presentations/CSR/Accelerating-Sustainability-with-AI-2025.pdf).
