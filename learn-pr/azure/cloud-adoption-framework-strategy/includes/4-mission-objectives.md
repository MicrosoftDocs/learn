Next, you must [define your mission and objectives](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/strategy/mission-objectives). A clear mission provides direction and purpose. The objectives outline the steps that you take to achieve that mission. A mission is only valuable if you can take action on it, achieve objectives effectively, and measure the results.

## Create a mission statement

A mission statement helps align your objectives and key results to your organization's overall business mission.

To help derive a statement for your business, consider these initial questions:

- Why are you moving to or expanding in the cloud?
- What are your business objectives?
- How do you intend to measure success?

Use the answers to these questions to help define your mission statement for your cloud strategy.

**Example mission statement:** "Use cloud technologies that align with our business and IT goals to empower our organization to innovate, scale, and deliver secure, high-quality services."

## Define objectives

Your objectives should include clear and inspiring goals that align with the mission statement. Consider the following examples:

- **Objective for security:** "Use advanced security offerings to protect your assets."

- **Objective for compliance:** "Use advanced compliance offerings to audit your assets."
- **Objective for datacenter modernization:** "Modernize infrastructure with reduced hardware and staffing. To upgrade the datacenter, migrate to Azure for enhanced capabilities."

#### Recommendations

- **Involve key stakeholders** to ensure that they understand and align with the business and departmental missions and objectives. Include problem statements that cloud adoption addresses.

- **Define cloud adoption objectives and key results clearly,** and align them with your organization's overall mission and objectives.

- **Set specific key results and key performance indicators (KPIs)** to measure progress towards objectives.

- **Assign accountable roles to key results**, and review key results and KPIs periodically, preferably at least quarterly at the strategic level.

- **Ensure that your objectives, key results, and accountability are clear, concise, accessible, and easy to understand for everyone.**

## Measure success

To understand if you're on track to meet your objectives, you must be able to effectively measure and track your key results by using KPIs or other metrics. These metrics should provide insight into your progress against each key result and highlight areas for improvement.

The Strategy methodology provides [example objectives and metrics](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/strategy/mission-objectives#example-objectives-and-success-metrics). Use these examples to discover ideas about how to incorporate this guidance into your scenario.

#### Recommendations

- **Define KPIs.** Set clear metrics that you can measure against each related key result.

- **Review regularly.** Schedule and perform regular reviews to assess progress.

- **Be agile.** Iterate and adjust your strategy and ways to measure progress. Cloud innovation rapidly changes the technical landscape and the opportunities to apply clever solutions.
