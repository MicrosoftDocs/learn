After you complete the first four steps of your strategy, you can factor in other considerations to [inform your cloud adoption strategy](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/strategy/inform/). These considerations include cost efficiency, AI, resiliency, security, and sustainability.

[Cost efficiency](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/strategy/inform/cost-efficiency) involves strategic decisions to help ensure that your organization gets the best value for your investment and minimizes unnecessary expenses.

## Shift from a CapEx model to an OpEx model

Traditionally, organizations used a CapEx model for IT budgets, which required significant upfront investment in hardware. These expenses were recorded as assets on the balance sheet.

In contrast, cloud computing shifts IT spending to an Operating Expenses (OpEx) model, which includes ongoing costs such as periodic payments for services like Azure. The charges reflect actual usage and maintenance needs rather than fixed costs. So organizations can adjust costs based on usage, which promotes financial agility and efficiency.

Consider the following factors when you shift to an OpEx model:

- **Immediate tax deductions:** To improve your cash flow, review immediate tax deductions instead of depreciation.

- **Accounting changes:** Be aware of any necessary changes in your accounting practices.
- **Maintenance contracts:** Review and adjust your maintenance contracts as needed.
- **Budget allocation:** Instead of a one-time annual budget allocation, take advantage of cloud flexibility by regularly reviewing and adjusting your budgets. This approach requires combined efforts across IT and financial teams.

#### Recommendations

- **Educate business teams and leadership about the shift** from a traditional CapEx cost structure to a more flexible OpEx pricing model. Discuss how the new model improves agility and efficiency.

- **Establish budgets for top-spending platform services** on the cloud to control costs during initial cloud adoption. This practice helps detect unanticipated changes.

- **Understand the cost-to-benefit ratio** and ensure that cloud services contribute to business objectives. Use tools like the [Azure total cost of ownership calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/tco/calculator/), the [Azure pricing calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/calculator/), and [Microsoft Cost Management](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/cost-management).

## Use the FinOps Framework to establish best practices

To implement cost efficiency in cloud adoption, you must properly manage and optimize cloud investments to maximize business value. During this process, you must:

- Gain a clear understanding of cloud usage and associated costs.
- Quantify the business value of cloud initiatives.
- Optimize spending strategically to align with organizational goals and avoid unnecessary expenditures.

Effective financial management contributes to the following benefits:
- Prevents cost overruns
- Ensures that investments contribute to business objectives
- Safeguards against inefficiencies
- Reinforces strategic alignment across teams

Embrace the FinOps Framework to foster financial responsibility that focuses on accountability and data-driven decisions. Key practices include accurate forecasting, strategic budgeting, and real-time cost tracking. The FinOps Framework encourages collaboration between finance, operations, and engineering teams for shared ownership of cloud spending and outcomes. Implement FinOps best practices to balance innovation and cost-effectiveness.
