This unit describes how to align your organization with leadership and strategy to ensure that you have the proper support for your cloud adoption.

## Get leadership and executive buy-in

Ensure that your leadership align with your motivations and business objectives. A lack of leadership buy-in can introduce significant risks.

- **Align leadership with strategic goals.** Ensure that leadership understands the benefits, challenges, and risks of your cloud adoption investments. 

- **Obtain required resources.** Secure leadership buy-in to obtain necessary resources for technology, talent, and time.
- **Communicate leadership buy-in.** Inform your organization's teams of leadership support to reduce resistance and enhance employee adaptability during digital transformation.

## Align organizational strategies

To help ensure a successful cloud adoption, align your business, digital, IT, and adoption strategies.

- The **business strategy** defines mission, goals, market positioning, and competitive approach to drive revenue growth, customer satisfaction, and cost efficiency.

- The **digital strategy** defines how technology transforms business processes, customer interactions, and offerings for digital growth and innovation.
- The **IT strategy** defines how technology infrastructure supports business goals. It focuses on operational efficiency, security, and modernization.

Ensure that your adoption strategy supports the goals of any existing organizational strategies and missions.

- **Review strategy alignment regularly.** Check in with business, digital, and IT leaders to keep cloud initiatives aligned with evolving goals.

- **Use agile feedback loops.** Use agile practices to gather feedback from stakeholders and leaders, and quickly adapt strategies to meet changing needs.

If you don't have existing strategies, you should still communicate with key stakeholders about your business, digital, and IT objectives. This alignment provides the following benefits:

- Complement technology roadmap and infrastructure modernization.

- Enable IT to support business and digital goals effectively.
- Achieve goals like agility, growth, cost efficiency, and customer satisfaction.
- Accelerate initiatives like data-driven insights, product innovation, and digital customer experiences.

## Prepare your operating model for cloud adoption

To effectively adopt the cloud, you need the right organizational resources, such as people, processes, technology, and partners. Identify your existing resources to inform your adoption strategy.

Your organization's operating model defines the structure of your organization and how that structure meets strategic objectives to provide value to your customers and stakeholders.

A full operating model represents the following elements:

- Value streams
- Capabilities
- Organizational structures
- Management systems
- Information systems
- Delivery partners and locations

Understand your existing operating model so that you can address potential limitations in the following areas:

- **Organizational capabilities and processes:** Traditional capabilities might struggle to keep up with cloud's continuous change and scale. The adoption strategy should improve these capabilities to support the cloud effectively.

- **Organizational culture:** Regulated or risk-averse organizations might resist cloud adoption because of their non-collaborative culture. The strategy should address cultural needs to enable cloud benefits.
- **Roles and skills:** On-premises organizations might lack cloud expertise. The strategy should include a training and skilling plan for cloud services adoption.

Recommendations:

- **Understand your current operating model.** Evaluate current capabilities and structures through a workshop with leadership or a non-Microsoft assessment to benchmark cloud readiness.

- **Identify gaps.** Hold a workshop with leadership to identify readiness gaps that you identify in your evaluation, and align the cloud adoption strategy with strategic objectives.
- **Inform stakeholders.** Inform and align key stakeholders on gaps and risks, and address these problems during the planning stage.
- **Continuously review.** Conduct regular benchmarks and workshops to review readiness, measure progress, and iteratively adapt your strategy.

## Shift from a project model to a product model

To ensure that you can broadly scale your cloud services at speed, you might need to shift from a traditional project delivery model to a product delivery model for operations.

- A **project model** is task-driven with a defined scope, start and end time frames, and a CAPEX-focused budget. Ownership shifts to another team post-completion for operations and maintenance.

- A **product model** is outcome-driven with continuous value delivery. Cross-functional teams take end-to-end ownership of development, operations, and governance. This approach enables responsive and scalable value delivery.

|Project delivery model|Product delivery model|
|----|----|
| The focus is to complete tasks and deliver a finished solution.| The focus is ongoing improvements and contiuous value delivery.|
|The outcome is based on a completed solution at a specific point in time.| The outcome is based on a continuously evolving service.|
|Temporary project teams have a clearly defined end date.| Permanent product teams manage the lifecycle of the service.|
|Project teams are isolated and temporary.| Cross-functional, stable product, platform, and enablement teams make up the team structure. |

A product delivery model provides the following key benefits:

- **Democratization and scalability**: A product delivery model makes cloud platform services easily consumable and accessible, which drives cloud adoption and maturity.

- **Innovation**: A product delivery model aligns with cloud-native technologies, so it's easier to experiment, scale, and roll out new features.
- **Business alignment**: A product delivery model delivers continuous value, which helps technology investments align with business goals.
- **Collaboration**: A product delivery model encourages cross-functional collaboration to drive business outcomes effectively.

A shift to the product delivery model affects your cloud adoption strategy because it redefines how you plan, implement, and maintain your cloud initiatives. This model helps ensure that cloud investments provide lasting, strategic value rather than short-term, one-off results.

Recommendations:

- **Assess current structures.** Evaluate your organization's existing operating model, including delivery functions, funding approaches, and team structures. Hold a leadership workshop to document current operations and identify potential benefits of a product model.

- **Define a target state.** After you align strategic objectives and evaluate your cloud culture and operating model, identify the target state for transformation across architecture, operations, governance, and culture. Conduct a leadership workshop to outline necessary initiatives and programs.

- **Engage stakeholders.** Ensure that key stakeholders understand and support the shift to a product delivery model, including the required cultural and operational changes.

- **Set expectations.** Communicate the cultural shift towards a product mindset. Emphasize customer-centered thinking, continuous collaboration, and outcome-focused approaches.

- **Plan resources.** Allocate sufficient time and resources for planning. Address gaps and establish a roadmap to transition from a project approach to a product approach.

## Identify and define partner relationships

You might need to rely on internal and external partners to help you implement your cloud adoption strategy and provide expertise and resources.

- **Identify key partners.** Determine key partners that can help implement your strategy, including your cloud provider and providers of critical line-of-business applications and infrastructure.

- **Promote integrated partnerships.** Treat your cloud provider and key independent software vendors as integrated partners who help deliver your strategy, rather than just suppliers.

- **Regularly meet with partners.** Establish regular meetings with stakeholders from partner organizations to discuss their contributions to key performance indicators and key results, and explore collaboration opportunities.
