  questions:
    - content: "Why should we use ConfigMaps?"
      choices:
        - content: "To decouple our configuration from our application."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "ConfigMaps allow us to make our configuration abstract and remove them from our applications."
        - content: "To map configuration so it's easily accessible."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Although the name is a map, the ConfigMap object is meant to hold chunks of configuration entirely."
        - content: "To avoid losing data."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "This is not the objective of the ConfigMaps."
    - content: "How can you use ConfigMaps in an application?"
      choices:
        - content: "Injecting them into variables or mounting them into the filesystem."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct. ConfigMaps, just like secrets, can be loaded directly into environment variables or mounted into a pod's file system."
        - content: "As an API accessed by the container inside the pod."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Containers cannot access ConfigMaps via API."
        - content: "Only through kubectl."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "ConfigMaps can be used from within the pods."
    - content: "Is the namespace a limitation for ConfigMaps?"
      choices:
        - content: "Yes, the ConfigMap and the pod that's using it need to be in the same namespace."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct. ConfigMaps are namespaced resources."
        - content: "No, ConfigMaps are cluster-wide."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "ConfigMaps cannot be accessed cluster-wide. The are created in and can only be accessed within a namespace."
        - content: "ConfigMaps are not part of any namespace."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "ConfigMaps are part of the namespace they're created in and are scoped to it."
