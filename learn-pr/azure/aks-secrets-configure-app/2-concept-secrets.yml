  questions:
    - content: "Why are Kubernetes Secrets safer than plain text values?"
      choices:
        - content: "Because they encrypt the data."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Although they encode the data in a different format, base64 encoding is not considered encryption."
        - content: "They don't let sensitive information open to all users, concealing them in a workload."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Cluster managers can restrict access to workload namespaces to only those authorized; avoiding exposing secrets unnecessarily."
        - content: "They store the information elsewhere."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "The information is still stored in the cluster."
    - content: "How can you use Secrets in an application?"
      choices:
        - content: "Injecting them into variables or mounting them into the filesystem."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct. Secrets can be loaded directly into environment variables or mounted into a pod's file system."
        - content: "As an API accessed by the container inside the pod."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Containers cannot access Secrets via API."
        - content: "Only through kubectl."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Secrets can be used from within the pods."
    - content: "How is base64 used in secrets?"
      choices:
        - content: "Secrets can be created using base64 encoding or plain text, but are always mounted as plain text."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Secrets can be created using both base64 and plain text encodings, but they're always mounted as base64."
        - content: "Secrets can only be created using base64 encoding, and are always mounted as base64 encoded."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Secrets can also be created using plain text via the `stringData` key."
        - content: "Secrets can be created using base64 encoding or plain text, but are always mounted as base64."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct; Secrets can be created using both encodings, but they'll always be mounted as base64."
