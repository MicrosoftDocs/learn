You've successfully explored and confirmed the benefits that GitHub Actions and Azure Pipelines bring into implementing cloud-native applications. You're now confident that this functionality will allow you to further enhance the agility and resiliency of your solution. It will also increase its value to customers through more frequent feature updates.

In this module, you learned about the CI/CD characteristics implemented by using GitHub Actions or Azure Pipelines. You started by using GitHub Actions to provision IaC. You then extended that scenario by incorporating into the building, testing, and deployment of containerized applications. You also implemented CI/CD for IoT Edge applications by using Azure DevOps.

Now that you've completed this module, you should be able to:

* Describe the principles of DevOps and their implementation in cloud-native application scenarios.
* Implement DevOps principles by using GitHub repositories, actions, and workflows, as well as Azure Pipelines and Azure Repos.
* Build and deploy infrastructure and applications by using GitHub workflows and Azure Pipelines.
