Immersive Reader is perfect for teaching, both in classrooms and online. It's especially helpful for students who need to learn from home, over video conferencing. Immersive Reader may help prevent students from falling behind, as it allows them to set the pace for their own learning.

## Teaching children

Students can use Immersive Reader's read aloud function and follow along to learn how to read and pronounce words at their own pace.

Students can also utilize the grammar and picture dictionary functionality to learn the meaning of words and how sentences are constructed. Providing students with the capability to learn independently might help mitigate the stigma experienced by children who are at a lower reading level, creating more confident and resilient learners.

## Online learning

It's vital that independent online learning tools, such as Code.org, deliver a good learning experience, or users are likely to abandon their courses. With Immersive Reader, Code.org can provide users with features such as line focus and read aloud – which may improve attention and comprehension, and open up learning to more users.

## Approaching learning differences

Having a learning difference shouldn't mean a subpar education. With the right tools, people with learning differences can excel in their education. Immersive Reader was created with dyslexia in mind, however, it can also help people with ADD (a subcategory of ADHD), autism, dysgraphia (writing dyslexia), and dyscalculia (math dyslexia).

For example, Immersive Reader can help people with dyslexia read by breaking words into syllables. Immersive Reader may also make math more accessible for people with dyscalculia by turning on read aloud, or help people with ADHD by turning on focus mode.

## Increasing accessibility

Immersive Reader increases accessibility for people with visual impairments or sensory processing disorders. These visual difficulties can include problems with light sensitivity, color-blindness, difficulty focusing on a line of text, poor vision, or visual fatigue, which can all make reading on a screen difficult.

With Immersive Reader, learners can adjust colors, text size, and font spacing, or listen to the text rather than read it. These accessibility features can make a significant difference in user retention and ease. What's more, being able to use focus mode, or turn on line focus, may help prevent people with processing difficulties from becoming overwhelmed and frustrated.

## New language learners

Immersive Reader has built-in instant translation between 80 languages, both for a single word or an entire document. Users can also use the picture dictionary with translation for common words, along with read aloud to learn pronunciation of words. This service opens up learning for students who are stronger in different languages. Further, built-in translation may help parents who speak different languages be more involved with their children's education.
