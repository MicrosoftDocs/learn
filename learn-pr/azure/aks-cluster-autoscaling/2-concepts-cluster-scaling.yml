  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "How is the cluster autoscaler different from the HPA?"
    choices:
    - content: "They're both the same resource with different names."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Pod autoscalers, like the HPA, are meant to live within the cluster and scale pods."
    - content: "The cluster autoscaler monitors pods to scale the number of nodes in a cluster."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The cluster autoscaler scales nodes, while the HPA scale pods."
    - content: "The HPA scales the number of pods, while the cluster autoscaler is intended for multi-cluster usage."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The cluster autoscaler works in a single cluster."

  - content: "Why is the cluster autoscaler necessary in a production environment?"
    choices:
    - content: "So you can avoid the work of manually scaling the cluster."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The cluster autoscaler is a tool that you configure to perform automatic scaling on your workloads."
    - content: "The cluster autoscaler isn't necessary in the cluster and shouldn't be used in production."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. It's a good practice to use the cluster autoscaler in production."
    - content: "The cluster autoscaler makes sure all the pods are working right."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Cluster autoscalers affect the cluster, not pods."

  - content: "In which of these situations does the cluster fail to remove a node?"
    choices:
    - content: "When a replica set manages the pod."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. All managed pods are removed."
    - content: "If there's a PDB and the PDB is too restrictive with the minimum number of pods in the cluster."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Among others, this situation is one in which the autoscaler doesn't remove a node."
    - content: "When the node runs Windows containers."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The underlying operating system isn't a factor."
