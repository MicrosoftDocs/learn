  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "How is the cluster autoscaler different from the HorizontalPodAutoscaler?"
    choices:
    - content: "None, they're both the same resource, just with different names."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Pod autoscalers are meant to live within the cluster and scale pods."
    - content: "The cluster autoscaler monitors pods in order to scale the number of nodes in a cluster."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The cluster autoscaler will scale the number of nodes, while pod autoscalers will scale pods."
    - content: "The pod autoscaler scales the number of pods, while the cluster autoscaler is intended for multi-cluster usage."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The cluster autoscaler works in a single cluster."

  - content: "Why is the cluster autoscaler necessary?"
    choices:
    - content: "To avoid the work of someone having to manually scale the cluster."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. This is the job of the cluster autoscaler."
    - content: "The cluster autoscaler is not necessary in the cluster and it should not be used in production."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. It's a good practice to use the cluster autoscaler in production."
    - content: "The cluster autoscaler makes sure all the pods are working right."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Cluster autoscalers will affect the cluster, not pods."

  - content: "In which of these situations will the cluster fail to remove a node?"
    choices:
    - content: "When a pod is managed by a replica set"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. All managed pods are removed."
    - content: "If there's a PDB and this PDB is too restrictive with the minimum number of pods in the cluster."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Among others, this is one of the situations the autoscaler won't remove a node."
    - content: "When the node runs Windows containers"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The underlying Operating System isn't a factor."
