The Azure Well-Architected Framework is a guide that helps ensure that your workload is: 

- Resilient, available, and recoverable.
- **As secure as you need it to be.**
- Worth the investment.
- Developed and operated responsibly.
- Meeting its goals on time.

A Well-Architected workload must be built with a Zero Trust approach. A secure workload is resilient to attacks and follows the security principles of confidentiality, integrity, and availability, also known as the *CIA Triad*, while meeting business goals. Any security incident can become a major breach that damages the brand and reputation of the workload or organization. To measure how secure your overall strategy is, start with these questions:

- Do your defenses make it hard and costly for attackers to compromise your system?

- Are your security measures effective in limiting the impact of an incident?
- Do you understand how valuable your system is to an attacker and the impact if it's compromised?
- Can the workload and operations quickly detect, respond to, and recover from disruptions?

The concepts described in this module aren't all-inclusive of reliability in a workload, but they represent the core principles and some of their key approaches. For a complete overview of the Well-Architected Framework pillars, check out the [Azure Well-Architected Framework](/azure/well-architected) as you start planning and designing your architecture.

Each unit in this module dives into one [design principle](/azure/well-architected/security/principles) and three approaches for that principle. You can find examples of the approaches in each unit to see how they can be applied to real-world scenarios. The examples are all based on a fictional company.

## Learning objectives

By the end of this module, you'll be more familiar with the five principles of the Security pillar and learn three approaches for each pillar. You'll learn how to:

- Create a security readiness plan that matches your business priorities.
- Handle confidentiality requirements properly.
- Strengthen your workload's integrity against security risks.
- Ensure that your workload stays available during security incidents.
- Maintain and improve your workload's security posture continuously.

## Prerequisites

- Experience with core infrastructure technology such as data storage, compute, and networking
- Experience building or operating technology systems to solve business problems
