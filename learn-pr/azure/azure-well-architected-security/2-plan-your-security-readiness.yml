  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: 'What is a benefit of using segmentation in your approach to security?'
    choices:
    - content: 'Segmentation allows you to isolate access to resources based on the principle of least privilege.'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: 'Correct. Segmentation minimizes the risk of lateral movement by attackers by limiting access to only those resources that are required.'
    - content: 'Segmentation blocks all access to resources, which prevents attackers from accessing them.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'Incorrect. Segmentation blocks access only to resources that are not required, not all resources.'
    - content: 'Segmentation forces all users to use multifactor authentication (MFA) to access resources.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'Incorrect. Segmentation is a strategy to limit access to resources, not a strategy to enforce MFA.'
    - content: 'Segmentation forces all users to use single sign-on (SSO) to access resources.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'Incorrect. Segmentation is a strategy to limit access to resources, not a strategy to enforce SSO.'
  - content: 'What type of plan should you create to ensure that security events are detected and responded to in a timely manner?'
    choices:
    - content: 'A disaster recovery plan'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'Incorrect. Although some security incidents may qualify as disasters, you should have a plan that focuses directly on security incidents as well.'
    - content: 'A business continuity plan'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'Incorrect. Although security incidents may affect business continuity, you should have a plan that focuses directly on security incidents as well.'
    - content: 'A security incident response plan'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: 'Correct. A security incident response plan defines the actions that you should take in response to a security incident.'
    - content: 'A DDoS mitigation plan'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'Incorrect. Although a DDoS attack is a type of security incident, you should have a plan that focuses on all types of security incidents.'
  - content: "True or false: Contoso's use of secure development practices will help the team ensure that all code is developed in a consistent standard manner."
    choices:
    - content: 'True.'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: 'Correct. Secure development practices dictate the standards that all code development should follow at all times.'
    - content: 'False.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'Incorrect. Secure development practices dictate the standards that all code development should follow at all times.'
