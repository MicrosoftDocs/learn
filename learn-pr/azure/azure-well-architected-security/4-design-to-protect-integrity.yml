  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: 'Which of the following is a reason to adopt threat scanning in your supply chain'
    choices:
    - content: 'Scanning can help detect vulnerabilities in your code.'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: 'Correct. If attackers breach your systems, the threat of them injecting malicious code is serious.'
    - content: 'Scanning prevents attackers from exploiting vulnerabilities in your software.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Scanning doesn't prevent attackers from exploiting vulnerabilities in your software, but it helps you identify vulnerabilities before you release code to production."
    - content: 'Scanning ensures that your code is free of vulnerabilities.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Scanning doesn't ensure that your code is free of vulnerabilities, but it helps you identify vulnerabilities before you release code to production."
    - content: "Scanning ensures that your code is free of malware." 
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Scanning doesn't ensure that your code is free of malware, but it helps you identify malware before you release code to production."
  - content: 'Which of these are examples of cryptographic controls?'
    choices:
    - content: "Using Azure SQL Database's firewall function to block access to a database."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A firewall isn't a cryptographic control, it is a network control."
    - content: 'Using code signing and encryption.'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: 'Correct. Code signing and encryption are examples of cryptographic controls.'
    - content: 'Using Azure Policy to enforce security baselines.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Azure Policy isn't a cryptographic control, it is a policy-based control."
    - content: 'Using Microsoft Sentinel to scan your environment.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Microsoft Sentinel isn't a cryptographic control, it is a security information and event management (SIEM) tool."
  - content: 'How did Contoso ensure that their report backup is immutable?'
    choices:
    - content: "They automatically move the report to Archive Storage after it's created."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Although Archive Storage is immutable, Contoso's report isn't automatically moved to Archive Storage."
    - content: 'The backup is only kept on VM disk storage.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. VM disk storage is not immutable, and the backup isn't kept only on VM disk storage."
    - content: 'The report is automatically deleted after 30 days.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The report isn't automatically deleted after 30 days, and even if it was, that wouldn't make it immutable."
    - content: 'The report is backed up to Azure Storage using the write-once-read-many (WORM) feature.'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The WORM feature of Azure Storage ensures that the report is immutable."
