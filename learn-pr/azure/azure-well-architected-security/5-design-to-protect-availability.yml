  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: 'How did Contoso use security controls to respond to an attack that overwhelmed their system?'
    choices:
    - content: 'They used adopted a design pattern that minimized the blast radius attacks like this one.'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: 'Correct. By decoupling their application into smaller components, Contoso was able to minimize the blast radius of future similar attacks.'
    - content: 'They blocked access to public-facing services.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Blocking access to public-facing services would've prevented legitimate users from accessing the application."
    - content: 'They invested in a third-party DDoS protection service.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The attack wasn't a DDoS attack and they were able to respond to the attack without the help of a third-party service."
    - content: 'They increased the number of virtual machines in their application.'  
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This measure would've increased the cost of the application without addressing the root cause of the problem."
  - content: 'What is an example of a preventative measure that can be used to limit attack vectors?'
    choices:
    - content: "Monitoring resource health"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Monitoring resource health is a reactive measure that can be used to respond to an attack, but it does not prevent the attack from happening."
    - content: 'Using an anti-malware solution'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: 'Correct. Using anti-malware software can prevent malware from being installed on a system.'
    - content: 'Enabling autoscaling on virtual machines'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Autoscaling is good for responding to increased requests, but doesn't limit attack vectors."
    - content: 'Using Azure Traffic Manager to block malicious traffic'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Azure Traffic Manager is used to route traffic to different endpoints, but it does not block malicious traffic."
  - content: "True or false: when running in a recovery environment, it's OK to have a relaxed security posture in comparison to the production environment."
    choices:
    - content: "True"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The recovery environment should be as secure as the production environment."
    - content: 'False'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: 'Correct. The recovery environment should be as secure as the production environment.'
