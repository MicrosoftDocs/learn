  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: Your organization needs to ensure that no transactional SQL database data is ever lost. All SQL database data must always be available and readable in a separate region for redundancy and to comply with standards. How should you architect this sort of resilience?
    choices:
    - content: Use Azure SQL Database and use active geo-replication to replicate to another region.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Active geo-replication would enable you to have readable secondaries in another region.
    - content: Use SQL Server virtual machines and use Azure Site Recovery to recover them in another region.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: You wouldn't be able to read from the replica because it doesn't exist until a failover happens.
    - content: Use SQL Server virtual machines and use Azure Backup to back data up to another region.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Your data wouldn't be accessible for reads, and it wouldn't have any secondary databases until you restored them by using the backed-up data.
  - content: What are some benefits of moving your data workloads to Azure Cosmos DB now that your online store is moving to multiple regions?
    choices:
    - content: You can perform row-level security, with low latency on your data in another region.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Azure Cosmos DB doesn't support row-level security.
    - content: You can have up to 500 databases, with low latency access in another region.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Azure Cosmos DB gives you unlimited databases.
    - content: You can have read access to your data, with low latency in another region.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: You can let your clients access the other region for reads, which gives you the ability to spread usage across multiple regions.
