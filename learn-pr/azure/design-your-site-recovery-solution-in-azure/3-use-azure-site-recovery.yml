  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: List three key benefits of using Azure Site Recovery as part of a BCDR solution.
    choices:
    - content: Azure VM replication, avoiding failovers, consistency with failover.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: You use Azure Site Recovery because you want to fail over, not because you want to avoid a failover.
    - content: Azure VM replication, increased RTO, consistency with failover.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Azure Site Recovery is designed to decrease a recovery time objective.
    - content: Azure VM replication, on-premises replication to Azure, consistency with failover.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: You can replicate your infrastructure in Azure and achieve app-consistent replication by using Azure Site Recovery.
  - content: List three key considerations that relate to replication of virtual machines.
    choices:
    - content: IP reservations, load-balanced traffic, IP subnet/gateway consistency.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: You use Azure Traffic Manager and Azure Load Balancer to route traffic to your virtual machines.
    - content: IP reservations, IP subnet/gateway consistency, retaining MAC address.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: You can't retain the same MAC address when you're replicating virtual machines.
    - content: Load-balanced traffic, IP reservations, maximum of one virtual machine per subnet.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: You can have many virtual machines in a subnet.
