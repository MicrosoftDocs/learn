  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: What's the difference between Azure Backup and Azure Site Recovery?
    choices:
    - content: Azure Site Recovery helps protect Azure VMs, whereas Azure Backup helps protect only on-premises targets. You would use Azure Site Recovery to trigger a failover from on-premises virtual machines to an Azure environment.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Azure Backup can back up Azure virtual machines.
    - content: Azure Site Recovery can help keep workloads running, whereas Azure Backup can help keep data safe.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: You can use Azure Site Recovery and Azure Backup together to help ensure that you have a good business continuity and disaster recovery process in place. You would use Azure Site Recovery to trigger a failover from on-premises virtual machines to an Azure environment.
    - content: Azure Site Recovery is for retaining long-term data, whereas Azure Backup is for retaining short-term data. You would use Azure Backup to trigger a test failover from an on-premises infrastructure to an Azure infrastructure.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Azure Site Recovery isn't for long-term data retention. Azure Backup is for long-term data retention. You have 9,999 retention points. With daily usage, you wouldn't run out of retention points for 27 years. You also wouldn't use Azure Backup to trigger a test failover to another site. Instead, you would use Azure Site Recovery.
  - content: What are some Azure features that contribute to high availability of virtual machines?
    choices:
    - content: Availability sets, recovery zones.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Recovery zones don't exist in Azure. Availability zones do exist, and they can help increase the availability of virtual machines.
    - content: Availability zones, region pairing.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Using availability zones and region pairing together increases the availability of virtual machines.
    - content: Availability points, region pairing.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Availability points don't exist in Azure. You can use availability sets and availability zones to increase the availability of virtual machines.
