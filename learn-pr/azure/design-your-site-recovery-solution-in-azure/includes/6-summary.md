Your organization, which runs workloads in the cloud and on-premises, needed a recovery strategy for their applications. You were asked to select appropriate solutions based on the organization's requirements, while keeping down costs and complexity.

You developed a business continuity and disaster recovery (BCDR) plan. You used Azure Site Recovery and Azure Backup as part of your plan, and explored how you can build resilience for your applications to ensure they can keep running. You also looked at how you can build resilience for the data your applications rely on, while maintaining access to it.

Imagine if you didn't have a disaster recovery solution in place. Your organization's applications would be continually at risk. Your data would also be at risk. If a failure occurred, your organization would have likely incurred massive costs, potential legal repercussions, and possible loss of reputation.

By the end of this module, you were able to put together a disaster recovery solution to help keep your organization's applications running if there was a failure, whether small or large. You've learned how to use several Azure tools together as part of your solution to meet the organization's requirements.
