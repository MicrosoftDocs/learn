- intermediate

## Product(s)

- azure-sql-database
- azure-iot
- azure-iot-hub
- azure-virtual-machines
- azure-functions
- azure-log-analytics

## Prerequisites

- Introductory knowledge of Azure IoT
- Ability to navigate the Azure portal
- Ability to connect to an Azure Virtual Machine

## Summary

In this module, you will deploy a baseline IoT solution that leverages Azure SQL Database as the backend database. First, you'll analyze the solution architecture and how it can be used for IoT solutions. Next, you'll deploy the solution template and configure the device simulator. Finally, you'll implement, monitor, and react to a workload, using tools like Azure Functions, Azure IoT Hub, and dashboards.

## Learning objectives

1. Create scalable IoT solutions using Azure SQL Database
1. Use the template provided and apply it to a given IoT use case

## Chunk your content into subtasks

Identify the subtasks of *module title*

| Subtask | What part of the introduction scenario does this subtask satisfy? | How will you assess it: **Exercise or Knowledge check**? | Which learning objective(s) does this help meet? | Does the subtask have enough learning content to justify an entire unit? If not, which other subtask will you combine it with? |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Understand the solution architecture | Main scenario | Knowledge check | Both | Yes |
| Deploy the template and get simulation running | Main scenario | Exercises | Both | Yes |
| Monitor and analyze the functioning solution | Main scenario | Exercise | Both | Yes |
| Summarize and suggest other use cases/scenarios | New scenarios | Knowledge check | Both | Yes|

## Outline the units

*Add more units as needed for your content*

1. **Introduction**

    Provide a scenario of a real-world job-task that shows how the technology is used in practice:

    TODO WRITE SCENARIO https://review.docs.microsoft.com/en-us/help/learn/id-guidance-scenarios?branch=master

1. **Analyze the solution architecture**

    List the content that will enable the learner to *subtask*:

    - Explain the need for the reusable architecture -- may be able to mention customer examples. Relate to scenario in introduction as well
    - Present the architecture
    - Explain each component, why it was used over alternatives, specific advantages.

    **Knowledge check**

    What types of questions will test *learning objective*? *[(Knowledge check guidance)](/help/learn/id-guidance-knowledge-check)*

    - Which component of the architecture will help with X?
    - What is the advantage of using Azure SQL Database for IoT scenarios?

1. **Exercise - Deploy the solution with Azure**

    List the steps which apply the learning content from previous unit:

    1. Step
    1. Step
    1. Step

1. **Store IoT data in real time with Azure SQL Database**

    List the content that will enable the learner to *subtask*:

    - How device / streaming simulation works
    - How to process/store the data in Azure SQL Database
    - Best practices for optimizing performance/throughput 

    **Knowledge check**

    What types of questions will test *learning objective*? *[(Knowledge check guidance)](/help/learn/id-guidance-knowledge-check)*

    - Best practices related question
    - Question that brings in a new potential scenario and asks about a component of how Azure SQL DB will support that scenario

1. **Exercise - Configure streaming simulation for the IoT solution**

    List the steps which apply the learning content from previous unit:

    1. Step
    1. Step
    1. Step

1. **Exercise - Analyze results with Power BI in real time**

    List the steps which apply the learning content from previous unit:

    1. Connect to datasource
    1. Refresh and view results

1. **Summary**

    How did you solve the problem in the initial scenario with the knowledge learned in the module?

    - What are some potential other scenarios this could be used for
    - What are the modifications you may need to make depending on the scenarios

    *Add your summary [(Summary guidance)](/help/learn/id-guidance-module-summary-unit)*
