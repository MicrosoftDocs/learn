  questions:
  - content: "What is **not** a piece of the shock absorber pattern?"
    choices:
    - content: "Load current data into a memory optimized table."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This part is a key piece of the shock absorber pattern."
    - content: "Call a natively compiled stored procedure with a memory-optimized table-valued parameter."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. You can leverage load current data into a memory-optimized table by calling this configuration of stored procedure and table-valued parameter."
    - content: "Use JSON support for high ingestion."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! Azure SQL Database supports JSON, but it is not a direct requirement for the shock absorber pattern."
    - content: "Offload historical data into a disk-based clustered columnstore table."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Loading data into columnstore can help reduce scaling issues and logging."      
  - content: "Considering all the Azure SQL Database Hyperscale replication options, what is the current maximum number of replicas you could configure for read-scaling?"
    choices:
    - content: "4"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. You can configure 0-4 high availability replicas, but there are several additional options for read-scale."
    - content: "30"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. You can configure 0-30 named replicas, but there are several additional options for read-scale."
    - content: "34"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. You can configure 0-4 high availability replicas and 0-30 named replicas, but there is also geo-replication."
    - content: "35"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! You can configure 0-4 high availability replicas, 0-30 named replicas, plus 1 geo-replica. When geo-replication becomes generally available, this number may increase!"
