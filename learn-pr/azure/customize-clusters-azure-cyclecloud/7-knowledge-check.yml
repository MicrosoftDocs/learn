    choices:
    - content: "cluster"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "A template must include at least one cluster section, which contains one or more node and nodearray sections that describe child objects of that cluster."
    - content: "nodearray"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "A node section can be only nested within the cluster section."
    - content: "configuration"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "A configuration is a child object of a node or a nodearray object."
  - content: "You customized an Azure CycleCloud template. Now you want to create a cluster based on that template and start it afterwards. You want to minimize the number of steps to accomplish your goal. Which Azure CycleCloud CLI command should you run first?"
    choices:
    - content: "cyclecloud import_template"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This command allows you to import the template, but you still have to create the cluster before you can start it."
    - content: "cyclecloud import_cluster"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "This command allows you to create a cluster without explicitly importing the template."
    - content: "cyclecloud create_cluster"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This command requires that you first import the template."
  - content: "You created an Azure CycleCloud cluster based on the GitHub Slurm repository. Then, you configured its nodes with a cloud-init script. You need to connect to a cluster node from an Azure Cloud Shell session to validate that the script runs successfully. What authentication method should you use?"
    choices:
    - content: "Microsoft Entra ID"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Slurm cluster nodes created based on the Azure CycleCloud GitHub Slurm repository don't support Microsoft Entra authentication."
    - content: "Microsoft Entra Domain Services"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Slurm cluster nodes created based on the Azure CycleCloud GitHub Slurm repository don't support Microsoft Entra Domain Services authentication."
    - content: "SSH keys"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "This connection relies on SSH key-based authentication."
