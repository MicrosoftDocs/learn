Imagine you're the solution architect for a manufacturing company. Your company is beginning a project to move many services out of its existing datacenter and into the Azure cloud. The company wants to integrate the existing network with Azure. You need to plan the public and private IP addresses for the network carefully so you donâ€™t run out of addresses and have capacity for future growth. A good IP addressing scheme provides flexibility, room for growth, and integration with on-premises networks.

In this module, you learn about the public and private IP addressing capabilities of Azure virtual networks. Also, you learn how to gather the necessary requirements for planning an IP address scheme. This module covers the on-premises integration methods of point-to-site and site-to-site, and also virtual network-to-virtual network peering. You'll also design and implement virtual networks and configure and verify virtual network peering. By the end of this module, you'll understand how to plan IP addressing for an Azure network and how to integrate Azure with an on-premises network.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you'll:

- Identify the private IP addressing capabilities of Azure virtual networks.
- Identify the public IP addressing capabilities of Azure.
- Identify the requirements for IP addressing when integrating with on-premises networks.

## Prerequisites

- Knowledge of basic networking concepts, network subnets, and IP addressing
- Familiarity with Azure virtual networking
