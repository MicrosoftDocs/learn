  questions:
  - content: "A financial company has an application hosted in an Azure Kubernetes Service cluster in the East US Azure region. They recently have seen a spike in cost of network traffic between their satellite office in the Western Europe Azure region and the application in the East US Azure region. They've determined that the application doesn't require high network performance or low latency. What routing preference should the financial company choose for their application's public IP address?"
    choices:
    - content: "The financial company should choose the Internet option."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "The routing preference of Internet would fulfill the requirements of cost savings, as most of the traffic destined for and from an application or service in Azure uses the public Internet for most the travel."
    - content: "The financial company should choose the Microsoft network option."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The routing preference of Microsoft network would work for the application or service for the financial company, but doesn't fulfill the cost savings requirement. Most traffic traverses the Microsoft network with this routing preference and would be subject to region egress costs."
    - content: "The financial company should choose the Extranet option."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Extranet isn't a routing preference option for an Azure public IP address. An extranet is a private network that allows controlled access to authorized external users, typically for business purposes. It extends an organization's intranet beyond its boundaries to include partners, vendors, and customers."
  - content: "A multi-national/regional car manufacturer wishes to use routing preference unmetered for CDN origin content stored in Azure. Who does the car manufacturer contact to determine if their CDN provider is a member of the program?"
    choices:
    - content: "The CDN provider"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "To utilize the benefits of routing preference unmetered, your CDN provider must be enrolled in the program. If your current CDN provider isn't a part of the program, reach out to them for assistance."
    - content: "Azure support"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The determination of whether routing preference unmetered can be used is dependent on the CDN provider enrollment in the routing preference unmetered program. Azure support wouldn't be able to assist if the CDN provider isn't a member of the program."
    - content: "The Internet Service Provider"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The determination of whether routing preference unmetered can be used is dependent on the CDN provider enrollment in the routing preference unmetered program. The Internet Service Provider wouldn't be able to assist if the CDN provider isn't a member of the program."
  - content: "A multi-national/regional car manufacturer has an application in the South Central US Azure region that requires the least amount of latency and the most network performance as possible. What routing preference should the network engineer choose for the application's public IP address?"
    choices:
    - content: "The engineer should choose the Microsoft network option."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "The routing preference of Microsoft network provides the best latency and network performance. This routing preference fulfills the requirement of the application performance. The Internet routing option, though fast and comparable to other cloud providers, is subject to performance and latency issues that could occur with traffic traversing the public Internet."
    - content: "The engineer should choose the Internet option."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The routing preference of Internet doesn't fulfill the requirement of the application for network and latency performance."
    - content: "The engineer should choose the BGP option."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "BGP stands for Border Gateway Protocol, which is a standardized protocol used to exchange routing information between different autonomous systems (AS) on the internet. It's responsible for making core routing decisions on the internet, including directing traffic between different networks. BGP is unrelated to Azure routing preference and isn't an option for an Azure public IP address."
  - content: "Can a network administrator change the routing preference for a public IP address in Azure?"
    choices:
    - content: "No, once a public IP address is created, the routing preference can't be changed."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "A public IP address in Azure once it's created can't have the routing preference changed. To change the routing preference of an application or service associated with a public IP address, create a new public IP address with the preferred routing preference and associate it with the application or service."
    - content: "Yes, an administrator can change the routing preference for a public IP address in Azure."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Once a public IP address is created, the routing preference can't be changed. To change the routing preference of an application or service associated with a public IP address, create a new public IP address with the preferred routing preference and associate it with the application or service."
    - content: "Yes, an administrator can change the routing preference, but they have to contact Azure support to change the routing preference option."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Once a public IP address is created, the routing preference can't be changed. To change the routing preference of an application or service associated with a public IP address, create a new public IP address with the preferred routing preference and associate it with the application or service. An Azure support call isn't required."
  - content: "The two options for routing preference are Microsoft network and Internet. What is another food related name for these options?"
    choices:
    - content: "The two options are hot potato routing for the Internet option and cold potato for the Microsoft network option."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "The terms hot potato and cold potato routing refer to how network traffic travels to and from an application or service hosted in Azure.  Hot potato routing refers to traffic that routes across the public internet and enters the Microsoft network closest to the Azure region where the application or service is deployed. Cold potato routing refers to traffic that routes across the public Internet, but enters the Microsoft network closest to the user accessing the application or service deployed."
    - content: "The two options are hot potato routing for the Microsoft network option and cold potato for the Internet option."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The terms are reversed. The terms hot potato and cold potato routing refer to how network traffic travels to and from an application or service hosted in Azure.  Hot potato routing refers to traffic that routes across the public internet and enters the Microsoft network closest to the Azure region where the application or service is deployed. Cold potato routing refers to traffic that routes across the public Internet, but enters the Microsoft network closest to the user accessing the application or service deployed."
    - content: "The two options are hot coffee routing for Internet option and cold coffee routing for the Microsoft network option."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The terms hot coffee and cold coffee aren't valid terms for the routing preference in Azure. The terms hot potato and cold potato routing refer to how network traffic travels to and from an application or service hosted in Azure.  Hot potato routing refers to traffic that routes across the public internet and enters the Microsoft network closest to the Azure region where the application or service is deployed. Cold potato routing refers to traffic that routes across the public Internet, but enters the Microsoft network closest to the user accessing the application or service deployed."
