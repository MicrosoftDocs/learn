Your company needs to launch new toys regularly to stay competitive. The shorter the time to market, the better.

You've created a file that deploys a website and storage resources. This file is reusable for future product launches, which means you've significantly cut the time it takes to launch a new product.

You created a Bicep file to deploy a basic storage account, an Azure App Service plan, and an application. You parameterized the file to make it useful for future products. You then refactored it into modules to make the file more reusable and easier to understand and work with. Finally, you added an output to send information from a file deployment back to the person or tool executing the deployment.

Imagine how much work it would be to deploy these resources for each new product launch. You'd have to manually provision the resources and remember to configure them correctly each time.

Bicep makes it easy to describe your Azure resources and create reusable files. You can parameterize the files and use modules to separate your files into different components that you can reuse and work on individually.

Now, when you want to prepare your resources for the next product launch, you can use the Bicep file you created with parameter values unique to the product launch. Your company can quickly and easily provision its Azure resources.
