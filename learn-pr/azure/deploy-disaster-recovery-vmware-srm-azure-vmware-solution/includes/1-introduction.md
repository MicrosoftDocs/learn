You can use VMware Site Recovery Manager (SRM) and vSphere Replication with Azure VMware Solution for disaster recovery of VMware vSphere virtual machines (VMs).

## Example scenario

Suppose you work for an organization that runs business-critical applications and has a datacenter in an earthquake zone. You've been tasked with providing disaster recovery for the applications in the event the organization’s infrastructure suffers an outage. Many of the organization’s production workloads run on a VMware vSphere platform and are distributed across several branch offices.

Your company recently deployed Azure VMware Solution to migrate existing VMware vSphere workloads from on-premises to Azure. Your company is also exploring the option of using Azure VMware Solution as a disaster-recovery solution with VMware SRM. Your company already uses VMware SRM to replicate virtual machines (VMs) between different branch offices. Therefore, using Azure VMware Solution would be a viable option for strengthening disaster-recovery options for both on-premises and Azure VMware Solution VMs.

Azure VMware Solution provides you with vSphere clusters built from dedicated, bare-metal Azure infrastructure. By using Azure VMware Solution, your company won’t have to change virtualization platforms or alter existing operational patterns.

### What will we be doing?

In this module, you'll explore how to use the features in VMware SRM and vSphere Replication with Azure VMware Solution to support business continuity and disaster recovery (BCDR) plans.

### What is the main goal?

By the end of this module, you’ll be able to implement disaster recovery for VMware vSphere VMs that run either at your on-premises facility or in an Azure VMware Solution. You’ll examine the prerequisites for both scenarios and the steps necessary to implement the solution.
