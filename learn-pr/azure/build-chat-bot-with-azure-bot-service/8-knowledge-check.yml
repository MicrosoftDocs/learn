    - content: "A knowledge base that can be used by a bot."
      isCorrect: true

    - content: "Surveys you can embed in your bot to get user feedback."

    - content: "Upload a text file."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "QnA Maker supports text files in many different formats such as tab-separated-values and Excel spreadsheet. However, this is not the only way to populate the knowledge base."
    - content: "Provide the URL of a FAQ page."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "QnA Maker can extract questions and answers from many different FAQ-page formats. However, a FAQ URL isn't the only way to populate the knowledge base."
    - content: "All of the above."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "QnA Maker is flexible enough to handle your input data in several of the most common formats: text files, FAQ pages, and even product manuals. The goal is to make it convenient for you to import your data without reformatting."
