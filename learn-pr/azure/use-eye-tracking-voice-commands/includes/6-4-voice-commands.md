## Advantages of voice input

Voice input is a natural way to communicate our intents. Voice is especially good at interface traversals, because it can help users cut through multiple steps of an interface. A user might say "go back" while looking at a webpage, instead of having to go up and hit the back button in the app. This small time saving has a powerful emotional effect on users' perception of the experience. Using voice is also a convenient input method when we have our arms full or are multitasking. On devices where typing on a keyboard is difficult, voice dictation can be an efficient alternative way to input text. Lastly, in some cases when the range of accuracy for gaze and gesture are limited, voice can help to disambiguate the user's intent.
