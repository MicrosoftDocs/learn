In this exercise, you'll learn how to create speech commands with StatefulInteractables.

## Ensure MRTK Speech object is enabled

* In the Hierarchy window, select the **MRTK XR Rig** > **MRTK Speech** game object and make sure it's enabled.

The **MRTK Speech** object contains the **Speech Interactor** component. StatefulInteractable components register keywords with the SpeechInteractor, and the SpeechInteractor passes along keyword events to the corresponding StatefulInteractable components.

## Enable the keyword recognition subsystem

* The Keyword Recognition Subsystem needs to be enabled for voice commands to work. Go to **Edit** > **Project Settings** > **MRTK3** and make sure the **MRTK Windows KeywordRecognition Subsystem** is selected.

## Control speech commands

1. From the [previous module](/training/modules/get-started-with-object-interaction), you should have a GameObject named **Menu.** Select **Menu** > **MenuContent-HorizontalLayout (Menu and Pin)** > **Buttons-GridLayout (Buttons)** > **Indicator** and configure it as follows:
    1) In the **Pressable Button** component, enter the keyword **enable indicator** for Speech Recognition under **Advanced StatefullInteractable Settings** section.
    2) Deselect **Voice Requires Focus** so the user isn't required to look at the object to trigger the speech command.

2. Repeat these steps for the **TapToPlace**, **BoundsControl_Enable**, and **BoundsControl_Disable** buttons, but using the keywords **Enable Tap to Place**, **Enable Bounds Control**, and **Disable Bounds Control**, respectively.

3. If you use Holographic Remoting for Play mode to preview and debug your app, make sure the **Enable Audio** option is selected.
