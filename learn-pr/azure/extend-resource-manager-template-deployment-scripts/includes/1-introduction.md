Deployment scripts in Azure Resource Manager templates (ARM templates) enable custom automation for your environment management. You use deployment scripts to execute your own scripts within your ARM template deployments.

## Example scenario

Suppose you're a member of a cross-functional team that supports an application. Your team adopted ARM templates for creating and managing the environments for your application. Part of the application environment includes staging some assets in a storage account. You want to use a deployment script to ensure that the storage account has the required assets.

## What are you going to do?

In this module, you learn how to add custom behavior to your Bicep or JSON ARM templates by using a deployment script.

## What is the main goal?

By the end of this module, you're able to perform custom steps in your ARM templates by using a deployment script. You're also able to define parameters to make your deployment scripts more reusable.

## Prerequisites

You should be familiar with:

- Creating and deploying basic ARM templates, using either Bicep or JSON.
- Working with Azure, including the Azure portal, subscriptions, resource groups, and resource definitions.

To follow along with the exercises in the module, you need:

- An [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?azure-portal=true).
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com?azure-portal=true) installed locally.
- Either:
  - The [Bicep extension for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-bicep), installed locally.
  - The [Azure Resource Manager Tools for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=msazurermtools.azurerm-vscode-tools&azure-portal=true) extension, installed locally.
- Either:
  - The latest [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?azure-portal=true) tools installed locally.
  - The latest [Azure PowerShell](/powershell/azure/install-az-ps?azure-portal=true) version installed locally.
