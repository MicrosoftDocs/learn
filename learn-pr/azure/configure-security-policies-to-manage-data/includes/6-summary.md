Data classification and analysis helps you know what data you need to protect. It also helps you assess the risks involved in using, storing, and transmitting that data. Every organization has unique data that has distinct security requirements. Unless specific work is done to identify the risks involved in a security breach, the costs and tools needed to protect that data can't be fully understood.
