Classify your data and identify your data-protection needs to help you select the right cloud solution for your organization. Data classification allows organizations to find storage optimizations that might not be possible when all data is assigned the same value. Classifying (or categorizing) stored data by sensitivity and business impact helps organizations determine the risks associated with the data. After their data has been classified, organizations can manage their data in ways that reflect their internal value instead of treating all data the same way.

Data classification can yield benefits such as compliance efficiencies, improved ways to manage the organizationâ€™s resources, and facilitation of migration to the cloud. Some data-protection solutions such as encryption, rights management, and data loss prevention have moved to the cloud, and can help mitigate cloud risks. However, organizations must be sure to address data-classification rules for data retention when moving to the cloud.
