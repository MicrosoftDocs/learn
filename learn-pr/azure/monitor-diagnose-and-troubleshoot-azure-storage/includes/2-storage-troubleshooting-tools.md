Diagnosing and troubleshooting issues for an application hosted in a cloud environment can be more complicated than in traditional environments. To support these types of applications successfully, you should monitor them and understand how to diagnose and troubleshoot any aspects of them and their dependent technologies. You can use a combination of tools and logging to identify issues. 

The new Automobile Distribution customer portal uses Azure Storage to store uploaded files. As there are some concerns about the performance of storing data in the portal, the first step to diagnosing any issues is knowing which troubleshooting tools you can use.

In this unit, you'll learn about some of the different tools you can use to analyze issues with Azure Storage.

## Tools available for troubleshooting Azure Storage

There are several tools you can use to monitor Azure Storage. You can use the information generated by these tools to help pinpoint issues. You would typically use a combination of these tools to give you a richer view of what's happening. More tools are available from third-party sources, but we won't discuss them here.

### Azure portal

The Azure portal gives you a graphical way to view and monitor storage performance in near real time. There can be a delay of a few minutes between capturing data and data appearing on the Azure portal. In the Azure portal, you can:

- Configure metrics and logging
- View graphs and charts, and select which metrics to visualize
- Assess how your applications are doing over some time
- Configure alerts to notify you of any behavior that is out of the ordinary

You can monitor the performance of a storage account using the **Overview** tab on the storage account page. Scroll down to the **Monitoring** section and choose what data to show. The image below shows an example that includes the ingress, egress, average latency, and request breakdown for blob storage in a storage account:

### Azure Storage Explorer (desktop version)

The desktop version of [Azure Storage Explorer](https://azure.microsoft.com/features/storage-explorer/) gives you another way to view the logs and metrics gathered by Azure Storage Analytics. The **\$Metrics** tables and the **$logs** container are accessible in Storage Explorer, and you can export the data, including the metrics in the **\$Metrics** tables, to a folder on your computer.

### AzCopy

You can download the storage account logs to your local computer by using the [AzCopy](/azure/storage/common/storage-use-azcopy-v10) utility, or the desktop version of [Azure Storage Explorer](https://azure.microsoft.com/features/storage-explorer/). You can then analyze this data using analysis tools on your desktop.

Unlike Azure Storage Explorer, you can't use AzCopy to download data from storage tables. As a result, you can't use this tool to retrieve the data from the **\$Metrics** tables.

> [!NOTE]
> The **\$logs** container is hidden from many Azure tools. For example, you won't see it appear in the online version of Storage Explorer the Azure portal uses, or in the Cloud Explorer in Visual Studio. AzCopy and the desktop version of Azure Storage Explorer are exceptions.
