1. Introduction

    You own a smart building management company that uses localized, separate, on-premises security management tools that have many gaps.

    You're looking to move to the cloud to increase efficiency and consistency across your network. Outline the needs of both your *operations* teams and OT *security* teams so that you can find a single solution to serve both sets of needs.

1. What is Microsoft Defender for IoT?

    Defender for IoT can provide end-to-end security services for your operational networks, from asset discovery across your network to ongoing threat detection and alert monitoring.

    Defender for IoT can be deployed in various environments, including cloud, air-gapped (fully on-premises), and hybrid.

    Defender for IoT features include:

    - Asset and device discovery
    - Advanced threat detection
    - Risk and vulnerability management
    - Alert response features
    - Sensor management from a central system

1. How does Microsoft Defender for IoT work with operational networks?

    Defender for IoT has a set of sensor machines that are each connected to your OT/IoT devices. Sensors detect all devices in the vicinity and on the network, and send reports and data back to a central management system for tracking and analysis.

    Defender for IoT uses machine learning engines and threat intelligence packages to track and alert on any vulnerability or risk detected.

1. When to use Microsoft Defender for IoT to secure operational networks?

    Use Defender for IoT when you want to secure your OT/IoT assets using a single pane of glass, with a solution that provides visibility across your network, machine learning for threat detection and vulnerability management, and automated response activities. Use Defender for IoT whether you need a fully on-premises, cloud, or hybrid solution.

    If you need to secure IoT devices in an enterprise organization, such as corporate printers or cameras, make sure to choose onboarding options for *Enterprise* IoT instead of *OT/IoT*. While Defender for IoT can secure both operational networks and enterprise networks, they have different deployment options and architectures.
