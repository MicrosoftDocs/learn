  questions:
  - content: "Which area in Defender for IoT in the Azure portal is the most seamless for SOC teams to use if they already use other Azure services and want to start integrating with Defender for IoT?"
    choices:
    - content: "The **Sites and sensors** page"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The **Sites and sensors** page in the Azure portal will look familiar to experienced Azure users. It displays all the sensors you currently have on Defender for IoT and also provides links to onboard new sensors."
    - content: "Device inventory"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The device inventory is currently available in general availability in the sensor console. While the sensor console's look and feel mimics that of the Azure portal, users must access the sensor console separately."
    - content: "Risk assessment reports"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Risk assessment reports are currently available only from the sensor console. While the sensor console's look and feel mimics that of the Azure portal, users must access the sensor console separately and can't currently view reports directly in the Azure portal."
  - content: "Which of the following are examples of alerts triggered by the Defender for IoT *policy violation* detection engine?"
    choices:
    - content: "Excessive SMB sign-in attempts or PLC scans"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Unusual machine-to-machine communications and behaviors are detected by the *anomaly detection* engine. In contrast, the policy violation detection engine triggers alerts for deviations in baseline behavior. For example, deviations might include unauthorized use of specific function codes, access to specific objects, or changes to device configuration."
    - content: "Software or firmware changes or unauthorized PLC programming alerts"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The policy violation detection engine triggers alerts for deviations in baseline behavior. For example, deviations might include unauthorized use of specific function codes, access to specific objects, or changes to device configuration."
    - content: "Unresponsive devices or alerts about equipment failure"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. When a device is unresponsive and might be disconnected, alerts are triggered by the *operational incident detection* engine. In contrast, the policy violation detection engine triggers alerts for deviations in baseline behavior. For example, deviations might include unauthorized use of specific function codes, access to specific objects, or changes to device configuration."
  - content: "How can Defender for IoT support organizations that want to move their OT security systems to the cloud?"
    choices:
    - content: "Defender for IoT supports mostly on-premises deployments, with some site visibility from the Azure portal."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. You can extend Defender for IoT to the cloud in a hybrid deployment or deploy fully in the cloud."
    - content: "Defender for IoT is a cloud-only service with migration options from other on-premises services."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While you can deploy Defender for IoT in the cloud only, you can also deploy fully on-premises for an air-gapped environment, or in a hybrid deployment that matches your organization's needs."
    - content: "Defender for IoT provides flexible deployment options in the cloud, on-premises, or in a hybrid environment."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. You can deploy Defender for IoT fully in the cloud, fully on-premises for an air-gapped environment, or in a hybrid deployment that matches your organization's needs. You can manage sensors from the Azure portal for cloud deployments or from an on-premises management console for on-premises environments."
  - content: "How can SOC teams use Defender for IoT together with other Azure services to secure network environments?"
    choices:
    - content: "SOC teams can use the integration between Defender for IoT and Microsoft Sentinel to run efficient security investigations."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. You can use the IoT OT Threat Monitoring with Defender for IoT solution in Microsoft Sentinel to view and analyze Defender for IoT alerts in Microsoft Sentinel. Use workbooks to visualize your data, analytics rules to trigger alerts, and playbooks to automate system response."
    - content: "None. Microsoft Defender for IoT is a standalone service for OT/IoT device security."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Microsoft Defender integrates especially well with Microsoft Sentinel. You can use the IoT OT Threat Monitoring with Defender for IoT solution in Microsoft Sentinel to view and analyze your Defender for IoT alerts in Microsoft Sentinel."
    - content: "SOC teams can use Microsoft Entra ID to secure day-to-date network access."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Defender for IoT's strongest Azure integration is with Microsoft Sentinel. You can use the IoT OT Threat Monitoring with Defender for IoT solution in Microsoft Sentinel to view and analyze your Defender for IoT alerts in Microsoft Sentinel, with workbooks that visualize your data, analytics rules, and playbooks that can automate system response."
  - content: "The team lead for an SOC team is highly aware of the constantly changing security landscape. The team lead is concerned about keeping the organization's OT device security up to date with the latest threats. How can the team lead calm the organization's concerns?"
    choices:
    - content: "Constantly read security news and then manually tweak sensor settings as needed."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While personally keeping up to date with security news is always a good idea, the Defender for IoT Section 52 research team continuously curates threat intelligence packages for your network environments. Ensure your network security by keeping threat intelligence packages up to date on your network."
    - content: "Make sure that all network sensors are fully up to date with Defender for IoT threat intelligence packages."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The Defender for IoT security research group, Section 52, ensures that customers have the most up-to-date threat intelligence (TI) packages. TI packages include the latest incidents of concern and common vulnerabilities and exposures."
    - content: "Read through risk assessment reports."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While risk assessment reports help identify known vulnerabilities currently detected in your system, such as unauthorized devices, they won't include new risks and threats as the security landscape changes and evolves."
