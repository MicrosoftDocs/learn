Blazor lets C# developers use their skills to build web apps with C# and Microsoft.NET.

Imagine you're building a client-side web app and already have a team of .NET developers. Also, imagine you want to deploy your app as a progressive web application. Users could then download the app and use it offline.

With Blazor, developers can build front-end and back-end logic for web apps with common languages, frameworks, and tools.

Using the same language for front-end and back-end code can:

- Accelerate app development.
- Reduce the complexity of the build pipeline.
- Simplify maintenance.
- Let developers understand and work on both client-side and server-side code.
