  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "How do network security groups help you control the flow of traffic in your virtual networks?"
    choices:
    - content: "They have strict rules defined to block inbound traffic from the internet, and can't be modified."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "There are default rules, and one does restrict access to inbound traffic from the internet. However, it can be overridden."
    - content: "They act like a stateful firewall, monitoring network traffic and enforcing policies you define."  
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This is how Azure Firewall works, not network security groups."
    - content: "They allow you to create traffic rules, which can allow or deny traffic over specified ports and protocols."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "This is the correct definition of a network security group."     
  - content: "How does using Azure ExpressRoute help improve your security?"
    choices:
    - content: "It provides a dedicated, private connection between your on-premises resources and Azure. Extra security is possible by adding network security appliances between edge routers."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "This is the correct definition of an ExpressRoute connection."
    - content: "It provides a base layer of security by allowing you to segment and isolate your Azure resources."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Segmenting of resources happens when you create virtual networks and have resources assigned to them."
    - content: "It routes traffic from your network to Azure over the internet."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Traffic over an ExpressRoute connection is not routed over the internet. It goes through a private circuit instead."
