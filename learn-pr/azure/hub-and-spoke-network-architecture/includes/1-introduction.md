You work for a large insurance organization that's planning a migration to Azure. Your head office currently hosts all the company's public-facing websites and its insurance quote app. Your company headquarters and satellite offices around the country will still need to access internal resources that were migrated to Azure, and the back-office area of the quote app. Your virtual machine infrastructure has central dependencies, such as Active Directory and DNS, that should be accessible.

In this module, you'll look at a hub-spoke topology in Azure designed for:

- Growth and flexibility
- Planning and designing virtual networks
- Securing your architectural design

The final design will provide for isolation of resources, have a low administrative overhead, and allow communication from on-premises resources.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you'll:

- Identify the requirements and components for a hub-spoke network in Azure.
- Identify the components and limitations for connectivity to on-premises networks.
- Identify methods to secure connectivity in a hub-spoke network.

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of networking concepts in traditional and cloud networks.
