You work for a large insurance organization that's planning a migration to Azure. Your head office currently hosts all the company's public-facing websites and its insurance quote app. Your company headquarters and satellite offices around the country/region still need to access internal resources that were migrated to Azure, along with the back-office area of the quote app. Your virtual machine infrastructure requires access to central services including Active Directory and DNS.

In this module, you review a hub-spoke topology in Azure designed for:

- Growth and flexibility
- Planning and designing virtual networks
- Securing your architectural design

The final design provides for isolation of resources, has a low administrative overhead, and allows communication from on-premises resources.

- Identify the components and limitations for connectivity to on-premises networks.
- Identify methods to secure connectivity in a hub-spoke network.
