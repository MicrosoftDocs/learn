  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "Which one of these choices is a way resources can communicate with each other inside Azure?"
    choices:
    - content: "Have the resources communicate over an ExpressRoute connection."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "An ExpressRoute connection enables connection of your on-premises resources with resources inside Azure."
    - content: "Having the resources inside a single virtual network."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. All resources within a virtual network can communicate in the private address space."
    - content: "Having each resource specify a network endpoint."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Network service endpoints allow your resources to communicate privately with other Azure resources, like Azure Storage. They can't be used to communicate between your own resources."
  - content: "What's the limit for the number of virtual networks you can connect to ExpressRoute?"
    choices:
    - content: "10"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This answer is correct for a standard ExpressRoute circuit, but it isn't the only limit."
    - content: "100"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This is correct for a premium-add on ExpressRoute with a 10 Gbps or larger circuit, but it isn't the only limit."
    - content: "It depends on the size of the circuit."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "The limit is based on the SKU and size of the ExpressRoute circuit. At present, 100 is the maximum for both."
