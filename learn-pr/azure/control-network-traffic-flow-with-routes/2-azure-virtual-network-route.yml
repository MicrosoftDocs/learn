  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
    - content: "Why would you use a custom route in a virtual network?"
      choices:
      - content: "To load balance the traffic within your virtual network."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "This answer is incorrect. A custom route isn't used to load balance traffic. Load balancing is for directing traffic to one or more Azure virtual machines."
      - content: "To connect to your Azure virtual machines using RDP or SSH."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "This answer is incorrect. To control RDP or SSH access to Azure virtual machines, you use network security groups, not custom routes."
      - content: "To control the flow of traffic within your Azure virtual network."
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "This is the correct answer. Custom routes are used to override the default Azure routing so that you can route traffic through a network virtual appliance (NVA)."
      - content: "To connect to resources in another virtual network hosted in Azure."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "This answer is incorrect. Custom routes aren't used to control access to resources in other virtual networks."
    - content: "Why might you use virtual network peering?"
      choices:
      - content: "To connect virtual networks together in the same region or across regions."
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "This is the correct answer. Virtual network peering is used to connect multiple virtual networks together. Once peered, the networks become one network, and resources across virtual networks can communicate with one another."
      - content: "To assign public IP addresses to all of your resources across multiple virtual networks."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "This answer is incorrect. Virtual network peering has no link for assigning public IPs to your resources. Virtual network peering is used for connecting networks and has no effect on public IP address assignment."
      - content: "So that load balancers can control traffic flow across your virtual networks."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "This answer is incorrect. Load balancers aren't required for controlling communication between virtual networks. Load balancers control traffic among multiple endpoints. Virtual network peering is used to connect virtual networks together."
      - content: "To run custom reports that scan and identify what resources are running across all of your virtual networks, as opposed to running reports on each virtual network."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "This answer is incorrect. You can run reports at the subscription level to identify what resources are running. Virtual network peering has no effect on these reports."
