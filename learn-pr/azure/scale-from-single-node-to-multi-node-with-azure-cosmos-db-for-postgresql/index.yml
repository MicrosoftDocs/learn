title: Scale from a single node to multiple nodes by using Azure Cosmos DB for PostgreSQL
summary: |
  Azure Cosmos DB for PostgreSQL can scale from a single-node, nondistributed cluster to a multi-node, distributed cluster with minimal downtime. When you start with small amounts of data, it makes sense to start with a single node. But as time goes on, data needs to scale for growth. By understanding the process of going from a single-node cluster to a multi-node cluster, you can grow your data by using Azure Cosmos DB for PostgreSQL.
abstract: |
  In this module, you'll:
    - Create a single-node instance of Azure Cosmos DB for PostgreSQL.
    - Identify changes to upgrade an existing single-node, nondistributed cluster to a multi-node, distributed cluster.
    - Scale the database and distribute the data across multiple nodes.
prerequisites: |
  - Basic familiarity with relational databases, including creating tables, creating indexes, and querying tables.
