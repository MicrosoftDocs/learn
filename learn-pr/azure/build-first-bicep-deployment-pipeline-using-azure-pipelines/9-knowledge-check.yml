  questions:
  - content: You want to modify the pipeline YAML file so that it follows best practices. What should you do?
    choices:
    - content: Update the pipeline's `pool` to use a Windows agent pool.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. You don't need to change the operating system for your pipeline's agent pool.
    - content: Add variables for the service connection name, resource group name, and the environment type parameter.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. It's good practice to use variables for these values.
    - content: Add a `job` declaration before `steps`.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. When you have a single job in the pipeline, you can safely omit the `job` declaration.
  - content: Which of these situations will trigger the R&D team's pipeline to run?
    choices:
    - content: Someone commits an update to the *README.md* file in the *templates* directory in the *main* branch.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. The *templates/README.md* file is excluded by a path filter.
    - content: Someone commits an update to any file anywhere in the repository, and pushes the update to a branch with a name starting with **releases/**.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. Changes to the _templates/README.md_ file won't trigger the pipeline, because that filename is excluded by a path filter.
    - content: Someone commits an update to the *template.bicep* file in the *templates* directory and pushes the update to a branch with a name that starts with *releases/*.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. The *templates/template.bicep* file matches the `include` path filter, and it doesn't match the `exclude` path filter. Also, any branch name that starts with *releases/* is included in the branch trigger.
  - content: Which of the following statements is true?
    choices:
    - content: Before you run your pipeline with a Microsoft-hosted agent, you need to make sure the agent has started. When the pipeline run is finished, you need to shut down the agent so that it doesn't use up any resources unnecessarily.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. You don't need to start or stop Microsoft-hosted agents. Azure Pipelines manages the agents for you.
    - content: Microsoft-hosted agents contain all the software that's needed to deploy Bicep files.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. Microsoft-hosted agents include a set of predefined software, and it includes Bicep.
    - content: When your pipeline is finished running, you can sign in to the Microsoft-hosted agent machine to check the logs of the pipeline run.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. Microsoft-hosted agents exist only during the lifetime of your pipeline run. When the pipeline is finished, the agent is no longer available and can't be accessed. If you want to see the logs of your pipeline run, use the Azure Pipelines web interface.
  - content: You have a Bicep file that deploys a new App Service plan and an app to a resource group in Azure. Which of the following tasks can you use to deploy the Bicep file?
    choices:
    - content: The *Azure Web App* task.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. The *Azure Web App* task deploys application code to a web application that's already deployed. It doesn't deploy the App Service resources.
    - content: The *Copy Files* task.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. The *Copy Files* task doesn't perform any deployments  to Azure.
    - content: The *Azure Resource Group Deployment* task.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. You can use the *Azure Resource Group Deployment* task to execute a deployment of a Bicep file.
