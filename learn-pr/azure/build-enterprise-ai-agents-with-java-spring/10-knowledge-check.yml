  questions:
    - content: Which Spring AI component is used for generating vector embeddings?
      choices:
        - content: ChatClient
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: ChatClient isn't correct. The ChatClient offers a fluent API for communicating with AI models.
        - content: EmbeddingModel
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: Correct. EmbeddingModel is an interface for integration with embedding models in AI and can be used for generating vector embeddings.
        - content: QuestionAnswerAdvisor
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: While QuestionAnswerAdvisor uses vector embeddings for vector similarity search, it can't be used directly for generating embeddings.
        - content: AIClient
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: AIClient isn't a valid Spring AI component.
    - content: What PostgreSQL extension is required for vector similarity search?
      choices:
        - content: pg_similarity
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: The pg_similarity extension isn't used for vector similarity search.
        - content: pg_trgm
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: The pg_trgm extension isn't used for vector similarity search.
        - content: pgvector
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: Correct. The pgvector extension adds vector similarity search capabilities to PostgreSQL, which is essential for implementing RAG patterns with vector embeddings.
        - content: pg_vector_ops
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: The pg_vector_ops extension isn't used for vector similarity search.
    - content: Which Azure Container Apps feature enables automatic scaling based on HTTP traffic?
      choices:
        - content: HTTP Scale Rules
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: Correct. HTTP Scale Rules in Azure Container Apps enable automatic scaling based on incoming HTTP request concurrency.
        - content: Traffic Manager
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Traffic Manager isn't used for automatic scaling based on HTTP traffic.
        - content: Load Balancer
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Load Balancer isn't used for automatic scaling based on HTTP traffic.
        - content: Application Gateway
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Application Gateway isn't used for automatic scaling based on HTTP traffic.
    - content: What is the purpose of the ChatClient in Spring AI?
      choices:
        - content: Managing database connections
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: The ChatClient isn't used for managing database connections.
        - content: Processing HTTP requests
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: The ChatClient isn't used for processing HTTP requests.
        - content: Interacting with language models
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: Correct. The ChatClient is Spring AI's core abstraction for interacting with large language models (LLMs) like Azure OpenAI.
        - content: Handling authentication
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: The ChatClient isn't used for handling authentication.
    - content: Which configuration is required for Azure OpenAI integration in application.properties?
      choices:
        - content: Only the API key
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: The API key isn't sufficient for Azure OpenAI integration.
        - content: Only the endpoint URL
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: The endpoint URL isn't sufficient for Azure OpenAI integration.
        - content: Only the deployment name
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: The deployment name isn't sufficient for Azure OpenAI integration.
        - content: The API key, endpoint, and deployment name
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: Correct. Spring AI requires the API key, endpoint URL, and deployment name to properly configure Azure OpenAI integration.
    - content: Which Agentic workflow uses multiple AI roles to improve content quality?
      choices:
        - content: The Chain workflow
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: The Chain workflow breaks complex tasks into a series of steps
        - content: The Evaluator-Optimizer workflow
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: The Evaluator-Optimizer workflow uses writer and editor AI roles in a feedback loop to improve content quality.
        - content: The Routing workflow
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: The Routing workflow directs input to specialized handlers
        - content: The Parallelization workflow
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: The Parallelization workflow is ideal for processing large volumes of independent items.
