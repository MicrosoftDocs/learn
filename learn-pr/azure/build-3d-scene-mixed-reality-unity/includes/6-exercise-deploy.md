Now that you've built the base terrain for your wind-farm experience, it's time to see what you've created! You can build the project for HoloLens 2 and Windows Mixed Reality, or experience it directly from the Unity editor. If you have a Windows Mixed Reality device set up with your PC, selecting the **Play** button in the Unity editor launches the application to your headset. If you don't have a HoloLens 2 or mixed-reality device, selecting the **Play** button in the Unity editor lets you interact with your application via the MRTK interaction simulator. For this module, we showcase how to deploy your application for HoloLens 2. After you've checked out your application, return to build out more functionality into your Mixed Reality experience.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When adjusting your build settings, be sure to **Add Open Scenes** if your Scene doesn't appear in the **Scenes in Build**. Then, be sure to select the Scene of interest before adjusting settings.  Select **Universal Windows Platform** as the target Platform.

Once your app has been deployed, you can put on your HoloLens 2 and begin testing the experience.  The **Start** menu on HoloLens is where you'll open apps, see important status info, and access tools like the camera. You can open your app from the **Start** menu by selecting the **BladeMR** app tile.  You can also say the name of the app to open it, provided your [language is supported for the HoloLens 2](/hololens/hololens2-language-support). Navigate the experience and test the functionality you developed.

## Launch the HoloLens experience

1. Put on your HoloLens 2 device.
2. Launch the app if you haven't already.

## Place terrain

1. When the app first opens, the map will be floating in front of you in the direction you're facing when you launch the app.
2. Grab the base of the map directly with your hands (near interaction) or by using the hand ray pointer (far interaction). The base of the map will turn a light blue when hovered.
3. Position the map on top of a suitable real-world surface. The hologram will remain anchored at this position.
4. Move around the hologram and observe it from any angle.

## Exit the app

1. To exit an app that uses an immersive view, use the **Start gesture** to bring up the **Start menu**, then select the Mixed reality **Home** button.
2. Once you've exited the app, close the app window using the **Close** icon in the top right of the window.

    > [!TIP]
    > You can launch or exit apps by voice or through gestures. For guidance on how to explore holograms and general usage, refer to [Getting around HoloLens 2](/hololens/hololens2-basic-usage).

After you're done testing your wind-farm experience, uninstall the app:

## Uninstall from the Start menu

1. On the **Start** menu or in the **All apps** list, browse to the app. Select and hold until the menu appears, then select **Uninstall**.

## Uninstall from Settings

1. On the **Start** menu, select **Settings** > **Apps**. Find the app from the list, select it, and select **Uninstall**.
