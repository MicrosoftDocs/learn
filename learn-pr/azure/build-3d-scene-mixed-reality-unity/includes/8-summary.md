Building an immersive Digital Twin Mixed Reality experience for mixed reality takes careful thought and planning. Although you might be tempted to move directly into writing code and configuring tools, the overall user experience is improved if you consider design elements such as contextual information requirements, asset placement and distances, and user interface/user experience design elements. 

You can source Scene data from different locations, and that data varies depending on many considerations ranging from data availability, currency, scalability, and so on. For some experiences, static terrain is a logical choice, particularly when handling sensitive data or disconnected experiences. For other experiences, you might consider data services such as Bing Maps to provide evergreen data that scales across regions and provides consistency.  

Experiencing Digital Twins inside the Unity editor can be useful, but you can realize a more immersive experience when you deploy your app to the HoloLens 2 or Mixed Reality.
