quiz:
  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:

  - content: "Which of the following queues should you use if you need FIFO message order and support for transactions?"
    choices:
    - content: 'Azure Service Bus queues'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Azure Service Bus queues by default handle messages in the same order messages are added, and they also support transactions. This means that if one message in a transaction fails to be added to the queue, all messages in the transaction aren't added."
    - content: 'Azure Storage queues'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Even though a queue by default is a FIFO data structure, Azure Storage queues don't guarantee FIFO because other settings or system interruptions might preempt message order."
    
  - content: "Suppose you're sending a message with Azure Service Bus and you want multiple components to receive it. Which Azure Service Bus feature should you use?"
    choices:
    - content: 'An Azure Service Bus queue.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A queue can have only one destination component at a time, which means that each message in the queue is delivered to only one receiver."
    - content: 'An Azure Service Bus topic.'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. A topic allows multiple destination components to subscribe. This means that each message can be delivered to multiple receivers."

  - content: "True or false: You can add a message that's 20 MB in size to an Azure Service Bus queue."
    choices:
    - content: 'True'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. If you use the premium tier, you can send messages up to 100 MB in size. For the standard tier, the limit is 256 KB."
    - content: 'False'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. If you use the premium tier, you can send messages up to 100 MB in size. For the standard tier, the limit is 256 KB."
