Microsoft Entra ID Protection gives you advanced detection and remediation of identity-based risks to protect your Microsoft Entra identities and applications.

You work for a retail organization that has its identities stored in Microsoft Entra ID. There have been several recent incidents where identities were compromised. It's possible that sensitive customer information was exposed. You'd like to use Azure native services to protect your company from any future incidents. You've decided to use Identity Protection to protect your identity infrastructure.

In this module, you explore what Identity Protection is and how to use it. First, you detect risks by using risk policies. Then, you investigate detected risks and remediate them.

Our goal is that by the end of this module, you know how to protect your organization's identities from identity-based risks by using Identity Protection.
