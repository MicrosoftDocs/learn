It's important to be able to scale a web app for these reasons:

- It enables the app to remain responsive during periods of high demand.
- It helps to save you money by reducing the resources required when demand drops.

Azure App Service enables you to meet these goals by providing scale up and down, and scale in and out.

Imagine that you work for a large chain of hotels. You have a website that customers can visit to make bookings and to view the details of bookings that they previously made. At certain times of the year, the volume of traffic grows because customers are browsing hotels for summer vacations. At other times, traffic declines. These patterns are predictable.

In this module, you use Azure App Service to scale a web app to match planned seasonal throughput requirements and also meet demand during short-term peak events. This module also describes how to scale up a web app onto more powerful hardware to meet future requirements.
