
Deploy Microsoft Azure Sentinel and connect it to data sources to provide real-time analysis for security alerts throughout an enterprise.

Contoso, Ltd. is a midsize financial services company in London with a branch office in New York City. Contoso uses Microsoft 365, Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), Azure AD Identity Protection, Cloud App Security, Azure Advanced Threat Protection (Azure ATP), Microsoft Defender Advanced Threat Protection (Microsoft Defender ATP), Microsoft Office 365 Advanced Threat Protection, Intune, and Microsoft Azure Information Protection.

Contoso uses the free cloud security posture management capabilities of Azure Security Center. However, Contoso plans to move to the standard paid version to get threat protection for resources that run on Azure and on-premises. The company also has other non-Microsoft assets to monitor and protect.

Security analysts at Contoso face a huge triage burden. They deal with a high volume of alerts from multiple products. They correlate alerts in the following ways:

- Manually from different product dashboards
- By using a traditional correlation engine

Additionally, the time spent to set up and maintain IT infrastructure takes the security operations (SecOps) team away from its security tasks.

The IT director believes that Azure Sentinel will help the security analysts perform complex investigations faster and improve their SecOps.

As Contoso's lead system engineer and Azure administrator, you've been asked to set up a proof-of-concept trial environment. This trial will verify whether Azure Sentinel can help the Contoso SecOps team efficiently identify and stop cyber attacks before they cause harm.
