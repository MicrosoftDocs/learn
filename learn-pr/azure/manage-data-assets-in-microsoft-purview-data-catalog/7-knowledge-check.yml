    - content: "Scans resources and houses metadata about the assets in those resources."

    - content: "Any single object that is stored within a Microsoft Purview Data Catalog."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct - A single object in the catalog could potentially represent many objects in storage, for example, a resource set is an asset but it's made up of many partition files in storage."
    - content: "The resource location where data is stored."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect - "This is called the 'source' in Microsoft Purview, and is registered and scanned in the data map."
    - content: "A defining term that is attached to a piece of data in Microsoft Purview to provide descriptive context."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect - Classifications, glossary terms, and sensitivity labels are applied to assets to define and provide context."
  - content: "What's a certified asset?"
    choices:
    - content: "An asset that has been vetted and marked as certified by the Microsoft Purview Data Catalog."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect - The Microsoft Purview Data Catalog is only an index and doesn't evaluate the quality of your data assets or their annotations."
    - content: "An asset that has been reviewed by a data steward and marked as certified for use."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct - Currently, the certification process only involves being marked by a data steward, and certification is up to those individuals."
    - content: "An asset that has lineage data for both source and destination of the asset."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect - Lineage data is useful, but not required, and an asset won't be automatically certified when lineage information is added."
