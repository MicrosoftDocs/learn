In this module, you learned how your company can take advantage of its existing Java and Maven development skills and apply that knowledge using Microsoft Azure to create serverless Azure functions. Using your existing development tools, you created an Azure Function application using a Maven archetype that uses an HTTP trigger to capture data. You saw how to test your function application locally and in the cloud using a web browser, with a minimal amount of Azure knowledge. In order to gather detailed information, you added custom logging functionality to your application code and redeployed your function to Azure. Then, you learned how to use Log Streaming and Application Insights to analyze your application in real time.

The Maven Plugin for Azure Functions enables your development team to rely on technologies that they have experience with. Allowing them to simplify the end to end process of creating, developing, and deploying applications to Azure. And when your application is deployed, Azure provides you with a wealth of tools to monitor your application's health.
