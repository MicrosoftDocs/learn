You can use Azure Functions and Azure API Management to build complete APIs with a microservices architecture.

Suppose you work for an online store with a successful and busy web site. Your developers wrote the business logic for the site as microservices in the form of Azure Functions. Now, you want to enable partners to interact with your online store from their own code by creating a web API that they can call over HTTP. You want to find an easy way to assemble your functions into a single API.

In this module, you learn how to use API Management to assemble multiple microservices, implemented as Azure Functions, into an integrated web API.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you will:

- Identify the value of Azure API Management in a serverless application.
- Import an Azure Function App as an API in Azure API Management.
- Import multiple Azure Function apps as a single API in Azure API Management.

## Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of Azure API Management and Azure Functions.
