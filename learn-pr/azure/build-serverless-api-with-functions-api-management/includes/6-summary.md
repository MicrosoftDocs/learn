In this module, you published a serverless API with two Azure Functions apps in an instance of Azure API Management. This approach enables you to implement a microservices architecture by coding Azure Functions as serverless components. API Management assembles these microservices into a single API product using a single URL, all while generating consistent behavior imposed by using API Management policies.
