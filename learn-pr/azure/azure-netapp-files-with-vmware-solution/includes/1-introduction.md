Azure VMware Solution is a great way to extend or move VMware workloads to Azure without refactoring or rearchitecting. Though Azure VMware Solution includes vSAN datastores to store your virtual machines (VMs), there are several scenarios where it might make sense to extend the storage footprint of your Azure VMware Solution clusters without adding Azure VMware Solution hosts. Storage solutions such as Azure NetApp Files allow you to provision performant and highly available storage directly to Azure VMware Solution hosts. These solutions allow you to increase datastore capacity or connect directly to Azure VMware Solution guest VMs to provide shared file systems to various workloads.

Azure NetApp Files uses NetApp technology to provide significant data protection and disaster recovery features for your mission-critical workloads in an Azure native storage service. Using Azure VMware Solution with Azure NetApp Files can also scale your on-premises operation to the cloud with an easy-to-use interface and a lower total cost of ownership.

This learning module helps you understand when and how to configure Azure NetApp Files with Azure VMware Solution to optimize scale and performance.

In this guide, we explore:

- Why use Azure NetApp Files with Azure VMware Solution?
