Azure Hybrid Benefit helps organizations maximize savings when migrating and modernizing their cloud infrastructure through pricing discounts and deployment benefits.

## Example scenario

Contoso, a leading healthcare software provider, is facing challenges in managing their on-premises infrastructure. With an increasing demand for their services and the need for a more scalable and cost-effective solution, Contoso has decided to migrate their on-premises infrastructure to the cloud. They have chosen Azure for its comprehensive hybrid cloud capabilities and decided to leverage Azure Hybrid Benefit to optimize their costs.

Challenges faced by Contoso include:

- High operational costs associated with maintaining on-premises servers.
- Limited scalability to manage peak loads and a growing customer base.
- Need for enhanced security and compliance with healthcare regulations.

To address these challenges, Contoso has decided to leverage Azure Hybrid Benefit and apply it to its Windows Server and SQL Server Licenses. By doing so, they intend to significantly reduce their cloud migration costs and allocate savings towards modernizing their infrastructure.
