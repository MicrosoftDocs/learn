  - content: Assume that you're running a Windows Server 2022-based VM in Azure, with D8as_v6 size, in the East US region. The monthly cost of this virtual machine is 533.63 dollars, which results in 0.731 dollar per hour (on a 730 hours per month basis). Assume that a 3-year reservation reduces the hourly rate to 0.55 dollar per hour and that Azure Hybrid Benefit reduces the cost by 50 percent. When these two benefits are combined, how much will you save on a monthly basis and on a yearly basis?
    choices:
    - content: "Savings per month: 290.5 dollars, savings per year: 3,486 dollars."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This is incorrect. The monthly cost of this VM when a 3-year Azure reservation is applied is reduced to: $401.50 ($0.55 per hour x 730 hours) . With Azure Hybrid Benefit applied, the monthly cost of this VM is reduced to: $266.81 ($0.3655 per hour x 730 hours). When both are applied, the VM's monthly cost is reduced to: $200.75 ($0.275 per hour x 730 hours.). Savings per month is $533.63 - $200.75, which results in $332,88 per month, and $3994,56 per year."
