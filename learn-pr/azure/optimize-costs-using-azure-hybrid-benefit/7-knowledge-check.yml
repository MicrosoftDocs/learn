  - content: Assume that you're running a Windows Server 2022-based VM in Azure, with D8as_v6 size, in the East US region. The monthly cost of this virtual machine is '$533.63', which results in '$0.731' per hour (on a 730 hours per month basis). Assume that a 3-year reservation reduces the hourly rate to '$0.55' per hour and that Azure Hybrid Benefit reduces the cost by 50 percent. When these two benefits are combined, how much will you save on a monthly basis and on a yearly basis?
    choices:
    - content: "Savings per month: '$290.5', savings per year: '$3,486'."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This is incorrect. The monthly cost of this VM when a 3-year Azure reservation is applied is reduced to: $401.50 ($0.55 per hour x 730 hours) . With Azure Hybrid Benefit applied, the monthly cost of this VM is reduced to: $266.81 ($0.3655 per hour x 730 hours). When both are applied, the VM's monthly cost is reduced to: $200.75 ($0.275 per hour x 730 hours.). Savings per month is $533.63 - $200.75, which results in $332,88 per month, and $3994,56 per year."
    - content: "Savings per month: '$332.88', savings per year: '$3994.56'."
