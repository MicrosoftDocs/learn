Imagine you're building a photo-sharing application. Every day, thousands of users take pictures and rely on your application to keep their photos safe while making them accessible across all their devices. Storing these photos is critical to your business, and you want to assure users that the system used in your application is fast, reliable, and secure. Ideally, you could do this without having to build all these aspects into the app.

Azure Storage provides such power, resiliency, and performance in the cloud. This module provides instructions about using the power of Azure Storage to achieve the reliability and performance that you require in your app. You can then apply this knowledge to any application.

## Learning objectives

- Explore the data types and services supported by an Azure storage account.
- Create a new Azure storage account using the Azure portal.
