Azure DNS Private Resolver is a highly available cloud-native and DevOps-friendly service. It provides a simple, zero-maintenance, reliable, and secure DNS service to resolve and conditionally forward DNS queries from a virtual network, on-premises, and to other target DNS servers without the need to create and manage a custom DNS solution. Resolve DNS names hosted in Azure Private DNS zones from on-premises networks and DNS queries for your own domain names.

Your DNS infrastructure works privately and seamlessly across on-premises networks, and it enables key hybrid networking scenarios.
