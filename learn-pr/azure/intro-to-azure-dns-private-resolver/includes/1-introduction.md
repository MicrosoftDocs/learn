The domain name system (DNS) is a critical design topic in the overall landing zone architecture. Implementing a DNS solution on Azure through virtual machines could require too much effort in comparison with a native solution, running on top of the Azure platform.

Azure DNS Private Resolver bridges on-premises DNS namespaces with private DNS zones hosted on Azure DNS without the burden of deploying VM-based custom DNS servers. You can resolve DNS queries from on-premises networks and do conditional forwarding to on-premises DNS zones.

## What will we be doing?

In this module, you'll learn how to use Azure DNS Private Resolver to resolve DNS queries from on-premises to cloud.

## What is the main goal?

You'll be able understand details about Azure DNS Private Resolver, how it works, and when to use it.
