Some business processes are simple, but they often include challenges such as:

- They might involve many different steps, sometimes with loops or conditional branches.
- They may be long-running and complete over days or weeks as staff become available or because of other delays.
- They may involve several different systems such as databases, web services, email servers, and other components.
- You may want to integrate a custom or third-party system, which may require a custom connector.
- You may want non-developers to be able to modify and update the workflow.

As you've seen, Azure includes the following technologies that you can use to overcome these challenges:

- Microsoft Power Automate
- Azure Logic Apps
- Azure Functions
- Azure App Service WebJobs

Your choice of technology depends on whether you prefer a design-first or a code-first approach, and whether you have skilled developers to work on the project.
