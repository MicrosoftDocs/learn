Read the following scenarios and then answer the following questions:

## Scenario 1 - TV Adverts

You work for a company that makes TV adverts. You want to formalize two business processes:

- **The advert review process.** A completed advert is put through this editorial process to ensure that it meets the standards of taste, decency, grammar, style, and legal requirements in the jurisdiction where it will be broadcast.
- **The feedback collection process.** A completed advert is also put through this process in which  customers, the director, and members of the board of directors can give feedback.

The advert review process should be managed by members of the creative team, because it will need to change regularly. The creative team would prefer not to have to wait for a developer to become available whenever a change is needed.

The feedback collection process calls an on-premises SharePoint server. Because this server isn't as reliable as a cloud-based server, developers want to carefully control the way the workflow retries this connection when there's a failure.

## Scenario 2 - Camera Company Merger

You work for a company that makes digital cameras. The company has recently acquired a smaller company that makes lenses. You want to ensure that the same procedures are in use throughout the company for the following processes:

- **Lens quality control.** The company you acquired has a good reputation for lens reliability because of its quality control procedure. You want to implement this procedure across the merged company and integrate it with your parts ordering system, which includes a REST API.
- **Ordering and dispatch.** The company you acquired had no formal order and dispatch procedure, so you want to ensure its employees use your original business procedure. The ordering system has a user interface that is built as an Azure App Service web app but you want to manage the order and dispatch workflow as a separate project.

You've hired a small team of developers to do the work and you prefer a design-first approach.
