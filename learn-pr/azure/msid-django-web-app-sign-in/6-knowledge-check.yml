    - content: "The app sends an authorization code to Azure AD."
      isCorrect: false

    choices:
    - content: "Tenant ID, application ID, and application secret."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The redirect URI is also required because Azure AD needs to know where to redirect the user after a successful sign-in."
    - content: "Tenant ID, application ID, application secret, and redirect URI."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The tenant ID is the ID of your Azure AD directory. The application ID is the unique autogenerated ID of the app. The client secret is used in exchanging the authorization code for an access token. And the redirect URI is where the user is redirected to after successful sign-in."
    - content: "Application ID, application secret, and redirect URI."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The tenant ID is also required when you're setting the authority in the Azure AD configuration."

    choices:
    - content: "It's the location where the authorization server sends the user after successful sign-in."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The redirect URI is the location where the authorization server sends the user after successful sign-in. A successful request to this endpoint contains an authorization code."
    - content: "It's the location where the user is prompted for credentials to sign in."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The redirect URI isn't where the user enters credentials."
    - content: "The user sends the authorization code to the redirect endpoint after signing in."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The authorization server sends the authorization code to the redirect URI after successful sign-in."
