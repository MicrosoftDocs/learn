  questions:
  - content: "When you're using linked templates, where can you store the linked artifacts?"
    choices:
    - content: "On a networked server accessible over Server Message Block (SMB)."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "When you're referencing a linked template, you can't use a local file or a file that's available only on your local network."
    - content: "On any endpoint that's publicly accessible through HTTP or HTTPS."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "When you're referencing a linked template, you must provide a URI value that's downloadable as HTTP or HTTPS."
    - content: "On any endpoint that's publicly accessible through FTP."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "When you're referencing a linked template, you must provide a URI value that's downloadable as HTTP or HTTPS."
  - content: "When you're deploying a template through GitHub Actions, you must provide authentication credentials in what form?" 
    choices:
    - content: "Provide a username and template as part of a configured secret in GitHub repository settings."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "You can automate your workflow to do an Azure sign-in by using an Azure service principal."
    - content: "Use the user credentials part of a configured secret in GitHub repository settings."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "You can provide the service principal credentials part of a configured secret in your GitHub repository settings."
    - content: "Provide the shared access signature (SAS) part of a configured secret in GitHub repository settings."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Shared access signatures or SAS tokens are used to provide secure delegated access to resources in your storage account without compromising the security of your data."
  - content: "What's the best way to modularize your resources for deployment?" 
    choices:
    - content: "Use nested templates."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Nested templates allow you to store many individual templates in one main template file. But each file can't be reused as easily as if separate files were linked together."
    - content: "Use linked templates."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Linked templates allow you to create reusable, composable, and modular deployments that comprise many individual ARM templates."
    - content: "Use GitHub Actions to control the deployment."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "GitHub Actions are a great way to deploy your infrastructure as code (IaC) in a controlled manner, but they don't provide any benefits to modularize your templates."
