  title: Enable network access to an application
  description: Explore how to expose your application to clients outside your Azure Kubernetes Service cluster by using services and ingresses. You see how to make use of ingress rules and annotations to specify the routing of requests and the selection of an ingress controller.

  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
    - content: "What's the purpose of the ClusterIP service type?"
      choices:
        - content: "To freeze the cluster's IP so that we can access it directly."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "The cluster's IP is already a fixed IP present in the Azure Kubernetes Service dashboard."
        - content: "To make services available to other Azure Kubernetes Service clusters within the Azure network."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Services don't work across clusters. Their work is focused on their current cluster."
        - content: "To group pods into one single IP that's only available within the cluster."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct. Services of that type expose the selected pods internally."

    - content: "What's the purpose of the LoadBalancer service type?"
      choices:
        - content: "To expose the service externally by using Azure's load-balancing solution."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct. Services of that type expose the selected pods externally by using an Azure Load Balancer solution."
        - content: "To balance the flow of internal communication in the cluster."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Services don't interfere with cluster traffic."
        - content: "To group several different pods into a reverse proxy that's used internally in the cluster."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "It's not possible to group different pods and differentiate them by using their IPs as a reverse proxy. That's how an ingress controller works."

    - content: "What is an ingress?"
      choices:
        - content: "A workload to create DNS zone records in Azure via API access to the cloud."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Despite triggering the event that causes the creation of new DNS zones, an ingress isn't meant for that."
        - content: "A workload to define the set of rules that allow external applications into the cluster."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct. Ingress defines a set of rules to allow external applications into the cluster."
        - content: "Groups pods into one single IP address so they don't lose their IPs when they're destroyed."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "That's not the job of the ingress. It's the purpose of the service."
