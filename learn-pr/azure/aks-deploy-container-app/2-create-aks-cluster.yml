  questions:
    - content: "Which are examples of kubernetes cluster architectures?"
      choices:
        - content: "Single control plane, several nodes."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "This is the most common case of Kubernetes architecture, where you have one control plane and several nodes to support the workloads."
        - content: "Several control planes, single node."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "While it is possible to do so, it isn't recommended and it doesn't make sense to have one single node in a cluster."
        - content: "No nodes, only control plane."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "The control plane node cannot receive workloads. Therefore, there can't be a single control plane."

    - content: "What are node pools?"
      choices:
        - content: "A configuration to create multiple node types in the same cluster."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "You can have several nodes with different sizes in different Node Pools across your cluster. You can even tell applications and pods to spin up in nodes according to their characteristics."
        - content: "A place to store the nodes you will create in the future without paying."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Node pools indeed store nodes, but they're not storages."
        - content: "An Azure resource that allows for node sharing between clusters."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Node pools are not Azure resources."

    - content: "What does the HTTP Application Routing Addon do?"
      choices:
        - content: "Allows for internal routing of HTTP applications amongst Kubernetes' nodes."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "The concept of allowing routes is correct, but it does not do so internally."
        - content: "Logs all routing messages from HTTP workloads"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "This addon is not meant to do that, instead, it is connected to networking."
        - content: "Allows for instant exposing of an app to external network when creating ingresses."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "HTTP Application Routing allows you to instantly expose workloads to the web!"
