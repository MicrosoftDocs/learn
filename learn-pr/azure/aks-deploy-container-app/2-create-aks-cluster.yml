  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
    - content: "Which of the following describes a Kubernetes cluster architecture?"
      choices:
        - content: "Single control plane, several nodes."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "This is the most common Kubernetes architecture, where you have one control plane and several nodes to support the workloads."
        - content: "Several control planes, single node."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "While it's possible to do so, it isn't recommended, and it doesn't make sense to have one single node in a cluster."
        - content: "No nodes, only control plane."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "The control plane node can't receive workloads, so there can't be a single control plane."

    - content: "What are node pools?"
      choices:
        - content: "A configuration to create multiple node types in the same cluster."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "You can have several nodes with different sizes in different node pools across your cluster. You can even tell applications and pods to spin up in nodes according to their characteristics."
        - content: "A place to store the nodes you'll create in the future without paying."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Node pools do store nodes, but they're not storage."
        - content: "An Azure resource that allows for node sharing between clusters."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Node pools aren't Azure resources."
