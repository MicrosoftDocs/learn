  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: 'What do TPR and FPR mean?'
    choices:
    - content: "TPR is the number of correct responses. FPR is the number of incorrect responses."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect."
    - content: "TPR is the proportion of answers that were provided correctly as 'true'. FPR is the proportion of answers that were provided incorrectly as 'true'."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct."
    - content: "TPR is the proportion of answers that were provided correctly as 'true'. FPR is the proportion of answers that were provided incorrectly as 'false'."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect."
  - content: 'What are on the X and Y axes in an ROC plot?'
    choices:
    - content: 'X-axis: FP rate, Y-axis: TP rate'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct."
    - content: "X-axis: Number of FPs, Y-axis: Number of TPs"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. "
    - content: "X-axis: Number of TPs, Y-axis: Number of FPs"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect."
  - content: 'What does area under the curve for an ROC plot tell us?'
    choices:
    - content: "How well the model works at its optimum decision threshold"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This information might be obtainable from the ROC plot but we can't get this information from the AUC."
    - content: "Which is the optimum decision threshold?"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. AUC is a summary metric that is too simplified to provide this information."
    - content: "It gives a summary of how well a model works across various thresholds."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct."
