The **trust boundary element** is represented by dotted lines or squares. Trust boundaries are used to describe data flow as it crosses different trust zone levels.

Examples include:

- Firewalls
- Connections to third-party services
- Parts of your system only available to administrators

Areas with changing trust zones are the most targeted by attackers and should be carefully designed.

Microsoft has predefined trust-zone requirements for engineers to use internally. It takes the guesswork out of which boundaries to apply. If you work at Microsoft, contact your security team to learn more.

## When to use the trust boundary element

Here are a few important points to remember about trust boundaries:

- Include trust boundaries to handle data flow as it crosses different trust zones.
- Trust boundary **lines** represent data flow as it crosses large environments, like the internet.
- Trust boundary **boxes** represent smaller environments, like sandbox environments and corporate networks.

## Include context

Include the following context with each trust boundary element:
