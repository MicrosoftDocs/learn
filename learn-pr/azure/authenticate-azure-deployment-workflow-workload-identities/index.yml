title: Authenticate your Azure deployment workflow by using workload identities
summary: |
  Workload identities enable your deployment workflows to authenticate securely with Azure without you managing any passwords, keys, or secrets.
  In this module, you'll learn what workload identities are, how they work, and how to create them.
  You'll also learn how to grant them permission to your Azure resources so that your workflows can deploy your Bicep files.
