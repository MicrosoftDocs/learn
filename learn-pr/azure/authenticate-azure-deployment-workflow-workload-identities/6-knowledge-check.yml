  questions:
  - content: What should your colleague do to fix this error?
    choices:
    - content: Add the `permissions` property to the workflow definition.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. The error message indicates that the workflow doesn't have permissions to work with tokens.
    - content: Move the client ID, tenant ID, and subscription ID inputs into GitHub secrets.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. You don't need to use GitHub secrets for the identifiers. The error message indicates that the workflow doesn't have permissions to work with tokens.
    - content: Use a service principal and a key.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. You don't need to use a key. The error message indicates that the workflow doesn't have permissions to work with tokens.
  - content: Which of these statements about workload identities is true?
    choices:
    - content: When you use workload identities, you must carefully manage their secrets.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. Federated credentials enable deployment workflows to securely authenticate to Microsoft Entra ID without you storing any secrets.
    - content: Workload identities can use federated credentials to authenticate.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. Federated credentials enable deployment workflows to securely authenticate to Microsoft Entra ID without you storing any secrets.
    - content: Workload identities must be created through the Azure portal.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. Workload identities and federated credentials can be created through the Azure CLI, Azure PowerShell, or the Azure portal.
  - content: You need to create a deployment workflow that deploys your infrastructure to three environments - development, test, and production. Each environment is in a dedicated resource group in three subscriptions. What should you do?
    choices:
    - content: Create a single workload identity and grant it access to the tenant root management group.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. Although this will work, using a single workload identity for all of your environments is not a good practice. Additionally, granting access to your tenant root management group will allow the workload identity to modify resources anywhere in your Azure environment, which is unnecessarily permissive.
    - content: Create a single workload identity and grant it access to each of the resource groups in the three subscriptions.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. Although this will work, using a single workload identity for all of your environments is not a good practice. At the very least, you should separate production and non-production environments by using two workload identities. But a dedicated workload identity for each environment is ideal.
    - content: Create three workload identities, one per environment, and grant each identity access to a single resource group in the relevant subscription.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. When you work with multiple environments, it's best to use dedicated workload identities for each environment so that your deployment workflow can't accidentally change anything in another environment.
  - content: You're creating a workload identity to run a deployment workflow. The workflow deploys a Bicep file that creates a single storage account. Which of the following options has the least privileged access that you need for your workflow?
    choices:
    - content: |
        **Role definition:** Contributor<br />
        **Scope:** Subscription
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. The Contributor role is a good one to use. However, you should avoid granting it over the subscription scope unless you need to. In this case, you don't.
    - content: |
        **Role definition:** Contributor<br />
        **Scope:** Resource group
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. The Contributor role is a good one to use. Granting it over the resource group is a good practice and is all that this workflow needs.
    - content: |
        **Role definition:** Owner<br />
        **Scope:** Resource group
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. This role assignment is too permissive. You should avoid granting the Owner role unless it's required. In this example, it's not.
