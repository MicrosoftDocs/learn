      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Azure DNS uses role-based access control and activity logs, but Azure Security Manager handles infrastructure security.
  - content: What type of DNS record should you create to map one or more IP addresses against a single domain?

      explanation: The CNAME record maps a domain name to another domain name.
    - content: A or AAAA
