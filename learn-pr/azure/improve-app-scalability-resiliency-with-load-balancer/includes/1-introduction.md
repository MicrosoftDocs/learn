Many apps need to be resilient to failure and scale easily when demand increases. You can address those needs by using Azure Load Balancer.

Suppose you work for a healthcare organization that's launching a new portal application with which patients can schedule appointments. The application has a patient portal, a web-application front end, and a business-tier database. The front end uses the database to retrieve and save patient information.

The new portal needs to be available around the clock to handle failures. The portal must adjust to load fluctuations by adding and removing resources to match the load. The organization needs a solution that distributes work to virtual machines across the system as virtual machines are added. The solution should detect failures and reroute jobs to virtual machines as needed. Improved resiliency and scalability help ensure that patients can schedule appointments from any location.

By the end of this module, you'll be able to use Azure Load Balancer to build a resilient and scalable app architecture.
