In this module, you learned about Azure Application Gateway, a service that allows you to manage the requests that client applications can send to a web app. You learned that Application Gateway routes traffic to a pool of web servers based on the URL of a request. The pool of web servers can be Azure virtual machines, Azure virtual machine scale sets, Azure App Service, and even on-premises servers. You learned that Application Gateway provides features such as load balancing HTTP traffic, a web application firewall, and support for TLS/SSL encryption of your data. You also learned that Application Gateway supports encrypting traffic between users and an application gateway, and between application servers and an application gateway.
