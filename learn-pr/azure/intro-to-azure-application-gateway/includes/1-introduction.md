Azure Application Gateway is an Azure service that processes traffic to web apps that are hosted on a pool of web servers. The processing performed by Azure Application Gateway includes load balancing HTTP traffic and inspecting traffic using web application firewall. It also includes encrypting traffic between users and an application gateway, and encrypting traffic between application servers and an application gateway.

Adatum is a new and expanding online commerce store that sells industrial drones. You're responsible for networking at the company. Adatum has several web applications that are hosted on computers in its on-premises datacenter. At the moment, a special but aging hardware device is deployed on the Adatum perimeter network that manages traffic to the web applications hosted on these computers. You want to retire this device and have traffic mediated by an Azure service.

To meet your goals, you need to ensure that the Azure service replicates the functionality that the special hardware currently provides. Important functionality that must be present in the replacement service includes:

- Detect if one of the on-premises servers becomes unavailable so that traffic is no longer directed to it
- TLS termination functionality to reduce the amount of CPU capacity consumed by encryption and decryption operations
- Session affinity to ensure that the same back-end pool host always serves a client connection to a web application
- Security filtering of malicious traffic such as SQL injection and cross site scripting attacks

This module explains what Azure Application Gateway does, how it works, and when you should choose to use Azure Application Gateway as a solution to meet your organizationâ€™s needs.
