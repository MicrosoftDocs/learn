  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
    - content: Which of the following Azure Application Gateway features can protect web applications against SQL injection attacks?
      choices:
        - content: Health probes
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. Health probes allow the application gateway to determine which hosts in the back-end pool are no longer responding.
        - content: TLS/SSL termination
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. TLS/SSL termination offloads the encryption and decryption operations of TLS/SSL onto the application gateway.
        - content: Web application firewall
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: Correct. A web application firewall allows you to protect against SQL injection and other attacks.          
    - content: You have a back-end pool made up of four Azure infrastructure as a service (IaaS) virtual machines. Occasionally, one or more of these virtual machines might become temporarily unresponsive. You want to ensure that Application Gateway doesn't forward traffic to an unresponsive virtual machine, even if you're unaware that a problem exists. Which Application Gateway feature can prevent traffic from forwarding to an unresponsive virtual machine?
      choices: 
        - content: Health probes
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: Correct. Health probes allow the application gateway to determine which hosts in the back-end pool are no longer responding.          
        - content: Web application firewall
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. A web application firewall allows you to protect against SQL injection and other attacks.          
        - content: Connection draining
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. Connection draining allows you to deregister an instance in a back-end pool so that it doesn't receive any new traffic. It doesn't detect whether an instance in the back-end pool is unresponsive.          
    - content: You have a back-end pool made up of eight Azure IaaS virtual machines. You need to install a new framework on each of these virtual machines. You don't want the virtual machine to participate in the back-end pool while you do this maintenance operation. You want to stop new connections from occurring on the VM that you're doing maintenance on, and you also want to allow any existing connections that are present to complete naturally. Which of the following Azure Application Gateway features can you use to accomplish this goal?
      choices:
        - content: Session affinity
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. Session affinity ensures that the same back-end pool host always serves a client connection to a web application.   
        - content: Connection draining
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: Correct. Connection draining allows you to deregister an instance in a back-end pool so that it doesn't receive any new traffic. Connection draining is useful in maintenance scenarios during which you want to gracefully remove traffic from a node.      
        - content: Health probes
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. Health probes allow the application gateway to determine which hosts in the back-end pool are no longer responding.
