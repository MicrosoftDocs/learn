quiz:
  questions:
  - content: "How many different types of parameters does Datacenter Firewall support for defining its rules?"
    choices:
    - content: "Five"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Datacenter Firewall can support five parameters: source and destination port numbers, source and destination IP addresses, and a protocol."
    - content: "Four"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Datacenter Firewall can use more than four parameters for defining its rules."
    - content: "Three"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Datacenter Firewall can use more than three parameters for defining its rules."
  - content: "Which type of object can you assign an access control list (ACL) in Datacenter Firewall?"
    choices:
    - content: "Logical network"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. You can't assign an ACL to a logical network."
    - content: "Virtual machine (VM)"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. You can assign an ACL to a VM network interface but not a VM."
    - content: "Network subnet"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. You can assign an ACL to a logical network subnet or a virtual network subnet."
  - content: "What's the most granular level to which you can assign Datacenter Firewall logging?"
    choices:
    - content: "An ACL rule"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. You can enable logging on individual ACL rules."
    - content: "An ACL"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. You can enable logging on individual ACL rules, but not an entire ACL."
    - content: "A network subnet"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. You can enable logging on individual ACL rules, not a network subnet."
  - content: "Which mechanism does Network Controller use to advertise virtual IPs (VIPs) assigned to Software Load Balancing Multiplexer VMs to datacenter routers?"
    choices:
    - content: "Border Gateway Protocol"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Network Controller assigns VIPs to Software Load Balancing Multiplexer VMs, which use Border Gateway Protocol to advertise VIPs to datacenter routers as individual /32 routes."
    - content: "Open Shortest Path First"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Azure Stack HCI software defined networking doesn't rely on Open Shortest Path First."
    - content: "Routing Information Protocol"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Azure Stack HCI software defined networking doesn't rely on Routing Information Protocol."
  - content: "Which layer of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model does software defined networking Software Load Balancing operate on?"
    choices:
    - content: "Layer 3"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Software defined networking Software Load Balancing doesn't provide Layer 3 load balancing."
    - content: "Layer 4"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Software defined networking Software Load Balancing provides Layer 4 load balancing for North-South and East-West TCP/UDP traffic."
    - content: "Layer 7"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Software defined networking Software Load Balancing doesn't provide Layer 7 load balancing."
  - content: "Which of the following tasks doesn't require creating a health probe object?"
    choices:
    - content: "Implementing inbound network address translation (NAT)"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. NAT doesn't rely on health probes because it doesn't distribute traffic based on the operational status of a target VM."
    - content: "Implementing internal load balancing"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Load balancing rules require the use of a health probe."
    - content: "Implementing external load balancing"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Load balancing rules require the use of a health probe."
