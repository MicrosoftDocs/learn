  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "What is a benefit of a machine learning pipeline?"
    choices:
    - content: "Machine learning pipelines create a dependent workflow process to ensure each stage of a workflow is tested and completed before moving on to the next stage."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Machine learning pipelines are independently executable workflows of complete machine learning tasks."
    - content: "Machine learning pipelines serve as an audit trail for a model’s history and make it possible to automatically trigger workflows after certain events."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Incorrect. This is a benefit of a model registry."
    - content: "Machine learning pipelines require data scientists to begin their work from the beginning to make changes, which improves their accuracy and performance."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Machine learning pipelines allow data scientists to start from where the change needs to occur, which prevents running costly and time-intensive steps like data ingestion."
    - content: "Having independent steps saved to a pipeline allows multiple data scientists to work on the same pipeline concurrently."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Machine learning pipelines allow data scientists to better collaborate and make changes more easily, which saves time and money."
  - content: "What is the recommended approach for monitoring machine learning models?"
    choices:
    - content: "Machine learning models should be monitored by automatic analysis with established performance thresholds that trigger alerts."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Although automatic analysis helps flag performance concerns, it cannot always determine if and why a model isn’t working correctly."
    - content: "Machine learning models should be monitored by manual spot check analysis with someone testing the model and applying their own analysis."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Although manual spot check analysis can sometimes be the only way to determine if and why a model isn’t working, the process is much more time-consuming as it requires manual testing."
    - content: "A combination of automatic monitoring and manual spot checks."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. A combination of automated analysis and manual spot-check analysis is recommended to prevent performance issues from falling through the cracks."
    - content: "Machine learning models should be monitored by continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD)."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) are recommended for retraining ML models, not monitoring them."
  - content: "What is a model registry?"
    choices:
    - content: "A central place to save every version of every model."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. With a registry, teams can easily revert to a previous version if something isn't working, even after the solution has gone into production. The model registry also serves as an audit trail for each model's history and makes it possible to automatically trigger workflows after certain actions or events."
    - content: "A method of testing and validating model performance."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The model registry doesn’t evaluate model performance."
    - content: "A shared environment where individuals can work on models at the same time."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Shared environments are helpful but separate from the model registry."
    - content: "A requirement for deploying ML models on the cloud."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A model registry is valuable, but not a prerequisite for deployment. Models in the registry can be deployed on the edge or on-prem as well as the cloud."
