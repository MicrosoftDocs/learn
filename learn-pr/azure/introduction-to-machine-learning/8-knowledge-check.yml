  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: 'What makes machine-learning algorithms different from traditional algorithms?'
    choices:
    - content: "Machine-learning algorithms are always more complicated to build than traditional algorithms."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect."
    - content: "Machine-learning algorithms must be trained every time they're used."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Machine-learning algorithms only have to be trained once. Once trained, they can be used as many times as is needed."
    - content: "Machine-learning algorithms are shaped by data directly as part of development. Traditional algorithms are based almost entirely on theory or on opinions of the person writing the code."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct."
  - content: 'When do we want to perform training?'
    choices:
    - content: "Whenever we want to use a model"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect."
    - content: "Only when we want to improve the model"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct."
    - content: "Every time we load a model from file"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect."
  - content: 'What is the relationship between a model, an objective, and training data?'
    choices:
    - content: "The training data is used to make changes to the model. These changes help the model get better at achieving the objective."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct."
    - content: "The training data is used to make changes to the objective. These changes help the objective be more like the model."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The training data and objective normally aren't changed during training."
    - content: "The model is used to make changes to the training data. These changes help the training data get better at achieving the objective."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The training data and objective normally aren't changed during training."
