We covered a lot of new jargon in this module. Let’s recap what we've learned:

* The goal of machine learning is to find patterns in data and use this to make estimates
* Machine learning differs from normal software development in that we use special code, rather than our own intuition, to improve how well the software works.

* The learning process conceptually uses four components:
* **Data** about the topic we are interested in.
* A **model**, which makes estimates.
* An **objective** the model is trying to achieve.
* An **optimizer**, which is the additional code that changes the model depending on its performance.

* Data can be thought of as features, and labels. Features correspond to potential model inputs, while labels correspond to model outputs, or desired model outputs
* Pandas and Plotly are powerful tools to explore datasets in Python
* Once we have a trained model, we can save to disk for later use.
