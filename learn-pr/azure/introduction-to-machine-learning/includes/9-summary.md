We covered some significant new jargon in this module. Let’s recap what we've learned:

* The goal of machine learning is to find patterns in data and use these patterns to make estimates.
* Machine learning differs from normal software development in that we use special code, rather than our own intuition, to improve how well the software works.

* The learning process conceptually uses four components:
  * **Data**, information we want to learn from.
  * A **model**, which makes estimates about the data.
  * An **objective** the model is trying to achieve.
  * An **optimizer**, extra code that changes the model depending on its performance.

* Data can be thought of as features, and labels. Features correspond to potential model inputs, while labels correspond to model outputs, or desired model outputs.
* Pandas and Plotly are powerful tools to explore datasets in Python.
* Once we have a trained model, we can save it to disk for later use.
