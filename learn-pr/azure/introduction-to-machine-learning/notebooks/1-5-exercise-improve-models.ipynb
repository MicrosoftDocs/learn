    "# Exercise: Datasets in Python\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Here, we load data from a file, filter it, and graph it. Doing so is a very important first step in order to build proper models, or to understand their limitations.\n",
    "\n",
    "As before, there's no need to edit any code in the examples in this unit. Try to read it, understand it, then press the **Run** button to run it. As always, it's vitally important that these code blocks are run in the correct order, and nothing is missed.\n",

    "## Load data with Pandas\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a large variety of libraries that help you work with data. In Python, one of the most common is *Pandas*. We used pandas briefly in the previous exercise. Pandas can open data saved as text files and store it in an organized table called a `DataFrame`.\n",
