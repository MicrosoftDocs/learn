  questions:
  - content: What is Azure Automation State Configuration?
    choices:
    - content: "A declarative management platform to configure, deploy, and control systems."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "PowerShell DSC is a declarative management platform to configure, deploy, and control systems."
    - content: "A service used to write, manage, and compile PowerShell Desired State Configuration (DSC) configurations, import DSC resources, and assign configurations to target nodes."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Azure Automation State Configuration enables you to ensure that all virtual machines in a collection are in the same consistent state."
    - content: "A service that manages the state configuration on each destination, or node."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The local configuration manager (LCM) is responsible for updating the configuration to match the desired state on a node."
  - content: "A PowerShell DSC script ______________."
    choices:
    - content: "Contains the steps required to configure a virtual machine to get it into a specified state."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "A PowerShell DSC script is declarative. It describes the desired state but doesn't list the steps necessary to achieve that state."
    - content: "Is idempotent."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "A PowerShell DSC script is declarative. It describes the desired state but doesn't list the steps necessary to achieve that state."
    - content: "Describes the desired state."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "A PowerShell DSC script is declarative. It describes the desired state but doesn't include the steps necessary to achieve that state."
  - content: "Why should you use pull mode instead of push mode for DSC?"
    choices:
    - content: "Pull mode is best for complex environments that need redundancy and scale."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "The local configuration manager (LCM) on each node automatically polls the pull server at regular intervals to get the latest configuration details. In push mode, an administrator manually sends the configurations toward the nodes."
    - content: "Pull mode is easy to set up and doesn't need its own dedicated infrastructure."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Push mode is easy to set up and doesn't need its own dedicated infrastructure"
    - content: "Pull mode uses the local configuration manager (LCM) to make sure that the state on each node matches the state specified by the configuration."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Both pull mode and push mode use the LCM. The LCM is responsible for updating the configuration to match the desired state on a node."
