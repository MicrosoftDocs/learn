  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: 'Why is linear regression a popular model?'
    choices:
    - content: "It's fast to calculate and easily interpreted"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect."
    - content: "It's easy to extrapolate from and the fitting procedure doesn't require ‘tuning’ to find an optimum solution"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect."
    - content: "Both options are correct"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct."
  - content: 'What is the difference between multiple and simple regression?'
    choices:
    - content: "Simple regression uses special mathematics to speed up analysis"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect."
    - content: "Multiple regression predicts multiple labels, but simple regression doesn't"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect."
    - content: "Multiple regression accepts multiple features, but simple regression doesn't"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct."
  - content: 'What are the main strengths and weaknesses of polynomial regression, compared to simple linear regression?'
    choices:
    - content: "Polynomial regression is a more popular method than linear regression, but it always needs to be fitted iteratively"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect."
    - content: "Polynomial regression can explain nonlinear relationships, but it often makes extreme predictions when extrapolated"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct."
    - content: "Polynomial regression can be extrapolated, unlike simple linear regression, but it can take a long time to compute"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect."
