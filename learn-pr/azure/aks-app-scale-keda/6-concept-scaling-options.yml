  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "Your workload performs CPU-intensive photo transformation. Which scaling option should you choose?"
    choices:
    - content: "KEDA"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Although you can use KEDA to scale CPU-intensive workloads, an HPA is the best choice."
    - content: "HPA"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "In this case, using an HPA is the best choice for CPU-intensive workloads."
    - content: "Cluster Autoscaler"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The Cluster Autoscaler is for scaling the number of nodes in a Kubernetes cluster."
  - content: "Your cluster is getting close to using all its available resources during peak times. Which scaling option should you use?"
    choices:
    - content: "KEDA"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "KEDA doesn't increase the total available resources for a cluster."
    - content: "HPA"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The HPA doesn't increase the total available resources for a cluster."
    - content: "Cluster Autoscaler"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "The Cluster Autoscaler is for scaling the number of nodes in a Kubernetes cluster."
  - content: "Your service processes messages from an Apache Kafka queue. Which scaling option should you choose?"
    choices:
    - content: "KEDA"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "KEDA is the ideal choice for scaling resources based on received events."
    - content: "HPA"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Although you can use an HPA to scale this service, it's not efficient and fails to measure the quantity of messages in the queue."
    - content: "Cluster Autoscaler"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The Cluster Autoscaler is for scaling the number of nodes in a Kubernetes cluster."
