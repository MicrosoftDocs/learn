  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "What key roles does KEDA play within Kubernetes?"
    choices:
    - content: "metrics server and configuration manager"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "KEDA acts as a Kubernetes metrics server but not a configuration manager."
    - content: "agent and metrics server"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "KEDA activates and deactivates Kubernetes Deployments and StatefulSets to scale to and from zero on no events. KEDA acts as a Kubernetes metrics server that exposes rich event data."
    - content: "agent and configuration manager"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "KEDA acts as an agent but not a configuration manager."
  - content: "What type of workloads can KEDA scale?"
    choices:
    - content: "StatefulSets, Deployments, and Pods"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "KEDA does scale StatefulSets and Deployments but not Pods."
    - content: "Deployment, Pods and Containers"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "KEDA scales Deployments but not Pods. Containers are not a valid Kubernetes resource."
    - content: "Deployment, StatefulSets and Custom Resource implementing the scale subresource."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Although Deployment and StatefulSets are the most common approach to scaling in KEDA any Resource that implements the scale subresource can be scaled using KEDA."
  - content: "What is the primary reason for using Scaled Jobs?"
    choices:
    - content: "To handle long running processes."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Rather than processing multiple events within a deployment, a single job is created per event and runs it to completion."
    - content: "To scale more efficiently."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Scaled jobs do not affect efficiency of scaling a resource."
    - content: "To consume less resources."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Scaled jobs do not affect the amount of resources consumed."
