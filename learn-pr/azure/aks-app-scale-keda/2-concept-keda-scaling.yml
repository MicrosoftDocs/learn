  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "What key roles does KEDA play within Kubernetes?"
    choices:
    - content: "Metrics server and configuration manager."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "KEDA acts as a Kubernetes metrics server but not a configuration manager."
    - content: "Agent and metrics server."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "KEDA activates and deactivates Kubernetes Deployments and StatefulSets to scale to and from zero on no events. KEDA acts as a Kubernetes metrics server that exposes rich event data."
    - content: "Agent and configuration manager."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "KEDA acts as an agent but not a configuration manager."
  - content: "What type of workloads can KEDA scale?"
    choices:
    - content: "StatefulSets, Deployments, and Pods."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "KEDA scales StatefulSets and Deployments but not Pods."
    - content: "Deployment, Pods, and Containers."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "KEDA scales Deployments but not Pods. Containers aren't a valid Kubernetes resource."
    - content: "Deployment, StatefulSets, and Custom Resource implementing the scale subresource."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Although Deployment and StatefulSets are the most common approach to scaling in KEDA, any Resource that implements the scale subresource can be scaled using KEDA."
  - content: "What's the primary reason for using Scaled Jobs?"
    choices:
    - content: "To handle long-running processes."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Rather than processing multiple events within a deployment, a single job is created per event and runs it to completion."
    - content: "To scale more efficiently."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Scaled jobs don't affect efficiency of scaling a resource."
    - content: "To consume fewer resources."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Scaled jobs don't affect the amount of resources consumed."
