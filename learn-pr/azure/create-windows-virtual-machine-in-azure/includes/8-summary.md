In this module, you learned how to create a Windows VM using the Azure portal. You then connected to the public IP address of the VM and managed it over RDP. You discovered how RDP in Azure provides a similar experience to logging on interactively to a physical computer.

You learned that while RDP allows us to interact with the operating system and software of the virtual machine, the portal allows us to configure the virtual hardware and connectivity. We also could have used PowerShell or the Azure CLI, if a command-line or scriptable environment was preferred.
