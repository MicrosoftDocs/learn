  questions:
  - content: "Can an administrator use the Azure NAT Gateway service to configure inbound connections handling?"
    choices:
    - content: "No. You can’t use Azure NAT Gateway to configure inbound connections handling."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Azure NAT Gateway doesn’t manage inbound connections."
    - content: "Yes. Azure NAT Gateway provides options to configure inbound connections handling."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Azure NAT Gateway doesn’t provide options for inbound connections."
    - content: "Yes. However, you need to install an add-on."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Azure NAT Gateway doesn’t have an add-on for this purpose."
  - content: "In a deployment, an Azure VM with a public IP assigned is placed in the subnet to which the Azure NAT Gateway service is assigned. Will the public IP address be used after Azure NAT Gateway deployment?"
    choices:
    - content: "No. The public IP address won’t be used after Azure NAT Gateway is deployed."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The Azure VM keeps the public IP address for inbound connections."
    - content: "Yes. The public IP address is used, but only for inbound connections."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Azure VMs with public IP addresses continue to use the address for connections initiated from the internet."
    - content: "No. The public IP address will be removed from the Azure VM after Azure NAT Gateway is deployed."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The Azure NAT Gateway service doesn’t remove public IP addresses."
  - content: "A virtual network has four subnets. Azure VMs within these subnets frequently experience port exhaustion. An administrator decides to deploy the Azure NAT Gateway service. How many instances of Azure NAT Gateway should they deploy?"
    choices:
    - content: "The administrator should deploy four instances of Azure NAT Gateway."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. There’s no need to deploy four instances, because Azure NAT Gateway supports multiple subnets within the same virtual network."
    - content: "A multiple subnets scenario isn’t supported with Azure NAT Gateway."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Azure NAT Gateway supports multiple subnets within the same virtual network."
    - content: "Only one instance of Azure NAT Gateway is needed."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Azure NAT Gateway supports multiple subnets."
  - content: "Configuring an Azure NAT Gateway service requires configuring a public IP address as well. Is it mandatory to create both a public IP address object and public IP prefix object?"
    choices:
    - content: "No. It isn’t mandatory to create any IP object."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Azure NAT Gateway requires that you create at least one IP object—address or prefix."
    - content: "Yes. You need to create both objects."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Azure NAT Gateway doesn’t require you to create both the address and prefix for IP addresses."
    - content: "You don’t need to create both objects. Only one object is mandatory."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Azure NAT Gateway requires that you create at least one IP object—address or prefix."
