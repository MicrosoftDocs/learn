Data is everywhere. It’s on your devices, your organization’s file servers, and in various cloud-storage services. Business and personal data often resides in many locations. Therefore, data leakage, misuse, and loss could be more probable than ever before. At the same time, data is often extremely valuable. Unauthorized disclosure (or access), processing, or use of personal or business data can cause considerable losses for individuals and companies.

This is why data protection is important for companies and individuals. People should understand the need for data protection and learn necessary skills to help protect their data. The importance of data protection may also increase as the amount or sensitivity of data that's created and stored grows.

Another important consideration is that data is being accessed from everywhere. Individuals and organizations store ever-increasing amounts of data in the cloud and access it from various locations, using many different devices. These devices and locations also play a key role in Contoso’s data-protection strategy.

*Data protection* consists of processes, procedures, and technologies that can help safeguard valuable information from corruption, compromise, or loss. It's important to recognize that no one single product or technology can guarantee data protection in every scenario. Rather, a combination of available procedures, technologies, and products may be necessary to help protect your data.

To help implement data protection, you may want to consider:

- The sensitivity of the type of data that you want to help protect. Not all data may need the same level of protection or benefit from the same data protection approach. For example, personal data such as email addresses might not require the same protection as sensitive personal data, such as social security numbers and health information.

- Where your data is stored. Appropriate data-protection technologies and methods often depend on how your data is stored. For example, you might not use the same approach to help protect data stored on your mobile device that you would for data stored on your company’s file server or in the cloud.

- Applicable data-protection requirements and regulations. Laws and regulations, may define specific data-protection requirements. You should work with your legal representation to ensure you have a solid knowledge of these requirements and how they apply to Contoso.

- Technologies that enable data protection. Again, there isn't a single technology that ensures complete data protection for every scenario. To help protect your data efficiently, you may want to become familiar with the available platforms, processes, and technologies appropriate for Contoso’s specific needs.

## Data protection vs. data privacy

It’s also important to know the difference between data protection and data privacy. Data protection usually pertains to helping protect data from unlawful or unauthorized access, use, destruction, damage or loss. Data privacy generally focuses on the collection, use and permissible handling of personal data and what rights an individual has to control the data that has been collected about them.

Data privacy typically addresses questions such as:

- Who can collect data.

- Who can access data.

- What an organization can do with the data they have collected.

- How long data may be retained by an organization.

- The level of control an individual has on their data.

> [!NOTE]
> Data protection generally pertains to technical control over data. Data privacy typically refers to legal or regulatory requirements. Data protection doesn't ensure data privacy or vice versa.

## Key principles for data protection

There isn't a single approach or technology that guarantees data protection. However, there are common key principles that may be important in the design of a data-protection strategy, including:

- Some level of data protection should be implemented when data creation, or collection, occurs, and should persist with the data through its entire lifecycle. For example, you might want data to remain protected regardless of whether an employee shares it within, or outside, your organization.

- An organization's employees should have a good understanding of how data sharing might occur. This includes being aware of what data they're sharing, who they are sharing it with, and how they are sharing it. Helping control data access and sharing is a key part of data protection.

- You can't achieve good data protection only by implementing technological measures on specific data that you want to help protect. You also must help protect user identities, the devices on which users are accessing data, and your network traffic.
