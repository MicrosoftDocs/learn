quiz:
  questions:
  - content: "The Kubernetes community found some bugs in the current release. After Kubernetes makes these bug fixes, what should they do?"
    choices:
    - content: "Deprecate Kubernetes 1.0.0 and release Kubernetes 2.0.0."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Depreciating Kubernetes 1.0.0 and then releasing Kubernetes 2.0.0 is a major version release. Bug fixes don't require such drastic changes."
    - content: "Make a patch release."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "A patch release means a new patch version is available that includes fixes to the identified bugs."
    - content: "Make a feature release."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "A feature, or *minor*, release is made when rolling out new features and doesn't include bug fixes."
  - content: "Kubernetes just announced they have released a new version, v1.20.0. The last known version of Kubernetes was v1.19.10. Using your knowledge of semantic versioning, what type of changes does v1.20.0 indicate?"
    choices:
    - content: "Major updates."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "According to the semantic versioning rules, which follow the `X.Y.Z` format, major version updates change the `X` value."
    - content: "Minor updates"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "According to the semantic versioning rules, which follow the `X.Y.Z` format, minor version updates change the `Y` value."
    - content: "Patch updates"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "According to the semantic versioning rules, which follow the `X.Y.Z` format, patch version updates change the `Z` value."
  - content: "When Kubernetes releases a new version, what was updated?"
    choices:
    - content: "The node image for the control plane."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Kubernetes doesn't upgrade or patch your node images. You're responsible for making those updates as part of a separate process."
    - content: "Security patches for the operating system."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Kubernetes doesn't upgrade the operating system of the compute nodes it runs on. You're responsible for making those updates as part of a separate process."
    - content: "The core components of the Kubernetes runtime."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "The core components of the Kubernetes runtime (kubelet, kube-controller, kube-proxy, kube-scheduler, and kube-apiserver) are updated as part of new version releases."
