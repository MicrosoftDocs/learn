Azure SQL Database is a service that enables you to create a relational database in the cloud. It provides a high degree of compatibility with Microsoft SQL Server. You can define tables, insert, update, delete, and query data. It is also a highly scalable service, capable of supporting many thousands of concurrent requests.

Imagine that you work as a developer for a university. The university is creating a web application that academic advisors can use to discuss courses and plans of study with students. The development team would like to use Azure SQL Database to store their data, which is currently held as comma-delimited data in text files. They're planning to create a .NET Core app for the advisors to use initially. They need to know how to create and manipulate a database, and how to connect an ASP.NET application to the database to query data.

You'll create a single database using the Azure SQL Database service. You'll see how to import data into the database, and query this data. Finally, you'll configure a web application to connect to and query a database.

Azure SQL Database currently supports three deployment options: single, elastic pool, and managed instance. You'll focus on the single database deployment option.
