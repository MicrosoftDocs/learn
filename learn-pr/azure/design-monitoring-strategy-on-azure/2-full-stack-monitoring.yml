  questions:
  - content: At what point should DevOps teams implement application monitoring for optimal application health and performance?
    choices:
    - content: During development only 
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Monitoring only during development limits problematic code from being deployed, but doesn't provide visibility when the app is live in production.
    - content: In production only
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Monitoring only during production provides visibility into live issues, but doesn't reveal problems and errors during development, QA, and test phases.
    - content: During development and while in production
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Monitoring applications in development prevent errors and exceptions later in production. By monitoring applications in production, you identify problems and risks that affect users.
  - content: What's the term for a monitoring strategy that takes a complete approach to monitoring, triaging, and diagnosing application, infrastructure, and security issues?
    choices:
    - content: Full-stack monitoring
