Your organization asked you to design a monitoring strategy to cover all of its technology solutions. The strategy needed to be able to quickly identify and minimize problems and failures, and to provide insights and alerts for collected log and metrics data.

This learning module showed you how to use Azure Monitor features like Application Insights and Virtual machine (VM) insights to monitor the health and performance of your applications and infrastructure. You also saw how to use Microsoft Defender for Cloud and Microsoft Sentinel to monitor the security of your infrastructure and enterprise.

- Azure Monitor lets you analyze and address environment health and performance issues, and query to analyze data in a single location.
- Defender for Cloud helps you identify and address risks to your security posture.
- Microsoft Sentinel gives you security incident management, investigation, and response capabilities.

These Azure services give you a full-stack approach to monitoring applications and infrastructure. Because you can address issues faster and more effectively, your organization is more secure, productive, cost-effective, and competitive.
