  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: 'What is the difference between supervised learning and unsupervised learning?'
    choices:
    - content: "Supervised learning requires human supervision, whereas unsupervised learning doesn't."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect."
    - content: "Supervised learning always uses an optimizer, but unsupervised learning never does."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect."
    - content: "Supervised learning trains a model by comparing estimations to correct answers. The cost function for unsupervised learning doesn't need correct answers."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct."
  - content: 'What is the role of the cost function in supervised learning?'
    choices:
    - content: "To maximize the cost so that the objective is reached."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect."
    - content: "To calculate the cost by comparing estimations to correct answers."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct."
    - content: "To update model parameters."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect."
  - content: 'How does gradient descent know how to update parameters?'
    choices:
    - content: "It compares costs for several combinations of parameters, and then it selects the best option."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect."
    - content: "It uses an internal understanding of the relationship between features and labels to make intelligent choices."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect."
    - content: "It uses calculus to estimate the slope of the cost function."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. After the slope is known, it's clear whether to make parameters smaller or larger."
  - content: 'Why are many cost functions available?'
    choices:
    - content: "A unique cost function is required for each processed currency or banking system."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect."
    - content: "Cost functions help models process data, and many model types are available."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Models don't rely on other components to make an estimation. That said, cost functions can need slight adjustments so that they're compatible with different types of model output."
    - content: "Different cost functions can arrive at different answers, and what's best depends on the goal."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct."
  - content: 'Why is learning rate important?'
    choices:
    - content: "It speeds up or slows down training."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect."
    - content: "If the learning rate is too large or too small, it can prevent a model from being trained optimally."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect."
    - content: "Both options are correct."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct."
