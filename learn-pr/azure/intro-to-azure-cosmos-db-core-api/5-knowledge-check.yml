      Which API is considered the "native API" for Azure Cosmos DB?
    choices:
      - content: MongoDB API
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: >
          While the MongoDB API implements the wire protocol for MongoDB, it is not the native API for Azure Cosmos DB.
      - content: SQL API
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: >
          The SQL API is the native API for Azure Cosmos DB. All other APIs map to the SQL API in their implementations.
      - content: Cassandra API
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: >
          While the Cassandra API implements the much of the native Apache Cassandra wire protocol, it is not the native API for Azure Cosmos DB.

      Which property is required to be specified when creating a new Azure Cosmos DB SQL API container?
    choices:
      - content: Partition key path
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: >
          All containers in an Azure Cosmos DB SQL API database must have a partition key path defined.
      - content: Time-to-live
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: >
          You can create a container without a time-to-live value. The container will not expire items automatically.
      - content: Indexing policy
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: >
          You can create a container without specifying an indexing policy. Azure Cosmos DB will automatically index every property of every item.

      Your team has an existing Azure Cosmos DB account, database, and container.
      A new team member would like to configure Azure Cosmos DB for a different team with unique needs for regional replication and default consistency levels.
      Which new resource should that member of the team create?
    choices:
      - content: Container
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: >
          If your team member creates a new container, the default consistency level and global replication settings will remain the same between both teams.
      - content: Database
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: >
          If your team member creates a new database, the default consistency level and global replication settings will remain the same between both teams.
      - content: Account
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: >
          In order to have different behavior for replication and default consistency, your team member must create a new account.
