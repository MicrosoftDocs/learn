#### Engineering and construction

With Mixed Reality, architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) firms are empowered to overcome design, modeling, collaboration, and building-site challenges to improve productivity and enhance project quality and decision-making. For example, AEC firms have reduced rework by 75%, saving $44 per hour<sup>1</sup>.

Common scenarios in which AEC organizations benefit from mixed reality on Microsoft HoloLens 2:

* **Clash detection**: Enable onsite workers to preemptively identify issues, detect clashes, and gain buy-in of onsite workers and key stakeholders with overlay designs on physical locations. This mitigates late-stage design changes that could result in rework, budget overrun, and project delays.
* **3D plan and model demonstrations**: Empower project leaders, designers, and engineers and improve customer service and sales with 3D demonstrations and immersive visualizations.
Self-guided learning: Equip onsite workers to view task instructions, essential data, and model visualizations while in the flow of work, thereby increasing speed, quality, and safety.

*"HoloLens 2 provides an exponential increase in knowledge transfer compared to text or picture documentation. With the 3D interface, you can see a vehicle in the correct location and spatial orientation, and you can pull away or hide the parts you don’t need to see and tear down a virtual model of a car in a fraction of the time it would take with a real one."* — Porsche.

#### Healthcare organizations

Healthcare providers are faced with a unique challenge: the work itself is hands-on, but any training that takes place in an authentic environment runs the risk of adversely impacting patient care. Using HoloLens to train healthcare workers allows them to learn how to examine, diagnose, treat patients, and practice technical surgical skills in a low-risk simulated environment that's devoid of real-life consequences.

Mixed reality empowers providers, payors, and health-science experts to reimagine healthcare by accelerating diagnoses, reducing time to care, and enabling personalization. Using Microsoft mixed reality, healthcare providers reduced average consumables by 80%, saving $4,000 per trainee<sup>1</sup>.
