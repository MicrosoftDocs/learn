In this module, you learned about the storage concepts behind Windows containers. How containers have temporary storage for their own file system, network, and processes, but also provide mechanisms for persistent storage.

You learned how Windows containers can create and manage persistent storage in a local environment and in a production-scale environment with a container orchestrator like Kubernetes or a managed orchestrator like Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). Finally, you saw how local storage and cloud storage can be used together with AKS Hybrid solutions.  

You can now apply these concepts and skills to your own scenarios and projects involving Windows containers.
