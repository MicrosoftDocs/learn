The Migrate methodology in the Cloud Adoption Framework guides you through migration to Azure using repeatable processes and common tools.

Migration of any datacenter can involve migrating various technology platforms and workloads. Re-creating the architecture and configuration of workloads in the cloud is time-consuming and produces diminishing returns.

The Migrate methodology in the Cloud Adoption Framework, the Azure migration center, and Azure Migrate tooling reduce that effort. They use repeatable processes and tools that facilitate a successful migration with minimal time and effort for your technology and workload needs.

In this module, you learn the tools, the processes, and the options used in migration. You can then apply that knowledge to migrate all workloads and platforms in your current environment.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you'll:

- Understand the tools commonly used in migration.
- Learn about the migration processes required to migrate effectively.
- Demonstrate a migration (hands-on if possible).
- Understand options for properly migrating various platforms and workloads.
- Choose the best learning path to migrate a specific platform or workload.

## Prerequisites

- Foundational understanding of cloud migration
- Understanding of your organization's migration plan and the types of workloads you need to migrate
