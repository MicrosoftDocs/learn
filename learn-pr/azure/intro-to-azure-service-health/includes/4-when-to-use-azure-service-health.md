Your cloud services will eventually experience failures, and you must be ready for this eventuality. There are different ways to be ready, and you should take advantage of the Azure Service Health capabilities.

As important as monitoring your virtual machines, security events, network connectivity, applications, databases, and so on is, you should also be aware that your cloud platform's health should be a top priority.

In Azure, you have different tools to accomplish your monitoring strategy that complement each other. You should include Azure Service Health in your monitoring toolset to allow you to be aware of any issues on the Azure platform.

As an example, if you can be alerted in advance regarding a service issue on the datacenter where your virtual machines are running, you can be proactive and avoid issues within your workload. For this reason, you should consider using Azure Service Health to stay informed on service issues that affect you and the Azure deployments you have. The service is provided free.

The answer to when to use Azure Service Health is to *always* use it. It doesn't matter if you have other tools to monitor the performance of your virtual machines or the health of your applications. Those tools won't be aware of planned maintenance at Azure datacenters. The Azure Service Health gives you this information.
