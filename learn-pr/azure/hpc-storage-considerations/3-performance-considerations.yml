  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "Small block sizes reduce performance if your files are:"
    choices:
    - content: "Small"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Small block sizes combined with small files don't reduce performance."
    - content: "Large"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Small block sizes combined with large files reduce performance, because large files need to be broken down to fit the smaller block size."
  - content: "If you have a disk that supports 5,000 IOPS and your block size is 4K, your total possible throughput is:"
    choices:
    - content: "9 MBps"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "5,000 IOPS * 4K block size = 20 MBps"
    - content: "15 MBps"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "5,000 IOPS * 4K block size = 20 MBps"
    - content: "20 MBps"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "5,000 IOPS * 4K block size = 20 MBps"
