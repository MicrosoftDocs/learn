Dashboards tell a story through visualizations, and are an excellent way to view your data and see all of your most important insights at a glance. Azure Data Explorer dashboards in the web UI natively support the Kusto Query Language over data hosted in Azure Data Explorer. These dashboards help you progress quickly from raw data to shared insights. 

## Example scenario

Suppose you're a weather enthusiast with a passion for data science, who's exploring an unfamiliar data set of storm data from the US. You're using queries and visualizations to gain insights into this dataset. Now, you want to step away from the raw data and interact with the data insights to gain further insights.

It turns out you also have colleagues who are curious amateur meteorologists, and you want to share an interactive view of these data insights with these colleagues.

## What will we be doing?

In this module, you create a new dashboard from a query to display query visualizations. You add new tiles to an existing dashboard. Then, you create a parameter to use as a picker in a dashboard tile, and use this parameter in a cross-filter. Finally, you learn how to manage permissions and share your dashboard with others.

## What is the main goal?

By the end of this session, you're able to:

* Generate dashboards that display multiple insights at a glance.
* Share dashboard insights with colleagues.
