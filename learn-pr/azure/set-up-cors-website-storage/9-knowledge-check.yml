  questions:
  - content: "What is CORS?"
    choices:
    - content: "An HTTP feature that provides a way for web applications on one domain to access resources in another domain securely."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "CORS is an HTTP feature that provides a way for web applications on one domain to access resources in another domain securely."
    - content: "An HTTP feature that prevents Web applications from accessing resources based on User permissions"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "CORS is an HTTP feature that provides a way for web applications on one domain to access resources in another domain securely."
    - content: "A Security feature that allows browsers to a web site's resources"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "For security reasons, most web browsers restrict resource access to a single domain. CORS is an HTTP feature that provides this."
  - content: "What is a CORS preflight request?"
    choices:
    - content: "The preflight request is sent to verify if authentication headers have been set correctly before an actual request"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Preflight requests use the OPTIONS header. The preflight request is sent before the original request, hence the term 'preflight.' The purpose of the preflight request is to determine whether or not the original request is safe (for example, a DELETE request). The server will respond to the preflight request and indicate whether or not the original request is safe. If the server specifies that the original request is safe, it will allow the original request. Otherwise, it will block the original request."
