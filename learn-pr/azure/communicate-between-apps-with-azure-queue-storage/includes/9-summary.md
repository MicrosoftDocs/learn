In this module, you learned how queues in Azure storage accounts are used to pass messages between components in a distributed application. Using queues in this way can help to make a distributed application more reliable and resilient to failures and periods of high demand. Using the Azure.Storage.Queues package for .NET, you can easily write C# or VB.NET code that creates queues, adds messages, or retrieves and removes messages from queues.
