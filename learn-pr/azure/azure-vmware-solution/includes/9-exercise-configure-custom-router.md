Use the following instructions to configure the infrastructure for FRR and generate the default route:

```azurecli
az network vnet subnet create  -n <NVA-Subnet-name> -g <resource-group-name> --vnet-name <vnet-name>  --address-prefix 10.0.2.0/24

az network nic create -g <resource-group-name> --vnet-name <vnet-name>  --subnet <NVA-Subnet-name> -n <NVA-nic-name>

az vm availability-set create --name <nva-availability-set-name> --resource-group <resource-group-name> --location <your-preferred-azure-region>

az vm create --name <nva-vm-name>  --resource-group <resource-group-name>  --location <your-preferred-azure-region> --image OpenLogic:CentOS:8_5:8.5.2022012100 --size Standard_D1_v2        --availability-set <nva-availability-set-name>  --authentication-type password  --admin-username <vm-admin-user-name>  --admin-password <vm-admin-username-password> --storage-sku Standard_LRS  --nics <NVA-nic-name>
```

## Configure FRR routing on the NVA

Now, you're going to configure the FRR software.

1. Update the routeServerSubnetPrefix and bgpNvaSubnetGateway variables in the following script.

     ```
    #
    # IP prefix of the RouteServerSubnet in the Firewall VNet. 
    #  
    routeServerSubnetPrefix="<azure-route-server-subnet-prefix>"
    
    #
    # The first IP address of the subnet to which the "eth0" device is attached.
    #
    bgpNvaSubnetGateway="<nva-azure-subnet-first-ip-address>"
    
    # Install FRR
    sudo dnf install frr -y
    
    # Configure FRR to run the bgpd daemon
    sudo sed -i 's/bgpd=no/bgpd=yes/g' /etc/frr/daemons
    sudo touch /etc/frr/bgpd.conf
    sudo chown frr /etc/frr/bgpd.conf
    sudo chmod 640 /etc/frr/bgpd.conf
    
    # Start FRR daemons
    sudo systemctl enable frr --now
    
    
    # Add static routes to ensure reachability for Route Servers (Route Server are not-directly-connected external BGP neighbours).
    
    # Please note that this configuration is transient and will be lost if the VM is rebooted.
    
    # On CentOS VMs, you can add these routes to /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/route-eth<X> to make them persistent across reboots. 
    
    sudo ip route add $routeServerSubnetPrefix via $bgpNvaSubnetGateway dev eth0
     ```

1. Copy the edited script from step 1.
1. Sign in to NVA VM shell.
1. Paste the copied script from clipboard as plaintext in the NVA shell (**Ctrl-Shift-V**).
1. Run the script and wait until the script finishes in a minute or so.
1. Ensure no errors are reported after execution.

   :::image type="content" source="../media/9-config-frrouting-log.png" alt-text="Screenshot of script execution on NVA VM. Screenshot shows no error at the end of script execution.":::

1. Run **sudo vtysh**
1. Ensure FRR is running, and its command shell started.

   :::image type="content" source="../media/9-config-frrouting-cmd-shell.png" alt-text="Screenshot of sudo prompt on NVA VM. Screenshot shows command 'sudo vtysh' being executed.":::

## Configure BGP neighbor and default route for the NVA

This step configures the FRR NVA to have Azure Route Server as its BGP neighbor. A default route (0.0.0.0/0) is also added in the NVA.

1. Update the following variables in the script.
   1. \<Firewall Private IP address\>
   1. \<IP address of Route Server instance #0\>
   1. \<IP address of Route Server instance #1\>

    ```
    conf term
    !
    route-map SET-NEXT-HOP-FW permit 10
    set ip next-hop <Firewall Private IP address>
    exit
    !
    router bgp 65111
    no bgp ebgp-requires-policy
    neighbor <IP address of Route Server instance #0> remote-as 65515  
    neighbor <IP address of Route Server instance #0> ebgp-multihop 2
    neighbor <IP address of Route Server instance #1> remote-as 65515 
    neighbor <IP address of Route Server instance #1> ebgp-multihop 2
    network 0.0.0.0/0
    !
    address-family ipv4 unicast
      neighbor <IP address of Route Server instance #0> route-map SET-NEXT-HOP-FW out
      neighbor <IP address of Route Server instance #1> route-map SET-NEXT-HOP-FW out
    exit-address-family
    !
    exit
    !
    exit
    !
    write file
    !
    ```

1. sign in to FRR shell.
1. Paste the script with updated variables.
1. Run `show ip bgp` to confirm that the NVA didn't learned routes except its own default route.
1. Run `show ip bgp sum` to confirm that the NVA didn't established BGP sessions.

## Configure Peering with Azure Route Server

The following steps establish a BGP peer relationship between the FRR NVA and Azure Route Server.

1. Run the following commands on Azure CLI prompt:
   ```azurecli
   
    az network routeserver peering create  --name <nva-vm-name>  --peer-ip <private-ip-of-nva-vm-name>  --peer-asn <asn-value-other-than-65515-65520>  --routeserver <routeserver-name>  --resource-group <resource-group-name>`
   
    az network routeserver update --name <routeserver-name>  --resource-group <resource-group-name>   --allow-b2b-traffic true`
   ```

1. Sign in to FRR shell.
1. Run `show ip bgp` to confirm that the NVA learned routes from Azure Route Server.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/9-config-bgp-showip-routes.png" alt-text="Screenshot of command execution on NVA VM. Screenshot shows Azure Route Server as next hop for AVS network.":::

1. Ensure that Azure Firewall has direct internet connectivity by using Azure portal to inspect the Route Table associated with Azure Firewall's subnet.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/9-config-bgp-route-table.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Azure portal menu. The menu entry titled “ToInternet” route table highlights default route configured with Internet as next hop.":::

At this point, you configured Azure VMware Solution private cloud to implement secure outbound internet connectivity. You deployed Azure Route Server for an effective route exchange between Azure VMware Solution private cloud and the NVA. You then deployed Azure Firewall as the exit point for all internet-bound traffic. This was followed-up by using FRR – a custom router, which injects default route with Azure Firewall as the next hop into Azure VMware Solution private cloud.

In the next unit, you'll learn how to implement fine-grained access controls in Azure Firewall, which allows/denies network traffic from Azure VMware Solution private cloud.
