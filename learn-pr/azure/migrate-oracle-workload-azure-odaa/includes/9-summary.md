In this module, you assumed the role of an administrator responsible for recommending a migration approach for moving an Oracle Exadata database-powered application from an on-premises datacenter to the cloud, using Oracle Database@Azure and Azure VMs. You learned how Oracle Database@Azure can match the performance capabilities of your on-premises databases while reducing your management load. You then explored the process of deploying Azure VMs to support your applications, along with the data migration process to finish your migration. Finally, you learned about some of the management and cost issues to consider as you prepare for long-term success. 

You should now be able to:
- Describe how Oracle Database@Azure works and how it can support your applications.
- Identify when this migration model is appropriate and how to plan for it.
- Describe the migration process for your databases and your applications.
