In this scenario, you're an IT administrator at a large financial services organization. You help manage several workloads that rely on Oracle Exadata database services hosted in your on-premises datacenter. These workloads include a critical instance of Oracle E-Business Suite. Management wants to simplify the organization's IT footprint by migrating these applications to the same Azure platform where your organization hosts other mission-critical workloads. 

Your migration schedule is aggressive. You think the best solution is to migrate the data layer of your applications to Oracle Database@Azure, while rehosting your application layer on Azure virtual machines (VMs). However, you need to explain to your managers the advantages of this approach, including how it will support your migration.
