title: 'Continuously validate and test your mission-critical workloads'
summary: A mission-critical workload needs to stay operational even when failures occur. You want to evaluate the impact of changes, system's ability to handle load, and simulate failures before deploying to production. Learn how you can use Azure Load Testing and Azure Chaos Studio simultaneously as part of DevOps pipelines to achieve those goals.
