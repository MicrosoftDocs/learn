  title: Knowledge check
  questions:
  - content: "How many baselines are required?"
    choices:
    - content: "A single baseline is always enough."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The baseline definition of *good* or *healthy* can differ based on the environment or stage, the load profile, or whether the test included Azure Chaos experiments."
    - content: "The number of required baselines depends on how the scenarios are defined."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Different scenarios might require different baselines. For example, performance requirements and expectations can vary across stages and environments. Azure Chaos experiments can also affect the expected performance."
  - content: "Does a baseline define the performance that the deployment can provide?"
    choices:
    - content: "The baseline defines the deployment performance."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Although the baseline defines expected performance numbers, it has no impact on the performance that's provided during deployment."
    - content: "The baseline has no impact on the deployment performance."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Although the baseline defines expected performance numbers, it has no impact on the performance that's provided during deployment."
  - content: "When do baselines need to be evaluated and updated?"
    choices:
    - content: "Establishing baselines is a one-time activity."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Baselines need to be evaluated regularly and need to be updated to reflect application or infrastructure changes that affect performance."
    - content: "Baselines should be evaluated as part of every release or major change."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. You should evaluate existing baselines with every release or major change and adjust them when needed."
    - content: "Baselines should be updated on a yearly basis."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Evaluating baselines only after a specific interval isn't a good practice. Baselines should be evaluated regularly--for example, as part of every release or major change."
