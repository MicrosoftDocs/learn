In this module, you've added continuous validation to prevent performance bottlenecks and completed these tasks: 

- Identify relevant user flows and system flows.
- Define load tests for the flows to validate the expected performance and thresholds.
- Define baselines for normal scenarios and special scenarios that were simulated in chaos experiments.
- Integrate the continuous validation process into an automated workflow.

Congratulations on completing this training module. You've learned how to design continuous validation to meet the requirements of mission-critical operations. Apply the insights to increase your organization's confidence in deploying new releases reduce issues from release rollouts.
