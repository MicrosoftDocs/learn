  title: Knowledge check
  questions:
  - content: "Are all user and system flows equally important?"
    choices:
    - content: "Yes. All user and system flows are equally important."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Some flows might be less important. For example, asynchronous flows might have lower requirements for performance or availability."
    - content: "No. Some flows might have lower requirements."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. For example, batch processing or asynchronous flows might have lower requirements for performance and availability."
  - content: "Does an outage of a component always result in a service degradation?"
    choices:
    - content: "Yes. Every component outage results in a service degradation."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Some components might not cause a service degradation when they fail. Examples are flows that aren't user facing, background processes, and batch processing."
    - content: "No. Not all components have the same requirements for availability and performance."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. For example, an outage of a component that isn't user facing might not result in a service degradation."
  - content: "Can a load test help you evaluate the expected performance of a user flow?"
    choices:
    - content: "Yes. A load test can help identify the performance of a user flow."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. A load test can help identify the performance, performance limits, resource utilization, and optimal scaling behavior of components that build a user flow."
    - content: "No. A load test can't help identify the performance of a user flow."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A load test can help you evaluate the expected performance of a user flow."
