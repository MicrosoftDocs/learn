### Microsoft Azure

Azure is Microsoft's cloud computing platform. Azure provides over 100 services that enable you to do everything from running your existing applications on virtual machines to exploring new software paradigms such as intelligent bots and mixed reality.

- **Compute** services such as VMs and containers that can run your applications

- And many more!
