In the past, companies needed to acquire physical premises and infrastructure to start their business. There was a large up-front cost in hardware and infrastructure to start or grow a business. Cloud computing has changed that requirement. 

Today, the cloud can be used to get up and running quickly. You can start providing services to customers without significant upfront costs or equipment setup time.

These two approaches to investment are referred to as:

- **Capital Expenditure (CapEx)**: CapEx is the spending of money on physical infrastructure up front, and then deducting that expense from your tax bill over time. CapEx is an upfront cost, which has a value that reduces over time.

- **Operational Expenditure (OpEx)**: OpEx is spending money on services or products now and being billed for them now. You can deduct this expense from your tax bill in the same year. There is no upfront cost, you pay for a service or product as you use it.

Demand and growth can be unpredictable and can outpace expectation, which is a challenge for the CapEx model as shown in the following graph.

Companies wanting to try out a new product or service don't need to invest in a large equipment expense. Instead, they can get into a market immediately and pay as much or as little for the infrastructure as the business requires. They also can lower that cost when they need to. A business can still use the CapEx expenditure strategy if they wish, but it is no longer a requirement that they do so. 

OpEx is particularly appealing if the demand fluctuates or is unknown because cloud computing is _agile_. Cloud agility is the ability to rapidly change an IT infrastructure in order to adapt to the evolving needs of the business. For example, if your service peaks one month, you can scale to demand and pay a larger bill for the month. If the following month the demand drops, you can reduce the used resources and be charged less. This agility lets you manage your costs dynamically, and scale up or down as the market changes for your business.
