Every business must decide how they want to store their data and execute their logic. Depending on your business requirements, cloud computing may or may not be right for you.

Let's learn some of the top benefits of cloud computing.

        **It’s cost effective**

Cloud computing provides a **pay-as-you-go** pricing model. Rather than paying for a pre-defined amount of computing resources or hardware up-front, you rent hardware and pay for the resources that you use.

For example, imagine you have a blog, and when you create a new post you want to notify your subscribers via text message. Using the correct cloud computing service, you'll only spend money when you're sending texts to your subscribers. When you're not posting, it won’t cost you anything.

        **It's scalable**

Cloud computing supports both _vertical_ and _horizontal_ scaling depending on your needs.

**Vertical scaling** is the process of adding resources to increase the power of an existing server. Some examples of vertical scaling are: adding a faster CPU, additional CPUs, or adding more memory.

**Horizontal scaling** is the process of adding more servers that function together as one unit. For example, instead of having one server processing incoming requests, you have two.

        **It's elastic**

As your workload changes due to a spike or drop in demand, a cloud computing system can compensate by automatically adding or removing resources.

For example, imagine your website is featured in a news article, which leads to a spike in traffic overnight. Since the cloud is elastic, it automatically allocates more computing resources to handle the increased traffic. When the traffic begins to settle, the cloud notices it has too many resources allocated and begins to remove them so you don’t waste any money.

Another example is if you are running an application used by employees, you can have the cloud automatically add resources for the core hours during which most people access the application, and remove the resources at the usual end of the day.

        **It's current**

When you use the cloud, you’re able to focus on what matters: building and deploying applications. You don't have to be caught up in the maintenance work of software patching, hardware setup, upgrades, and other IT management tasks. All of this is automatically done for you to ensure you're using the latest and greatest tools to run your business.

Additionally, the computer hardware is maintained and upgraded by the cloud provider. For example, if a disk goes out, the disk will be replaced. If new hardware comes out, you don’t have to go through the process of replacing your hardware. You also don’t have to bear the cost for having up-to-date hardware all the time.

        **It's reliable**

When you're running a business, you want to be confident your data is always going to be there. Cloud computing providers offer data backup, disaster recovery, and data replication services to make sure your data is always safe.

        **It's secure**

Think about how you secure your data center. You have physical security &ndash; who can access the building, who can touch server racks, and so on. You also have digital security &ndash; who can connect to your systems and data over the network.

The cloud is essentially a network of large data centers distributed throughout the globe. So cloud providers need to deal with many of these same issues, just at a larger scale.

When it comes to physical security &ndash; threats to cloud infrastructure, cloud providers invest heavily in walls, cameras, gates, security personnel, and so on to protect physical assets. They also have strict procedures in place to ensure employees have access only to those resources that they’ve been authorized to manage.

Then there’s digital security. One thing that makes the cloud unique is that you rent compute and storage resources from a shared pool. Plus, data can travel in many different ways &ndash; within a data center, between data centers, and over the internet.

For example, you want only authorized users to be able to log into virtual machines or storage systems running in the cloud. The responsibility for securing these resources is shared between you and the cloud provider. Cloud providers offer tools that help you mitigate security threats but you must use these tools to protect the resources you use.

## Summary

Cloud computing makes running a business easier. It’s cost effective, scalable, elastic, current, reliable, and secure. This means you’re able to spend more time on what matters and less time on managing the underlying details.
