  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
    - content: "When you make changes to your app, how do you publish an update to Azure Static Web Apps?"
      choices:
        - content: "Delete the Azure Static Web Apps instance and recreate it."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. The Azure Static Web Apps instance doesn't need to be recreated to redeploy changes to your web app."
        - content: "Push commits to the watched branched or create a pull request to the watched branch."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct. Every time you push commits or create pull requests into the watched branch, the GitHub Action automatically builds and deploys your app and its API to Azure."
        - content: "Create a new GitHub Actions workflow to build and publish your web app."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. The existing GitHub Actions workflow is capable of redeploying your web app."
        - content: "Create and push a new branch to your git repository."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. The existing GitHub Actions workflow doesn't watch a new branch."
    - content: "How do you view the progress of building and redeploying after you make changes to your app?"
      choices:
        - content: "Go to the production URL of your app."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. The production URL of your Azure Static Web Apps instance displays your web app, not your build progress."
        - content: "Go to your resource in the Azure portal and view the configuration."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. The configuration for your resource in the Azure portal allows you to view or modify the configuration of the resource. It doesn't show the progress of your build and redeployment of your web app."
        - content: "Push your commits to your watched branched of your git repository."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. Pushing your commits doesn't show your progress, but it triggers a GitHub Actions workflow."
        - content: "Go to the repository on `github.com`, then navigate to the Actions menu."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct. You can view the progress of the GitHub Actions workflow in your browser on your repository."
    - content: "How do you configure your app so that when you navigate to */about* in the browser, it serves the root *index.html* file?"
      choices:
        - content: "Add a `navigationFallback` to the *staticwebapp.config.json* file that uses index.html."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct. You can customize navigation fallbacks in the *staticwebapp.config.json* file in your app's artifact folder. When you define a fallback rule, all unmatched routes serve **/index.html**."
        - content: "Add an entry in *Client.csproj* for a wildcard route **/*** to serve **/index.html**."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. The navigation fallback must be defined in the *staticwebapp.config.json* file."
        - content: "Add an entry in *routes.json* for a wildcard route /index** to serve **/index.html**."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. The *routes.json* file is deprecated in favor of *staticwebapp.config.json*."
        - content: "Configure a wildcard route in the GitHub Actions workflow file to serve **/index.html**."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. The navigation fallback must be defined in the *staticwebapp.config.json* file."
    - content: "How do you tell Azure Static Web Apps that you changed where your API is located?"
      choices:
        - content: "In the Client.csproj file."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. The configuration for your app's locations are defined in the GitHub Actions workflow file."
        - content: "Add an entry in *staticwebapp.config.json* for the location."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. The *staticwebapp.config.json* file is where you define routing rules, not the location of your API."
        - content: "Azure Static Web Apps automatically knows where your code and API are located, without any configuration."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. You can configure the location of your code, artifacts, and API in the GitHub Actions workflow file. If you don't specify these locations, default values are used."
        - content: "In the GitHub Actions workflow file in your *.github/workflows* folder."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct. You can configure the locations for your app code, app artifact, and API in the GitHub Actions workflow file. This file is located in your *.github/workflows* folder."
