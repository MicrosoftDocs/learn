Suppose that you lead the IT development team for Contoso Video, a video production company whose technology stack has migrated to Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). To reduce your team's time and effort building container images and deploying applications, you want to investigate using pipelines to deploy AKS workloads.

In this module, you learn how to create a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline that uses GitHub Actions to deploy Kubernetes workloads to an AKS cluster. You create a proof of concept by using the Contoso Video website.

## Learning objectives

After you complete this module, you can:
- Describe a CI/CD process that uses GitHub Actions.
- Create a deployment pipeline by using GitHub Actions and Azure.
- Deploy a cloud-native application to AKS by using GitHub Actions.

## Prerequisites

- A GitHub account. If you don't already have a GitHub account, create a [free account](https://github.com?azure-portal=true) before you begin.
- Owner or User Role Assignment access to an Azure subscription. If you use a paid subscription, you might incur charges. If you don't already have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?azure-portal=true) before you begin.
- Familiarity with [Kubernetes concepts](https://azure.microsoft.com/topic/what-is-kubernetes/?azure-portal=true&WT.mc_id=akspipeline_intro-learn-ludossan) and [AKS](/azure/aks).
- Familiarity with [Git](/contribute/git-github-fundamentals?WT.mc_id=akspipeline_intro-learn-ludossan), [GitHub](https://github.com/skills/introduction-to-github), and [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/skills/hello-github-actions).
- Experience with running [Azure CLI](/azure/aks/kubernetes-walkthrough?WT.mc_id=akspipeline_intro-learn-ludossan) commands in [Azure Cloud Shell](/azure/cloud-shell/overview).
