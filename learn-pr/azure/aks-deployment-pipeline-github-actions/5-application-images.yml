  questions:
    - content: "What's a Docker image?"
      choices:
        - content: "A zipped directory with code you can download and run on any platform or computer by using Docker."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Docker images are composed of more than just application code."
        - content: "A standalone, lightweight package that includes all you need to build and run an application in a container."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "An application image is the template that Docker uses to create containers that hold your application."
        - content: "A snapshot of your current working directory hosted in the cloud."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Although an image contains everything needed to build and run an application, it isn't a snapshot of the state of your computer."

    - content: "How can a CI/CD pipeline use image tags?"
      choices:
        - content: "To identify different components of the application image."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "The CI/CD pipeline uses tags placed on the overall image, not its components."
        - content: "To give Container Registry access to the image."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Container Registry can use tags to store and retrieve particular images, but it doesn't use the tags for access."
        - content: "To create and deploy different versions of application images that have the same name."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "You can use tags to differentiate between multiple images that have the same name."
