  questions:
    - content: "What's the difference between CI and CD?"
      choices:
        - content: "CI is related to integration and testing, and CD is related to packaging and deployment."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "CI is related to the integration of a team's code, and CD is related to the packaging and deployment of the code."
        - content: "There's no difference between them; CI and CD are two names for the same practice."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "It's possible to have continuous integration without continuous delivery or CD without CI, so they can't be considered the same."
        - content: "CI is related to the people who build the code, and CD is related to tooling."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Both concepts focus on tooling and are related only indirectly to people."
    - content: "What's a CI pipeline?"
      choices:
        - content: "A file that contains instructions for running automated tasks."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "The CI pipeline is composed of files with instructions, but isn't itself a single file."
        - content: "A specific set of tasks you can run when you check in code changes."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "A CI pipeline is a specific set of tasks, but it runs automatically when a new code change is detected."
        - content: "A set of processes that runs automatically when a new code change is detected."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "The set of processes that are automatically triggered by a code change is called a CI pipeline."
