      choices:
        - content: "We can use Helm charts to provide easier access to our hosted Docker images"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Helm is not used to provide faster or easier access to Docker images"
        - content: "Helm allows us to better version our Kubernetes' manifest YAML files"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "This can be done without Helm, too."
        - content: "Because Helm provides several features such as templating which are not present in Kubernetes templates"
