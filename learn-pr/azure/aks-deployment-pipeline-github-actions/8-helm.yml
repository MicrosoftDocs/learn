          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct. Helm is one of the most useful tools in the Kubernetes toolchain."
        - content: "A CI tool that helps you build and deploy Docker containers."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Despite being used in CI/CD pipelines, Helm isn't related to Docker images."
        - content: "A Kubernetes cluster implementation that makes it easier to use the CLI."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Helm isn't a different implementation of Kubernetes."

    - content: "Why is Helm useful in a CI pipeline?"
      choices:
        - content: "We can use Helm charts to provide easier access to our hosted Docker images."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Helm isn't used to provide faster or easier access to Docker images."
        - content: "Helm allows us to better version our Kubernetes' manifest YAML files."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "You can version your Kubernetes' manifest YAML files without Helm, too."
        - content: "Helm provides several features that aren't included in Kubernetes templates, including templating."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct. Beyond offering additional features like templating, Helm allows one-click deployment and provides a CLI to resolve chart dependencies, so the number of steps needed to deploy a Kubernetes application are reduced."
