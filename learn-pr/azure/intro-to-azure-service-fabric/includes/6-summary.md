Our goal was to help you evaluate whether Azure Service Fabric would be a good choice as a distributed systems platform for your business. You looked at several features of the Service Fabric offering. You saw how these features can help you decide if Service Fabric is a good fit for new projects or your existing cloud solution.

You also saw how Service Fabric:

- Supports any cloud and any operating system.
- Offers two cluster models: standard, where you control the underlying resources, and managed, where the underlying resources are managed by Azure.
- Provides a runtime that supports stateless and stateful microservice architectures.
- Integrates with Azure services to streamline your solution.

You can come to Azure and start working in Service Fabric or you can bring Service Fabric and all of its features on premises or on another cloud platform.
