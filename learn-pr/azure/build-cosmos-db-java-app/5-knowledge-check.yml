  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
 
  - content: "Which of the following approaches is the most convenient way to get the URI and master key for your account into your project?"
    choices:
    - content: "The client will infer the connection string when it connects to the server."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Specify the access credentials for your Azure Cosmos DB account."
    - content: "I can get it from the Azure portal."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "It's trivial to find the URI and key on the **Keys** pane of the Azure portal."
    - content: "I can use the Azure CLI."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Although this approach is a good choice, especially because Visual Studio Code has a built-in terminal, it does demand knowledge of the required commands. There is a more convenient alternative."
 
  - content: "When you're working with the Azure Cosmos DB SQL API, which of these packages can you use to perform CRUD operations from a Java application?"
    choices:
    - content: "Azure Cosmos DB Java SDK"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "The Azure Cosmos DB Java SDK is designed for the SQL API."
    - content: "Apache Cassandra client libraries"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Apache Cassandra libraries can work with the Azure Cosmos DB Cassandra API but not with the SQL API."
    - content: "Azure Table storage libraries"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Azure Table storage libraries can work with the Azure Cosmos DB Table API but not with the SQL API."
 
  - content: "When you're working with the Azure Cosmos DB Java SDK `User` class, you use a NoSQL model. What's the best way to change the `firstName` field of a person document from `Ann` to `Fran`?"
    choices:
    - content: "Call `upsertItem` with `FirstName=Fran`."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Although the SDK does have an `upsertItem` method, there's currently no patch API to update specific fields."
    - content: "Call `upsertItem` with an updated `Person` object."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Although this way would work, it isn't the minimum necessary access to meet our requirements. Upsert operations will replace a document if its key already exists or add a new document if not. We don't want to add a new one, so using this method risks introducing subtle, hard-to-track bugs."
    - content: "Call `replaceItem` with an updated `Person` object."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "`replaceItem` will replace the existing document with the new one. In this case, we'd intend the old and new to be the same other than `firstName`."
