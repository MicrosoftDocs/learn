In this module, you learned how to choose the best Azure NetApp Files service level for your EDA and HPC applications.

You reviewed the storage hierarchy of Azure NetApp Files and examined the key factors that determine Azure NetApp Files performance, such as service level, QoS, and volume quota. You learned how to calculate the required bandwidth of your applications. You also considered the service-level cost structure.

After you identified the throughput or IOPS requirements of the application, you were able to choose the best service level that blends performance and cost effectiveness. The Azure NetApp Files Performance Calculator is the tool you used to achieve this goal.
