quiz:
  questions:
  - content: "What's the top-down order of the Azure NetApp Files storage hierarchy?"
    choices:
    - content: "NetApp account -> container -> volume"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "There's no container concept in Azure NetApp Files."
    - content: "NetApp account -> capacity pool -> volume"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct."
    - content: "NetApp account -> capacity pool -> storage target"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "There's no storage target concept in Azure NetApp Files."
  - content: "After resizing Azure NetApp Files volume quota to reflect new performance requirements, what actions need to be done to make the change effective?"
    choices:
    - content: "Reboot the client VMs."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Azure NetApp Files reflects the performance effect automatically and almost immediately."
    - content: "Restart the Azure NetApp Files service."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Azure NetApp Files reflects the performance effect automatically and almost immediately."
    - content: "The performance change takes effect automatically and almost immediately."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Azure NetApp Files reflects the performance effect automatically and almost immediately."
  - content: What are the three key components of Azure NetApp Files volume performance?
    choices: 
      - content: Volume quota, service levels, quality of service.
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "Volume quotas impact the throughput per TiB. Service levels apply throttles to performance for cost efficiency. Quality of service is applied to a capacity pool and can be configured to allow higher performance for smaller volumes."
      - content: "Volume quota, capacity pools, user quotas."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Volume quotas impact the throughput per TiB. Capacity pools are how Azure NetApp Files allocates capacity and is billed. User quotas are used to control the capacity utilized by users of the service."
      - content: "Volume type, volume quota, file count."
        isCorrect: false 
        explanation: "Volume type can be regular or large and can impact performance, but isn't one of the key components. Volume quotas impact the throughput per TiB. File count refers to the number of files in the volume."
  - content: "A high-performance computing (HPC) application needs at least 50-TiB size of volume storage and also needs to ensure 5,000 MiB per second in throughput. Which of the following service levels and volume quotas are the best to be configured?"
    choices:
    - content: "Standard service level with a 75-TiB regular volume size."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This configuration can't meet throughput requirements."
    - content: "Premium service level with a 50-TiB large volume size."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "This configuration meets throughput requirements with the lowest capacity pool cost."
    - content: "Ultra service level with a 100-TiB large volume size."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This configuration meets throughput requirements but the capacity pool cost isn't the lowest."
