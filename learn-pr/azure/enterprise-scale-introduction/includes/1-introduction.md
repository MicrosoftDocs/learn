In the context of an enterprise-scale architecture, a _landing zone_ is a logical construct that captures everything that must be true to enable application migrations and development at scale in Azure. Landing zones consider all platform resources that are required to support a customer's application portfolio. Azure landing zones provide cloud adoption teams with a well-managed environment for their workloads.

A good analogy to a landing zone is the set of services that are required to build a city. Before buildings can be erected and people can move into them, certain essential services must be in place. Citizens and businesses need roads, water and sewer facilities, and power and gas infrastructure. 

The principal purpose of a landing zone is therefore to ensure that when an application or workload lands on Azure, the requisite _infrastructure_ is already in place. Infrastructure helps provide greater agility and compliance with enterprise security and governance requirements. It's a major shift for a centralized IT organization in this scenario to move from providing all the infrastructure (such as buildings for people to live or work in) to providing the zoning guidelines (guardrails that are established so that other business units can build their infrastructure and applications).

One of the main benefits of the cloud is that you can scale out resources on demand with almost no limit. You can also scale in resources when they aren't needed. It's analogous to turning a light on when you need it and off when you don't, so that you incur charges only for the electricity that's used while the light is on. 

Similarly, an organization can turn on an Azure resource when it's needed and turn it off when it's not. Azure provides broader options beyond on/off configurations, much like a switch that lets you control how much light to provide at any moment in time.

There's almost no capital cost associated with IT in the cloud, because hardware isn't being purchased to build a datacenter. Each resource is used on demand as needed. Because of this power to scale, governance problems can arise. The governance and organization of many resources at once becomes challenging. Imagine a library with a pile of books with no markings or sorting process. When you need a particular book, it's almost impossible to find. The library has to define the processes for sorting and returning books to their prescribed locations. 

The same idea applies to resources in Azure subscriptions, which must be properly organized for operational efficiency. Enterprise-scale architecture provides a set of prescriptive, proven guidelines to define a sustainable platform architecture for landing zones. At a library, we know where to find a book and, when we're done with it, where to return it. Likewise, we build landing zones so we know where to go, and we provision resources when we need them.  

Landing zones help with cloud adoption by creating better ways to organize resources, not just by type, but by organization, cost, and security.
