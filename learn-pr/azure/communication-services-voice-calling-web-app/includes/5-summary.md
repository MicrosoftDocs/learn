You've successfully created a web app that allows you to voice call other users using Azure Communication Services!

In this module you learned:

* What Azure Communication Services is and how to create an Azure Communication Services resource.
* How to create a basic web app that uses Azure Communication Services client SDKs.
* How to generate test credentials for your app.
* How to call both our echo bot and another user using your app.

## Clean up

If you want to clean up and remove a Communication Services subscription, you can delete the resource or resource group. Deleting the resource group also deletes any other resources associated with it.

The test credentials you generated have a short expiry and do not need to be invalidated.
