Microsoft provides free Azure DevOps accounts for individuals, small teams and open source projects. Enterprises can also sign up for Azure DevOps accounts that can scale to thousands of team members. We're going to sign up for a free Azure DevOps account to see how products can help us on our DevOps journey.

## Create an Azure DevOps account

> [!NOTE]
> If you already have an Azure DevOps account, you can skip the following section and move on to **Create a new project**

To create an Azure DevOps account, carry out the following procedure:

1. Open a browser window and navigate to the Azure DevOps website at [https://dev.azure.com](https://dev.azure.com?azure-portal=true).

1. Click the **Start free** button.

1. Sign in using your **Microsoft Account**, or if you do not have a Microsoft account, click **Create One!** and complete the steps to create a new Microsoft account.

> [!NOTE]
> You may have a Microsoft account already. Typically these might end with hotmail.com or outlook.com.

1. Review the Terms of Service, Privacy Statement, and Code of Conduct and click **Continue** if you agree to these.

Your new Azure DevOps account should be created. 

> [!NOTE]
> As the person creating the Azure DevOps account, you will automatically become the account owner. Please be considerate when deciding on your account name and avoid existing legal entities.

In the list of organizations on the left side of the page, you should see the new organization name shown. If you refer to the address bar in your browser, the address for your Azure DevOps account will be `https://dev.azure.com/<Orgname>`. If you do not see an organization name associated to your account. You will need to create a new organization.

## Create a new organization

1. Click the **Create new organization** button in the right pane.

1. Click **Continue** in the Azure DevOps Terms of Service and Privacy notification window.

1. Create a name for your organization next to the **`dev.azure.com/`** field.

1. Click **Continue**

This will create a new organization for your Azure DevOps projects which can be address bar of your browser in the format `https://dev.azure.com/<Orgname>`.

## Create a new project

Projects in Azure DevOps are generally synonymous with applications in your organization. It is good practice to avoid entering numbers in the project name. For example, try not to name your project something like Payroll 2.0 or Payroll 2018. A better approach would be to name your project **Payroll* and then 2.0 or 2018 are most likely just branches in your source code repository and iterations for your work items.

After completing the steps above to create a new Azure DevOps account, you should be presented with a screen titled "Create a project to get started". If you're using an existing Azure DevOps account, navigate to `https://dev.azure.com/<Orgname>` to be presented with the same screen.

1. Enter a name for your first project. We'll use **Contoso** as our project name.

1. Leave the visibility set to **Private** which means only accounts you add to this project will be able to access it. Choosing public may be a good choice for any Open Source projects you wish to create in the future.

1. Click the **Create project** button.

Congratulations! You have signed up for a new Azure DevOps account and created a new project. You can use your account to start learning more about Azure DevOps, and you will need this account if you want to continue learning more about Azure DevOps in future modules.

This is just the very beginning of our journey with DevOps using Azure DevOps.
