  questions:
  - content: 'What is a key difference between containers and virtual machines?'
    choices:
    - content: "Containers don't have their own internal operating system."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Containers share part of their operating system with their hosts."
    - content: "Containers and virtual machines are both made by Docker."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While Docker is a popular type of software for containers, Docker isn't a virtual machine."
    - content: "Both containers and virtual machines are propriety technology, and you must pay a license fee."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Docker is an open widely used standard that is free to use. Most virtual machines don't require a license fee payment."
    - content: "Both containers and virtual machines require C++ experience."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Containers and virtual machines are approachable for beginners and don't require extensive experience."
  - content: 'In a Kubernetes cluster, what is a deployed container stored in?'
    choices:
    - content: "A container registry."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A container registry stores containers, but it doesn't store deployed containers."
    - content: "The Kubernetes API server."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The Kubernetes API server manages the IP address, network rules, and exposed ports of the small deployable units that containers are stored in."
    - content: "A main container."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Kubernetes doesn't have a main container. Instead, it stores containers in small deployable units with no built-in intelligence."
    - content: "A pod."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Containers are self-contained and have the exact same container image when they're deployed, so they function the same on different machines."
  - content: 'What does an ingress controller do?'
    choices:
    - content: "Reduces the size of container images."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Ingress controllers aren't involved with building containers, only how they're deployed and able to be interacted with."
    - content: "Ingress controllers manage how to deploy and expose your applications to the world without the need to configure network-related services."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Ingress controllers allow your applications to be accessed by other applications."
    - content: "Provides automation for container registries to tag the latest image."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Ingress controllers work with Kubernetes to determine how your applications can be accessed."
    - content: "Determine the health of container images in order for Kubernetes to replace them as needed."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While ingress controllers allow access to your containers, they don't determine the health of them."
