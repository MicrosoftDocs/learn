In this module, you learned about orchestrating containers for cloud-native apps. You created a container registry, a Kubernetes cluster with AKS, and deployed a Docker container to the cluster. Then, you created manifest files to configure the cluster and allow API communication. You did all this while you also learned about services, containers, and other cloud services and concepts.


## Clean up resources

It's important that you clean up any unused resources. You're charged for the configured capacity not how much of the database is used. If you didn't delete your resource group in Unit 7, follow these instructions:

1. Navigate to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
2. Select **Resource Groups**, and then select the resource group that you created for this module.
3. On the **Overview** page, select **Delete resource group**.
4. Enter the name of the resource group, and then select **Delete** > **Delete**.
