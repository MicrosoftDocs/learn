  questions: 
  - content: "What is the primary purpose of customer-managed keys for Azure NetApp Files volume encryption?"
    choices: 
    - content: "To automate data migration between Azure regions."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Customer-managed keys aren't directly involved in automating data migration between Azure regions. These keys primarily focus on providing control and security over data encryption."
    - content: "To optimize storage performance and throughput."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Although customer-managed keys can indirectly contribute to storage performance and throughput by enabling encryption, their primary purpose is to provide control and security over data encryption."
    - content: "To provide control and security over data encryption."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Customer-managed keys provide greater control and security over data encryption. By managing and controlling the keys used for encryption and decryption, you can ensure data security and comply with your organization's security policies and regulatory requirements."
    - content: "To enable seamless integration with third-party backup solutions."
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: "Incorrect. Although customer-managed keys can be used with backup solutions, they aren't expressly designed for this purpose. Their primary purpose is to provide control and security over data encryption."
