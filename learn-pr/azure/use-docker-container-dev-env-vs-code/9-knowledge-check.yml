  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
    - content: "After you've added a dev container configuration to a project, how do you open that project in the container?"
      choices:
        - content: "The project automatically opens in the container."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Although Visual Studio Code might notify you that it _can_ open the project in a dev container, it won't open in the container by default."
        - content: "Select **Add Development Configuration Files** from the Command Palette."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "This command will add a dev container configuration. There's already a container definition present according to the question."
        - content: "Use the **Reopen in Container** option in Visual Studio Code."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "The **Reopen in Container** option, from either the Visual Studio Code notification or the Command Palette, will load the project in the dev container."
        - content: "Start the project from the terminal."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Starting the project won't automatically start the container."
    - content: "How do you run additional commands after the dev container has been created?"
      choices:
        - content: "Use the postCreateCommand property in the devcontainer.json"
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "The postCreatecommand is for any command that you want to have run immediately after the container is created."
        - content: "Use the post-install hook in the devcontainer.json"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "There's no postCreate install hook in the devcontainer.json"
        - content: "Specify the command in the Dockerfile"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "While you can run additional commands in the Dockerfile, the preferred way is to use the devcontainer.json file."
        - content: "Pass the postCreate flag to the build command."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "The recommended way to execute post create commands is with the devcontainer.json file."
    - content: "How would you install additional software in a container so that it persists your changes even after rebuilding?"
      choices:
        - content: "Use an `apt-get` command in the devcontainer.json file's `postSetupCommand` option."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "The devcontainer.json file is primarily for project-specific configuration, and not the place to run commands like `apt-get`."
        - content: "Use the `apt-get` command in the Dockerfile's `postSetupCommand` option."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "The `postSetupCommand` option is available only in the devcontainer.json file."
        - content: "Install the software after the container loads via the terminal."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Although it will work, it will be isolated to your container and not saved with the project configuration."
        - content: "Use a Dev Container Feature."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "The most efficient practice that persists your changes even after rebuilding is to install software through a Dev Container Feature."
