- Installed the Dev Containers extension in Visual Studio Code and used its commands. These commands included adding container configuration files, reopening your app in a container, and rebuilding your container after making changes.
- Explored the files that make up your container configuration.
- Customized your container and development experience by forwarding ports, changing settings, and installing additional software.
