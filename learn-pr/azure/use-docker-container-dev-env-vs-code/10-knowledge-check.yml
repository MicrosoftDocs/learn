  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
    - content: "When you add a dev container configuration to a project, how do you open that project in the container?"
      choices:
        - content: "The project automatically opens in the container."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Although Visual Studio Code might notify you that it _can_ open the project in a dev container, it won't open in the container by default."
        - content: "Select **Add Development Configuration Files** from the Command Palette."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "This command will add a dev container configuration, but it won't open the project in the container."
        - content: "Use the **Reopen in Container** option in Visual Studio Code."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "The **Reopen in Container** option, from either the Visual Studio Code notification or the Command Palette, will load the project in the dev container."
        - content: "Start the project from the terminal."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Starting the project won't automatically start the container."
    - content: "When you start a web project in a container, how do you access it from the browser?"
      choices:
        - content: "Use the port forwarding feature of dev containers."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Port forwarding allows you to access any port exposed in a container as if it's on your local machine."
        - content: "Open a browser instance in the container."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "The container does not have a user interface, so it's not possible to open a browser instance inside one."
        - content: "Access it the same way as you would any other web project or URL."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "By default, applications exposed via URLs with ports like 127.0.0.1:5000 are not accessible from your local machine."
        - content: "Expose the port in the Dockerfile."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Although you _can_ expose ports in a Dockerfile, it's not the best way to expose processes running in a dev container."
    - content: "How would you install additional software in a container so that it's saved as part of the configuration?"
      choices:
        - content: "Use an `apt-get` command in the devcontainer.json file's `postSetupCommand` option."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "The devcontainer.json file is primarily for project-specific configuration, and not the place to run commands like `apt-get`."
        - content: "Use the `apt-get` command in the Dockerfile's `postSetupCommand` option."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "The `postSetupCommand` option is available only in the devcontainer.json file."
        - content: "Install the software after the container loads via the terminal."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Although this will work, it will be isolated to your container and not saved with the project configuration."
        - content: "Add a `RUN apt-get` command in the Dockerfile."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "The Dockerfile is the right place to install additional software. Using the Dockerfile `RUN` command allows you to use the `apt-get` package manager."
