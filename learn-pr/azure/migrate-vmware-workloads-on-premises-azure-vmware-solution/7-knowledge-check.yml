quiz:
  questions:
  - content: "Let's say Monica has vSphere 5.5 deployed within an on-premises VMware environment. What needs to be done to deploy VMware HCX?"
    choices:
    - content: "Deploy and downgrade the VMware HCX connector appliance on-premises to get support for the migration."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Monica must deploy and downgrade the VMware HCX Connector appliance on-premises, which allows for a supported migration pattern into Azure VMware Solution."
    - content: "VMware HCX can't be deployed to conduct any migrations into Azure VMware Solution."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "VMware HCX can still be used for an older vSphere version."
    - content: "Deploy Azure VMware Solution in a different region."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "While possible, deploying Azure VMware Solution to a different region won't help migrate VMs from vSphere 5.5 to Azure VMware Solution."
  - content: "Alberto can't successfully establish a VMware HCX site pairing. What might be the issue?"
    choices:
    - content: "Download the VMware HCX Connector OVA file again."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "If Alberto is at this step in the process, VMware HCX downloaded correctly."
    - content: "The VMware HCX Connector OVA file needs redeployment on-premises."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "If Alberto is at this step in the process, VMware HCX deployed correctly."
    - content: "The VMware HCX Connector can't route to Alberto's VMware HCX Cloud Manager IP over port 443."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "The ability to route traffic over port 443 must be accounted for if Alberto can't establish a VMware HCX site pairing."
  - content: "For the VMware HCX Connector to route to the VMware HCX Cloud Manager environment, which port needs to be open?"
    choices:
    - content: "443"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Port 443 needs to be open between the on-premises VMware HCX Connector and the VMware HCX Cloud Manager environment in Azure VMware Solution."
    - content: "3389"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Port 3389 is for Remote Desktop Protocol, and doesn't have to do with the HCX Connector on-premises routing traffic to the VMware HCX Cloud Manager environment."
    - content: "53"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Port 53 is for DNS, and doesn't have to do with the VMware HCX Connector on-premises routing traffic to the VMware HCX Cloud Manager environment."
  - content: "Sai can't create a service mesh within VMware HCX. What might be the issue?"
    choices:
    - content: "Check permissions on the subscription and resource group."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This issue involves VMware HCX directly, not any permissions in the Azure portal."
    - content: "Ports UDP 500/4500 aren't open between the on-premises and Azure VMware Solution network profiles."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "UDP ports 500/4500 need to be open between the on-premises and Azure VMware Solution 'uplink' network profiles."
    - content: "Redeploy VMware HCX on-premises to connect to Azure VMware Solution."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Redeploying the VMware HCX appliance on-premises won't help create the service mesh."
