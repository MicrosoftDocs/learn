- Deploy and configure VMware HCX Connector on-premises.

From there, you learned how to create the following components to migrate VMs:

- Create a site pairing.
- Configure a networking profile.
- Configure a compute profile.
- Establish a service mesh.

Finally, you learned how to migrate VMs from an on-premises VMware vSphere environment to Azure VMware Solution.
