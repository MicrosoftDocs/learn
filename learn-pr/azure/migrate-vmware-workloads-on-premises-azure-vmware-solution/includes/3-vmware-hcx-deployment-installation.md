Remember that VMware HCX deploys as an add-on option after Azure VMware Solution deploys in Azure. Before configuring site pairings for your migration, use the next steps for deployment and configuration of VMware HCX Connector on-premises. 

To complete the exercises, you need access to an Azure subscription with contributor rights assigned to configure an Azure VMware Solution environment.

## Download VMware HCX Connector

Before you deploy VMware HCX Connector in the on-premises vCenter Server, download the VMware HCX Connector OVA file from the Azure portal.

1. Search for and select the Azure VMware Solution private cloud in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

1. Under **Manage**, select **Add-ons**.

1. Select the **Migration using VMware HCX** tab, place a check mark next to **I agree with terms and conditions**, and select **Enable and deploy**.

1. This action triggers a deployment of VMware HCX within the Azure VMware Solution private cloud.

1. After the deployment completes, you should see a similar screen to the following image:

1. Within the Azure VMware Solution resource, under **Manage**, select **Add-ons** again.

1. In the **Migration using HCX** tab, you should now have **HCX plan**, **Configure HCX appliance**, and **Connect with on-premise using HCX keys**. These new options for configuration were built out during the HCX deployment on the private cloud.

1. Select **+ Add** under **Connect with on-premise using HCX keys** to generate a key that you use for the on-premises HCX Connector installation.

1. Supply a VMware HCX key name and you see the activation key shows up within this pane. This key is used to activate the on-premises VMware HCX Connector appliance.

1. Use the *cloudadmin@vsphere.local* user credentials to sign in.

1. Within VMware HCX Cloud Manager, select **Administration** > **System Updates** > **Check for Updates**.

1. After VMware HCX checks for a software update, select **Request Download Link**.

## Activate VMware HCX

After deploying and powering on the VMware HCX Connector appliance on-premises, you activate VMware HCX Connector. You need to get a license key from the Azure VMware Solution environment in Azure.

1. Under **Manage** > **Add-ons**, select the **Migration using VMware HCX tab**, then select **+ Add**.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/3-add-vmware-hcx-activation-key-portal.png" alt-text="Screenshot to add the VMware HCX Advanced key in the Azure portal."lightbox="../media/3-add-vmware-hcx-activation-key-portal.png":::

1. Provide a name for the key and wait for Azure to generate a VMware HCX Enterprise key for use on-premises.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/3-request-vmware-hcx-activation-key.png" alt-text="Screenshot after the VMware HCX Advanced key is requested from the Azure portal."lightbox="../media/3-request-vmware-hcx-activation-key.png":::

1. Use the admin credentials you configured earlier to sign in to the on-premises VMware HCX Manager at `https://x.x.x.x:9443`. Replace the x's with the IP address configured for the on-premises appliance.

1. When prompted, enter your **HCX License Key**, then select **Add**. If you receive any errors during activation, the on-premises environment might not have open internet access or a proxy configured for activation. Check internet connectivity if VMware HCX Connector on-premises doesn't activate.
