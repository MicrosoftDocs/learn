In this unit, we'll distinguish between the different types of server-side Java applications that will help you to choose a matching cloud solution.

## Monolithic applications

A monolithic application is  an *All in One* solution that still fits for many projects. A monolithic application is a good start for prototyping and startups. It's simple to develop, easy to debug and to test, and simple to deploy.

Traditionally your monolithic applications run on application servers and scale the entire application as a whole.

## Microservices

Today businesses are asked to adapt and fail fast and expect the unexpected to succeed. To achieve a reduced time to market, more engineers get hired. But the outcome might be the opposite! It results in a higher time to market as you do have more communication effort when more engineers need to collaborate. The solution here is to divide and conquer.

In a cross-functional team, you can deliver features as independently as possible. Each team should be responsible for their own dedicated part of their software.

## Batch

Some applications are intended to run briefly. They execute a particular workload, and then exit rather than wait for requests or user input. Batch jobs are a solution for this use-case. Even though some batches can last for hours. Sometimes jobs need to run once or at regular, scheduled intervals.

## Serverless

Functions are only executed on an event. A function is "triggered" by a specific type of event. Supported triggers include responding to changes in data, responding to messages, running on a schedule, or as the result of an HTTP request.
