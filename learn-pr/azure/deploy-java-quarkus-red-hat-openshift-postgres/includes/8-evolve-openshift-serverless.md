In this module, you'll explore the possibility of transforming your ToDo list application into a serverless function. Serverless functions offer several advantages, including cost-efficiency, reliability, flexibility, and enhanced security. We'll guide you through the process of deploying your application on [Red Hat OpenShift Serverless](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift/serverless).

By the end of this module, you'll not only have a well-functioning ToDo list application deployed on ARO, but you'll also gain the knowledge and skills to potentially evolve it into a serverless function on Red Hat OpenShift Serverless.

## Red Hat OpenShift Serverless

[Red Hat OpenShift Serverless](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift/serverless) is a platform-as-a-service (PaaS) offering from Red Hat that allows developers to build, deploy, and manage serverless functions on top of the OpenShift Kubernetes platform. It provides a simplified and managed environment for running event-driven, stateless applications without the need to provision or manage underlying infrastructure.

Key features and benefits of OpenShift Serverless:

* **Serverless architecture**: Enables developers to focus on writing code without worrying about infrastructure management.
* **Event-driven**: Functions are triggered by events, such as HTTP requests, message queue messages, or timers.
* **Scalability**: Automatically scales functions up or down based on demand, ensuring optimal resource utilization.
* **Managed environment**: Red Hat manages the underlying infrastructure, including Kubernetes, serverless runtime, and networking.
* **Integration with OpenShift**: Seamlessly integrates with other OpenShift services, such as OpenShift Pipelines for CI/CD and OpenShift Service Mesh for service-to-service communication.

Let's see all these concepts in action by creating the Todo application using OpenShift Serverless.
