  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:

  - content: "Suppose a software solution has two critical components. The first component is a web application. The second is a service that processes online orders. The two components are both part of an online order processing pipeline, but doesn't have a dependency on each other. Which strategy would fit the deployment of these two applications best using Helm?"
    choices:
    - content: "Create a single Helm chart that for both applications, but don't set either chart as a dependency of the other."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "When you deploy a Helm chart, the applications deployed in the chart are deployed as a release. A single release can make it difficult to manage upgrades and fixes to each component independently."
    - content: "Create two separate Helm charts. One for each of the applications."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "When you deploy a Helm chart, the applications deployed in the chart are deployed as a release. By splitting the deployment across two charts, this strategy allows you to manage each component in a separate development life cycle for upgrades and fixes."
    - content: "Create a single Helm chart for both applications, and set the service that process the orders as a dependency chart."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "When you deploy a Helm chart, the applications deployed in the chart are deployed as a release. A single release can make it difficult to manage upgrades and fixes to each component independently."

  - content: "Suppose a software solution makes use of website as one of its critical components. The website is the only component that depends on a caching service. Which strategy would fit the deployment of these two applications best using Helm?"
    choices:
    - content: "Create two separate Helm charts. One for each of the applications."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "By splitting the deployment across two charts, this strategy allows you to manage each component in a separate development life cycle. However, since there's a direct dependency between the website and the caching service, a better approach would be to deploy these components as a single Helm release."
    - content: "Create a single Helm chart to deploy the website. Deploy the caching service as a separate component by using deployment manifest files."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "By managing the dependent caching service outside of the website's Helm chart, will make it difficult to manage the deployment of the website. There's a direct dependency between the website and the caching service and a better approach would be to deploy these components as a single Helm release."
    - content: "Create a single Helm chart for both applications, and set the caching service as a dependency chart."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "When you deploy a Helm chart, the applications deployed in the chart are deployed as a release. A single release can make it easier to manage upgrades and fixes to the components that have dependencies."
