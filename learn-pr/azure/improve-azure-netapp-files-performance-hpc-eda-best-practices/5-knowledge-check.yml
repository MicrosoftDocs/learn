  questions:
  - content: "Which mount option would you use to improve performance if an Azure NetApp Files volume contains static data with heavy read workloads?"
    choices:
    - content: "nconnect"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "nconnect is to increase number of TCP network connections of NFS client."
    - content: "rsize and wsize"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "wsize and rsize determine how much data is sent between the NFS client and server for each packet sent."
    - content: "nocto and actimeo"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "It's recommended to use nocto and actimeo on static data volumes with and massive read operations."

      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "It's generally recommended to set both rsize and wsize value as 262144 (256 K) in the mount options."
    - content: "rsize=262144,wsize=262144 (256 K/256 K)"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "It's generally recommended to set both rsize and wsize value as 262144 (256 K) in the mount options."
    - content: "rsize=65536,wsize=65536 (64 K/64 K)"
