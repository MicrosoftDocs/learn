quiz:
  questions:
  - content: "Which mount option would you use to improve performance if an Azure NetApp Files volume contains static data with heavy read workloads?"
    choices:
    - content: "`nconnect`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "`nconnect` can increase the number of TCP network connections for NFS clients."
    - content: "`rsize` and `wsize`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "`rsize` and `wsize` determine how much data is sent between the NFS client and the server for each packet sent."
    - content: "`nocto` and `actimeo`"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "We recommend using `nocto` and `actimeo` on static data volumes with massive read operations."
  - content: "You want to increase the number of parallel TCP network connections per NFS mount on NFS client VMs. Which mount option should you use?"
    choices:
    - content: "`nconnect`"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "`nconnect` can increase the number of parallel TCP network connections for NFS clients."
    - content: "`rsize` and `wsize`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "`rsize` and `wsize` determine how much data is sent between the NFS client and the server for each packet sent."
    - content: "`nocto` and `actimeo`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "We recommend using `nocto` and `actimeo` on static data volumes with massive read operations."
  - content: "What are the general recommendations for `rsize` and `wsize` values in mount options, for optimal performance?"
    choices:
    - content: "`rsize=1048576,wsize=1448576(1 MB/1 MB)`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "We generally recommend that you set both `rsize` and `wsize` values as `262144(256 K)` in the mount options."
    - content: "`rsize=262144,wsize=262144(256 K/256 K)`"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "We generally recommend that you set both `rsize` and `wsize` values as `262144(256 K)` in the mount options."
    - content: "`rsize=65536,wsize=65536(64 K/64 K)`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "We generally recommend that you set both `rsize` and `wsize` values as `262144(256 K)` in the mount options."
  - content: "Why would you avoid using the `sync` mount option in EDA workloads?"
    choices:
    - content: "It causes data loss in the event of an outage."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Using the `sync` mount option reduces overall performance due to the order of `WRITE`` operations."
    - content: "It reduces overall performance."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Using the `sync` mount option reduces overall performance due to the order of `WRITE`` operations."
    - content: "It sends larger block sizes to the NFS server."
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: "Using the `sync` mount option reduces overall performance due to the order of `WRITE`` operations."
  - content: "How many WRITE operations would be sent to an Azure NetApp Files volume if creating a 1-GiB file using an 8 K block size on an NFS mount with 256 K wsize and async mount options?"
    choices:
    - content: "4096 (1048576/256)"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "When using the async mount option, data maximizes the available `wsize` and block sizes combine into the available size of 256 K."
    - content: "4 (1048576/262144)"
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: "When using the async mount option, data maximizes the available `wsize` and block sizes combine into the available size of 256 K."
    - content: "131072 (1048576/8)"
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: "When using the async mount option, data maximizes the available `wsize` and block sizes combine into the available size of 256 K."
