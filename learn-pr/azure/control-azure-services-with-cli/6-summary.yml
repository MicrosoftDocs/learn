  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:

  - content: "What do you need to install on your machine to let you execute Azure CLI commands locally?"
    choices:
    - content: "The Azure Cloud Shell"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The Cloud Shell does let you execute Azure CLI commands; however, you use the Cloud Shell in a browser, so you are not running the commands on your local machine."
    - content: "The Azure CLI and Azure PowerShell"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "You can run CLI commands from a PowerShell prompt; however, PowerShell is not required to run the CLI locally."
    - content: "Only the Azure CLI"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "You only need to install the Azure CLI. You will use a shell to issue the CLI commands, but every platform has at least one built-in shell."

  - content: "True or false: The Azure CLI can be installed on Linux, macOS, and Windows, and the CLI commands you use are the same in all platforms."
    choices:
    - content: "True"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "The CLI is cross-platform and can be installed on Linux, macOS, and Windows. After installation, the CLI commands that you run are the same everywhere. This means you can learn the commands once and use them with any local installation or in the Azure Cloud Shell."
    - content: "False"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The CLI provides the same set of commands everywhere it is available."

  - content: "Which parameter value can you add to most CLI commands to get concise, formatted output?"
    choices:
    - content: "list"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The list subcommand displays the details of a resource, it does not control output format."
    - content: "table"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "The table parameter formats the output as a table. This can make things much more readable for commands that produce a large amount of output."
    - content: "group"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The group command lets you control resource groups, it does not influence output format."
