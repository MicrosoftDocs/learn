Azure Container Instance enables you to run a Docker image in Azure.

In the previous exercise, you packaged and tested your web app as a local Docker image. Now, you want to use the output of that exercise and make the web application available globally. To accomplish this availability, you can run the image as an Azure Container Instance.

In this exercise, you'll learn how to rebuild the image for the web app and upload it to Azure Container Registry. You'll use the Azure Container Instance service to run the image.

## Create a container registry

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/learn.docs.microsoft.com?azure-portal=true) with your Azure subscription.

1. On the resource menu or from the **Home** page, select **Create a resource**. The **Create a resource** pane appears.

1. In the menu, search for and select **Container Registry**.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/7-search-container-registry.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows Create a resource with Container Registry.":::

    The **Create container registry** pane appears.

1. On the **Basics** tab, enter the following values for each setting.

    | Setting  | Value  |
    |---|---|
    | **Project details** |
    | Subscription | Select your Azure subscription in which you're allowed to create and manage resources. |
    | Resource group | Select Create a new resource group with the name **learn-deploy-container-aci-rg**. Remember the name you select; you'll be using it in the rest of the exercises in this module. Also, remember to clean up this resource when you're finished with the module. |
    | **Instance details** |
    | Registry name | Select a name of your choice. The registry name must be unique within Azure, and contain 5-50 alphanumeric characters. |
    | Location | Select a location that's close to you. |
    | Use availability zones | Accept the default. |
    | Pricing plan | **Standard** |

1. Leave all other options as their defaults, then select **Review + create**. When the *Validation passed* notification appears, select **Create**. Wait until the container registry has been deployed before continuing.

1. Select **Go to resource**. The *Container registry* pane displays essentials about your container registry.

1. In the resource menu, under **Settings**, select **Access keys**. The **Access keys** pane for your container registry appears.

1. If the **Admin user** setting is disabled, check the box next to the **Admin user** access key. The **Username** and passwords appear for your container registry.

1. Make a note of the **Registry name**, **Login server**, **Username**, and **passwords** for your container registry.

    > [!NOTE]
    > In this exercise, we enable the admin account access so that we can upload images and test the registry. In a production environment, it's important to disable the **Admin user** account access and use Microsoft Entra ID Protection as soon as you're satisfied that the registry is operating as expected.

## Upload the image for the hotel reservation system app to Azure Container Registry

1. In your local command prompt, run the following command, replacing `<registry-name>` with the name of your container registry to tag the current `reservationsystem` image with the name of your registry:

    ```bash
    docker tag reservationsystem:latest <registry-name>.azurecr.io/reservationsystem:latest
    ```
 
1. Run the `docker image ls` command to verify that the image has been tagged correctly:

    ```bash
    docker image ls
    ```

    You should see something similar to the following output:

    ```console
    REPOSITORY                                    TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
    reservationsystem                             latest              a56281e7038f        4 minutes ago       1.76GB
    <registry-name>.azurecr.io/reservationsystem  latest              a56281e7038f        4 minutes ago       1.76GB
    ```

1. In the command prompt, sign in to your Azure Container Registry. Use the `docker login` command and specify the login server for the registry that you noted earlier. Enter the username and password from your access keys when prompted.

    ```bash
    docker login <login-server>
    ```

    >[!NOTE]
    >You might receive an error response from a daemon that your application is not registered with Microsoft Entra ID. As noted earlier in this exercise, you've enabled **Admin user** access key to test our deployment.

1. Enter the following command, replacing `<registry-name>` with your own registry name to upload the image to your registry in Azure Container Registry:

    ```bash
    docker push <registry-name>.azurecr.io/reservationsystem:latest
    ```

    Wait until the upload completes. This process will take several minutes to push all the objects of the image to your repository. You can observe the progress as each object advances from *Waiting* to *Preparing* to *Pushing* to *Pushed*.

## Verify the registry contents

For the remainder of the exercise, you'll return to the Azure portal.

1. In the Azure portal, return to your container registry.

1. In the resource menu, under **Services**, select **Repositories**. The **Repositories** pane for your container registry appears.

1. Verify that the **reservationsystem** repository appears. Select the **reservationsystem** repository and verify that the repository contains an image with the tag **latest**.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/7-repository.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the repository and tagged reservation system container image in the registry.":::

## Load and run an image using Azure Container Instance

1. In the Azure portal, select **Create a resource**. The **Create a resource** pane appears.

1. In the resource menu, select **Containers**, and then select **Container Instances**.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/7-search-container-instance.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing Container Instances.":::

    The **Create container instance** pane appears.

    There are several steps to configure a Container Instance. Start by setting the resource group information and container details. Next, configure the container's network options, and restart the policy.

1. On the **Basics** tab, enter the following values for each setting.

    | Setting  | Value  |
    |---|---|
    | **Project details** |

    | DNS name label scope reuse | Accept default |
    | **Ports** | |
    | Ports | 80 |
    | Ports protocol | TCP |

1. Select the **Advanced** tab.

1. On the **Advanced** tab, enter the following values for each setting.

    | Setting  | Value  |
    |---|---|
    | Restart policy | Always |
    | Environment variables| *leave all settings blank* |
    | Command override | *leave blank* |

1. Select **Review + create**. Wait for validation to complete, and correct any errors, if necessary.

1. Select **Create**.

1. When the container instance has been created, select **Go to resource**. Your container instance pane appears.

1. On the **Overview** pane, find the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the container instance.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/7-container-fqdn.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the New pane in Azure portal showing the Container properties with the FQDN highlighted.":::

1. Using a web browser, navigate to the URL `http://FQDN/api/reservations/1`, replacing  *FQDN* with the fully qualified domain name of your container instance. For example, using the visible FQDN in the screenshot above would look like:

    ```output
    http://hotel.southcentralus.azurecontainer.io/api/reservations/1
    ```

    The web app should respond with a JSON object containing the details for reservation 1.

Congratulations! You uploaded the Docker image to Azure Container Registry, and you ran the image using the Azure Container Instance service.
