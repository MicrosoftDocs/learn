A deployment slot is an instance of a web app in which you can test a new app version before you deploy it. By swapping slots, you can deploy a new version of an app without any downtime.

Let's suppose you decide to use Azure App Service deployment slots to streamline the deployment of new versions of your social media web app. You want to set up the web app in Azure and configure one or more deployment slots.

In this exercise, you set up a web app, add a new deployment slot for staging, and deploy different versions of the web app to the production and staging slots.

## Create a web app

Start by creating a new web app resource in the Azure portal.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/?azure-portal=true).

1. In the resource menu, or from the **Home** page, select **Create a resource**. The **Create a resource** pane appears.

1. In the resource menu, select **Web**, and from the results, select **Web App**. The **Create Web App** pane appears.

1. On the **Basics** tab, enter the following values for each setting.

    | Setting | Value |
    |---|---|
    | **Project Details** |
    | Subscription | Select the subscription you'd like to use to complete the exercise |
    | Resource Group | Select the **Create new** link, and enter **mslearn-slots**, and select **OK**. |
    | **Instance Details** |
    | Name | Enter a unique name. |
    | Publish | Code |

    | Setting | Value |
    |---|---|
    | **Application Insights** |
    | Enable Application Insights | Toggle to **No** |

1. Select **Review + create**, and then select **Create**. Wait until deployment succeeds.

1. When deployment completes, select **Go to resource**. The **App Service** pane for your web app appears.

## Configure git deployment

Although you can use many different tools to deploy code to your web app, in this exercise, you set up the web app to use a local git repository.

1. In the App Service menu, under **Deployment**, select **Deployment Center**. The **Deployment Center** pane for your app service appears.

1. On the **Settings** tab, for **Source**, select **Local Git**, and then select **Save** on the command bar to set up your deployment.

1. Select the **Local Git/FTPS credentials** tab. Under **User scope**, enter a unique username and password of your choice, and then in the command bar, select **Save**. Make a note of the username and password for later.

## Configure the git client and clone the web app source code

Now, you set up the git client in Cloud Shell and use it to clone a sample web app.

1. In the Azure global controls at the top of the page, select the Cloud Shell icon to launch an Azure Cloud Shell session.

      :::image type="content" source="../media/3-cloud-shell-icon.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Cloud Shell icon in global controls.":::

1. In the Cloud Shell session, when prompted, select the **Bash** experience and create storage for your subscription.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Cloud Shell requires an Azure storage resource to persist any files that you create in Cloud Shell. When you first open Cloud Shell, you're prompted to create a resource group, storage account, and Azure Files share. This setup is automatically used for all future Cloud Shell sessions.
   
1. Enter the following command in the Cloud Shell, replacing \<your-username> with your preferred username. This config value isn't associated with any Azure account, so you can use whatever value you like.

    ```bash
    git config --global user.name <your-username>
    ```

1. Enter the following command in the Cloud Shell, replacing \<your-email-address> with your preferred email address. This config value isn't associated with any Azure account, so you can use whatever value you like.
   
    ```bash
    git config --global user.email <your-email-address>
    ```
    
1. Enter the following code to create and open a `demoapp` folder for the source code.

    ```bash
    mkdir demoapp
    cd demoapp
    ```

1. Enter the following code to clone the source for the web app and open your local copy.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/app-service-web-dotnet-get-started.git
    cd app-service-web-dotnet-get-started
    ```

## Configure a git remote to deploy the app to production

We're going to use git to deploy the source code to the web app's production slot and then set up your app's git URL as a remote repository.

1. In the Azure portal, your web app should be active. In the resource menu, select **Overview**. 

1. In the Overview pane for your web app, the **Essentials** section has a URL in the **Default domain**. The URL contains your deployment name for the web app.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/3-copy-git-clone-url.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Essentials section, where you Copy the git clone URL." lightbox="../media/3-copy-git-clone-url.png":::

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you don't see a git clone URL in the location shown in the preceding screenshot, refresh the portal.

1. Hover over the  **Git clone url** and select the *Copy to clipboard* icon. This value also contains your deployment username.

1. In Cloud Shell, run the following command to configure the git remote with the name `production`. Replace `\<git-clone-url>` with the content you copied to the clipboard from the previous step.

    ```bash
    cd app-service-web-dotnet-get-started
    git remote add production <git-clone-url>
    ```

1. Run the following command to deploy the web app to the production slot. When you're prompted for the password, enter deployment password you created in the previous task.

    ```bash
    git push production
    ```

   The terminal session identifies all the processes that take place as part of the deployment. Wait until deployment completes. You should see a **Deployment successful** notification.

1. In the Azure portal, the **Overview** pane should still be active. Hover over the **URL**. You can either double-click it to open it in a new browser tab or copy and paste it into a new browser tab.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/3-web-app-production-slot.png" alt-text="Screenshot of your web app in the production slot.":::

1. Close the browser tab that displays the web app.

## Create a new staging slot

For your web app, you created one slot, the production slot, and you deployed source code to this slot. Let's create a deployment slot where you can stage new versions of your web app.

1. On the Azure portal menu, select **Home**, and in **Azure services**, select **All resources**. Filter by **Type == App Service**, and then select **Apply**.

1. Sort the result by **Type**, and then select the App Service that you created. The **App Service** pane for your web app appears.

1. In the App Service menu, under **Deployment**, select **Deployment slots**. The **Deployment slots** pane for your App Service appears.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/3-access-deployment-slots.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the App Service menu with Deployment slots highlighted.":::

1. In the command bar, select **+ Add Slot**. The **Add a slot** pane appears.

1. In the **Name** field, enter *staging*, accept the default for **Clone settings from**, and then select **Add**.

1. After the deployment slot is successfully created, select **Close**.

## Set up git deployment for the staging slot

Let's set up the new slot so that it uses git deployment.

1. On the Azure portal, select **Home** page, and then from Azure services, select **All resources**. 

1. Sort the resources by **Resource group**. for the resource group **mslearn-slots**, there are two App Service types. Deployment slots are represented as separate apps in the portal.

1. Select the staging slot. The Overview pane for your App Service (Slot) appears.

1. In the Staging menu, under **Deployment**, select **Deployment Center**.

1. On the **Settings** tab, for **Source**, select **Local Git**, and then select **Save** in the command bar to set up the deployment for staging.

1. On the resulting **Deployment Center** pane, select the **Local Git/FTPS credentials** tab.

1. Under **User scope**, enter a username and password of your choice, and then select **Save**. Azure updates user credentials. Make a note of the username and password for later.

## Set up git to deploy the app to the staging slot

To use the git client to deploy source code to the new slot, let's add an extra remote to the git configuration.

1. In the **App Service** menu, select **Overview**. If you're prompted to save the password for the username you created in the previous task, select **Save**.

1. On the **Overview** pane, in the **Essentials** section, hover over the **Git clone url** value and select the *Copy to clipboard* icon. The URL contains your staging deployment username.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you don't see the git clone URL, refresh the portal. The **Git clone url** for staging differs slightly from the URL for the production slot, and it includes the slot name.

1. In Cloud Shell, make sure you are in the ~/demoapp/app-service-web-dotnet-get-started folder, and then run the following command, replacing \<git-clone-uri> with the URL you copied in the previous step.

    ```bash
    git remote add staging <git-clone-uri>
    ```

## Modify the app source code and deploy the app to the staging slot

Next, let's make a small change to the web app files, and then use git to deploy the new version to the staging slot:

1. In Cloud Shell, run the following command.

    ```bash
    code .
    ```

1. In the list of **FILES**, expand **aspnet-get-started** > **Views** > **Home** folders, and select **Index.cshtml**.

1. Locate the following HTML.

    ```html
    <h1>ASP.NET</h1>
    ```

1. Replace that code with this HTML.

    ```html
    <h1>Web App Version 2</h1>
    ```

1. Press <kbd>Ctrl+S</kbd> to save your changes, and then press <kbd>Ctrl+Q</kbd> to close the editor.

1. In Cloud Shell, run the following code to commit the new version of the app to git, and deploy it to the staging slot. 

    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "New version of web app."
    git push staging
    ```

    When prompted, enter your deployment password. Notifications of the operations to create and deploy the staging display in the Cloud Shell session, and should display **Deployment successful**.

## Browse the staging slot

Now you can view the new version of the web app by browsing to the URL for the staging deployment slot.

1. In the Azure portal, on the **Overview** pane for the staging slot, select **Browse** from the command bar, or select the URL in the **Default domain**. The home page for staging **Web App Version 2** appears in a browser tab.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/3-web-app-staging-slot.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the updated web app in the staging slot.":::

Congratulations, you just created a staging slot that has its own version of the Web App code, and you can run tests on it. Remember that the production slot has the previous web app version, and users can't yet see your new code.
