Imagine that you're a security engineer for a large tax preparation company. You're responsible for a set of Windows and Linux virtual machines (VMs) located all over the world that customers use to prepare their business and personal taxes. You also manage a wide variety of devices and computers that employees use to communicate and do their daily tasks.

These servers and personal devices are common targets for attack. Once a hacker gets access to a single computer on your network, they can begin to infiltrate all of your data. Your job is to lock down these local and cloud servers. Already, you ensure that the surface area is minimized, and that common attack vectors are closed. Now, after exploring the features of **Microsoft Defender for Cloud** to analyze your network and cloud resources, you decide to use some of its built-in features to protect your VMs and computing hardware.

## Learning objectives

- Learn how to protect VM-based resources and networks with Microsoft Defender for Cloud.
- Install and use malware protection to stop virus attacks on your exposed endpoints.

## Prerequisites
