Computer systems that interact directly with users are considered _endpoint systems_. Systems on devices, such as laptops, smartphones, tablets, and computers, all need to be secured to help prevent them from acting as gateways for security attacks on an organization's networked systems. In today's world of *bring-your-own-devices*, that even means protecting personal devices that have access to your business resources.

News is filled with stories about how organizations have leaked personal information. Often, those accidents were the result of poor security practices or deliberate attacks. Hackers gain access to systems by impersonating a real user, or by somehow inserting _malware_ into a computer or device that has authorized access to the network.

## What is malware?

Malware is malicious software intended to cause damage to a computer or network. It often exploits vulnerabilities in software or unsuspecting users who unknowingly install it.

Malware comes in several forms:

- Viruses
- Worms
- Trojan horses

### Viruses

A computer virus, like a live virus, requires a *host* to live in. Viruses are bits of code that attach to existing programs and documents or hide in protected areas of your hard drive, such as the boot sector, making them hard to find and remove. When the infected program is launched, the virus is executed (often without the user noticing anything) and can perform malicious actions on the user's data or other files. If an infected computer sends a file to another computer, it can spread the virus with the data. This behavior is what classifies a computer virus: it lives inside other programs and requires human interaction to spread.

Some examples of viruses have been ILOVEYOU, Shamoon, and CIH (Chernobyl virus).

### Worms

A worm is a piece of standalone software that copies itself through a computer network. The behavior of a worm is similar to a virus in that it is designed to duplicate itself, but instead of hiding in existing files, a worm is a separate program that can infect other computers without human involvement. A worm often travels over the computer network, running in the background on an infected computer and using known vulnerabilities in computer software to locate and infect other connected devices.

Some examples of worms have been Melissa, Code Red, and Stuxnet.

### Trojan horses

Everyone knows the story of Troy and the wooden horse that was used to invade the city. This malware adopts the same name because it pretends to be something that it's not. Trojan horses are considered to be the most dangerous type of malware because of what they are often designed to do. They are spread by masquerading as a useful software utility that a user _wants_ to install. Because the user authorizes the install, this malware will often gain access to the user's files, including sensitive or private data. In addition, trojan horses will often install backdoors to let hackers into the computer, or _keyloggers_ to capture keystrokes such as passwords or credit cards. Unlike the other types of malware, trojan horses aren't generally designed to replicate themselves widely - they are intended specifically to control or destroy specific computers they infect.

Some examples of trojan horses are Gh0st RAT, Zeus, and Shedun (on Android).

## How does malware get installed?

There are several ways malware can get onto a computer initially.

1. **Direct install.** Most software is delivered over the Internet today. Users are conditioned to download and install software from a variety of sources. Malware can get installed either without the user's knowledge or through an authorized download that's been tampered with. This approach also applies to infected drives (such as USB keys) being inserted into a computer.

1. **Security vulnerability.** A defect or bug in running software such as a browser, or even the operating system can allow malware to get installed onto the computer. In this case, the malware exploits the security flaw to obtain administrator access, or to get infected files onto the computer.

1. **Backdoor.** Malware can also get installed through a designed opening left in the software. These *backdoors* are often placed there for testing and debugging. If it's left in place and released into production, it can be exploited to gain access to the computer or network.

## Protect against malware

There are several key strategies you can use along with Defender for Cloud to protect your computers and network from malware.

- Keep your servers up-to-date with the latest OS fixes and versions. Defender for Cloud will automatically alert you when monitored systems are unpatched.
- Install antimalware such as **Microsoft Antimalware for Azure Cloud Services and Virtual Machines** to help identify and remove viruses, spyware, and other malicious software.
- Use Firewalls to block network traffic. Defender for Cloud will identify open traffic to your VMs and servers and provide instructions, or even one-click actions, to activate built-in firewall capabilities of Azure.
- Integrate your antimalware solution with Microsoft Defender for Cloud to monitor the status of the antimalware protection.

This last step is crucial to a complete monitoring plan. Defender for Cloud highlights issues such as detected threats and insufficient protection, which make your VMs and computers vulnerable to malware threats. By using the information on endpoint protection issues, you can make a plan to address any identified issues.
