  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "What is the maximum size for a NoSQL database?"
    choices: 
    - content: "100 GB"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "A NoSQL database can grow larger than 100 GB."
    - content: "4 TB"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Typically, unsharded relational databases can grow to only 4 TB."
    - content: "Infinite"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "A NoSQL database can grow to unlimited size."
  - content: "What should be optimized when you're designing a data model for a NoSQL database?"
    choices: 
    - content: "Storage efficiency"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The cost of storage relative to compute is cheap. So optimizing for storage isn't the primary objective."
    - content: "Compute efficiency"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Compute is expensive relative to storage. So optimizing for compute by reducing the number of requests is the primary objective."
    - content: "Network efficiency"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Optimizing for network throughput isn't a primary objective when you're designing a data model."
