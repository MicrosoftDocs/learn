  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "When data is not partitioned correctly, where can hot partitions occur?"
    choices: 
    - content: "Storage"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Hot partitions can occur on both storage and throughput."
    - content: "Storage and throughput"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Hot partitions can occur on both storage and throughput, preventing your database from being able to scale."
    - content: "Throughput"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Hot partitions can occur on both storage and throughput."
  - content: "When designing for write-heavy workloads, how should writes be distributed?"
    choices: 
    - content: "Across many partition key values"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Spread requests as evenly as possible across partition key values by using a partition key with high cardinality."
    - content: "On one partition key value"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The value of the partition key should have high cardinality to spread the requests evenly across many partitions."
    - content: "Across a few partition keys values"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The value of the partition key should have high cardinality to spread the requests evenly across many partitions."
