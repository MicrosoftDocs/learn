  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "What is a good design pattern when you're modeling small lookup tables in a NoSQL database with small amounts of data?"
    choices:
    - content: "Put all entities in the same container and use a discriminator property to distinguish between them."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Storing entities in the same container is more efficient because they can all share the throughput on the container."
    - content: "Group only those entities that have the same schema into the same containers and others in different containers."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Azure Cosmos DB is schema agnostic, so you can mix entities with different schemas in the same container."
    - content: "Put each entity into its own container."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Data like this should be stored in the same container with a discriminator property to distinguish between entities."
  - content: "When you're modeling small lookup tables, using a discriminator property means adding a new property with what kind of value?"
    choices:
    - content: "An incremental value for each new document"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The discriminator value should contain the same value for each separate entity."
    - content: "A random value for each new document"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The discriminator value should contain the same value for each separate entity."
    - content: "The same value for each entity"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "When you're adding a discriminator property to the schema, give it a constant value for each entity in the container."
