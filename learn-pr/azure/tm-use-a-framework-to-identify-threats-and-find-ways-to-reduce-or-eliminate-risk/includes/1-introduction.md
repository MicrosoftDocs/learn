A threat-modeling framework helps you generate a list of potential threats and find ways to reduce or eliminate risk.

As long as you have a working knowledge of information security, the framework takes you through the major categories of threats to make sure they're tackled appropriately.

## When to use the framework

You should apply this framework to every data-flow diagram created for a new or existing system.

> [!NOTE]
> The goal is to find and fix as many issues early in the development lifecycle. The longer you wait, the greater the risk for your customers.

## What to expect

The framework takes you through six major threat categories, with countless potential threats under each one.

Using the framework, you're able to answer questions like:

- Are both sides of the communication authenticated?
- How do I know someone can't change data in transit, in use, or at rest?
- Can every action be tied to an identity?
- How do I know someone can't see data in transit, in use, or at rest?
- Are there areas in the system where resources are limited?
- How do I know someone is allowed to take this action?

In this module, you learn about each threat category and its corresponding security controls.

## Learning objectives

By the end of this module, you're able to:

- Discuss each threat category in the threat-modeling framework.
- Learn about the security controls to help reduce or eliminate risk.

## Prerequisites
