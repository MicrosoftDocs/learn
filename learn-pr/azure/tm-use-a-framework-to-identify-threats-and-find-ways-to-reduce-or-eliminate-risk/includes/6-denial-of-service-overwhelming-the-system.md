**Denial of service** occurs when an attacker causes the system to be unavailable. 

Examples include:

- Flooding the network with requests.
- Absorbing memory and CPU processes.
- Crashing data stores with an overwhelming number of requests.

## Elements and interactions at risk from denial of service

### Element

|Name|Shape|Definition|
|----|-----|----------|
|Process|![Process.](../media/process50.png)|Activity that modifies or redirects input to an output.|
|Data store|![Data Store.](../media/data-store50.png)|Permanent or temporary data storage.|
|Data-flow|![Data-Flow.](../media/data-flow50.png)|Data movement between elements|

### Interaction

|Name|Interaction|Definition|
|----|-----------|----------|
|Process -> Process|![Process to Process Unilateral Interaction.](../media/process-process-unilateral.png)|A task sends data to another task.|
|Process <-> External Entity|![Process to External Entity Interaction.](../media/process-externalentity.png)|A task sends or receives data to or from a user.|
|Process <-> Data Store|![Process to Data Store Interaction.](../media/process-datastore.png)|A task sends or receives data to or from a data store.|
|Data Flow <-> Trust Boundary|![Data-Flow to Trust Boundary Interaction.](../media/flow-trustboundary.png)|Data is transmitted from a trusted environment to someone over the internet (and vice-versa).|

## How to prevent denial of service

**Availability** ensures your system is up and running for users. Examples include:

- Using network access-control lists to control incoming and outgoing traffic.
- Using elastic resources to manage usage when it grows or shrinks.
- Monitoring the system to detect anomalies.
- Enabling operating-system flags to handle memory and CPU processes.

### Common security controls to reduce or eliminate risk

- Access control lists (ACL)
- Filtering
- Quotas
- Authorization
- High availability

> [!TIP]
> **Good question to ask:**
> Are there areas where my service is resource-limited?
