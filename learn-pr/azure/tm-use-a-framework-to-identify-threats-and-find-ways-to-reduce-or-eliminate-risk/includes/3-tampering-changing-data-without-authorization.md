**Tampering** occurs when a malicious attacker reads, modifies, deletes, or inserts data in your system without authorization. 

Examples include:

- Modifying data temporarily stored in cache, sent over-the-wire, or permanently stored in databases to compromise data integrity.
- Inserting malicious payloads into browser caches to cause erratic behavior in processes and data stores.
- Modifying memory through weak API call handling to cause crashes and disclosure of sensitive error messages.
- Redirecting data to compromised machines to take over the system.
- Tricking users into joining a network or downloading a file, which grants them traffic and device access (used in combination with spoofing).

## Elements and interactions at risk from tampering attacks

### Element

|Name|Shape|Definition|
|----|-----|----------|
|Process|![Process.](../media/process50.png)|Activity that modifies or redirects input to an output.|
|Data store|![Data store.](../media/data-store50.png)|Permanent or temporary data storage.|
|Data-flow|![Data-flow.](../media/data-flow50.png)|Data movement between elements.|

### Interaction

|Name|Interaction|Definition|
|----|-----------|----------|
|Process <-> Data store|![Process to Data Store Interaction.](../media/process-datastore.png)|A task sends or receives data to or from a data store.|
|Data-flow <-> Trust boundary|![Data-Flow to Trust Boundary Interaction.](../media/flow-trustboundary.png)|Data is transmitted from a trusted environment to someone over the internet (and vice-versa).|

## How to prevent tampering

**Integrity** prevents data from being maliciously modified. Examples include:

- Validating input to prevent the processing of malicious payloads and mishandling of unexpected behavior.
- Signing messages with digital signatures to ensure messages aren't tampered with.
- Using access-control lists to apply permissions.
- Using TLS/SSL to secure transmission.
- Creating an IPSec tunnel to secure communication between endpoints.

### Common security controls to reduce or eliminate risk

- Operating system integrity controls
- Access control lists (ACL)
- Digital signatures
- Message authentication codes

> **Good question to ask:**
> How do I know someone can't change my data in transit or at rest?
