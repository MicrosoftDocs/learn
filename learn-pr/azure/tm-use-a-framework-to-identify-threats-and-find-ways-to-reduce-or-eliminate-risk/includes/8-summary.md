A threat-model framework helps you generate a list of potential threats and find ways to reduce or eliminate risk for your system. You learned about each threat category with its corresponding security controls.

In this module, you:

- Discussed each threat category in the threat-modeling framework.
- Learned about the security controls to help reduce or eliminate risk.

> [!TIP]
> **Did you know?** There are many other frameworks you can use to accomplish different goals. Examples include using LINDDUN for privacy threats and attack trees for penetration-testing teams. Attack trees help determine how an attack can take place with an "assumed breach" mentality.
