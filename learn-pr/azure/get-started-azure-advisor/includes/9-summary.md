- **Reliability**: Such as recommending redundancy to keep your applications up and running
- **Operational Excellence**: Such as providing your service health status, which can affect your applications
- **Performance**: Such as scaling applications or upgrading resources to get better performance

You've learned through step-by-step examples how Advisor gives you *actionable* recommendations. The Advisor dashboard makes applying its recommendations quick and easy. Lastly, you've seen how you can use Advisor Score as a way to set target goals for optimizing your workloads and then track your progress over time.
