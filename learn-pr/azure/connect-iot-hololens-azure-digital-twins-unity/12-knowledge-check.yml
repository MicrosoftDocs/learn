quiz:
  questions:
  - content: "What does an Azure Resource Manager (ARM) template do?"
    choices:
    - content: "Automates Azure Service deployment."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Yes, ARM templates let you specify the Azure resources you want to deploy and the properties of those resources."
    - content: "Automates Visual Studio build validation."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "ARM templates are not part of Visual Studio or its build validation workflow."
    - content: "Automates app distribution through PowerShell." 
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Although ARM templates are executed through PowerShell or Windows Command Prompt, they don't control app distribution."
  - content: "What happens to telemetry data when a simulated alert is triggered?"
    choices:
    - content: "The simulator sends a property update to ADT, setting the Alert property to True, and begins polling ADT at a regular interval until the Alert property is set back to False."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Yes, the alert is triggered and fired until it's cleared, at which point normal telemetry data resumes."
    - content: "The simulator creates a trigger object in ADT, sets the Alert property to Sent, and immediately resumes sending telemetry data without waiting for a response."
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: "Instead of creating a trigger object, the simulator sends a property update to ADT and sets the Alert property to True. Then, the simulator polls ADT until the Alert is set back to False."
    - content: "The simulator stops running the app on the mixed reality device until ADT sends back an Alert trigger confirmation, at which point telemetry data resumes."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Instead of stopping the app, the simulator sends a property update to ADT and sets the Alert property to True. Then, the simulator polls ADT until the Alert is set back to False."  
  - content: "What approach is the most efficient means to create assets in Unity that connect to ADT?"
    choices:
    - content: "Create one asset in the Scene and copy-paste it so that all parameters are transferred to the copy."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Although this can be a quick approach to duplicate assets, it's still a manual approach and requires manual manipulation after to copy-paste."
    - content: "Develop a ScriptableObject to create assets at runtime based on a core Prefab"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "ScriptableObjects are the quickest way to create many assets, repeatedly.  ScriptableObjects use scripts to create assets based on a core Prefab and can be created and configured in mass, at runtime."
    - content: "Drag and drop Prefab assets in the Scene" 
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This is a quick way to add assets to a Unity Scene, each will require manual configuration after dropping into the scene"
  - content: "Which of the following real-time content use cases is the Azure SignalR service NOT a good fit for?"
    choices:
    - content: "High-frequency data updates"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "High-frequency data updates for gaming, voting, polling, and auctioning are actually great use cases for Azure SignalR."
    - content: "IoT and connected devices"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "IoT and connected devices for real-time IoT metrics, remote control, real-time status, and location tracking are fantastic use cases for Azure SignalR."
    - content: "Local device data storage"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Azure SignalR is ideal for pushing real-time content updates to connected clients, not storing locally cached data on devices."
