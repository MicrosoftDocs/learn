In this module, you'll learn about the process of deploying and configuring Azure SQL. Through the exercises, you will deploy and configure Azure SQL Database, but you will see comparisons to both Azure SQL Managed Instanced and SQL Server. In addition to the Azure portal, you'll leverage SSMS, Azure Data Studio (including SQL and PowerShell Notebooks), and the Azure CLI.

Note that this is the second module in the Azure SQL Fundamentals learning path. It is recommended to complete the Azure SQL introduction module before continuing here TODO ADD REFERENCE 

Throughout the exercises, it's important to also read the accompanying text to the steps, but know that you can always come back to this page to review what you did at a later time.  

In this module, the following topics will be discussed:  
* Pre-deployment planning  
* Deploy and verify  
* Configure  
* Load data  

### Prerequisites for exercises  

If you intend to complete the exercises (recommended), a sandbox environment is provided for Azure resources. However, you do need to do a few things on your local machine in order to complete the exercises:  

* Use a Windows machine or VM (SSMS is only available on Windows)  
* Download and install [the latest version of SSMS](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms?view=sql-server-ver15)
* Download and install [the latest version on Azure Data Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/azure-data-studio/download-azure-data-studio?view=sql-server-ver15)
* Download the zip file which includes some of the lab files and the **ostress** tool. Extract the contents of the zip file to something similar to `C:\users\[YourUsername]\` so you can access it easily in the exercises.  
* TODO TBD MAY NEED TO ADD OSTRESS TO PATH   

If you cannot complete the prerequisites, you can still go through the module and see demos of the exercises.
