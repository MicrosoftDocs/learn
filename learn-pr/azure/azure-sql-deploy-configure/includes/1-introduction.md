In this module, you learn about the process of deploying and configuring Azure SQL products. Through hands-on exercises, you deploy and configure Azure SQL Database. You also see comparisons to both Azure SQL Managed Instance and SQL Server. In addition to the Azure portal, you work with SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS), and the Azure CLI.

This module is the second module in the learning path about Azure SQL fundamentals. We recommend that you complete [the introductory module](/training/modules/azure-sql-intro/) before you continue.

## Learning objectives

At the end of this module, you should be able to:  

* Plan for an Azure SQL deployment.
* Deploy and verify Azure SQL Database by using common tools and interfaces.
* Configure Azure SQL Database after deployment.
* Load data into Azure SQL.

## Prerequisites

* Experience working with, maintaining, and developing with SQL Server
* Experience with Azure, such as deploying and managing resources
* An active Azure subscription

You need to do a few things on your local machine in order to complete the exercises:  

* Make sure that the machine or virtual machine is running Windows. SSMS is available only on Windows.  
* Download and install [the latest version of SSMS](/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms?azure-portal=true).


If you can't complete the prerequisites, you can still go through the module and see demos of the exercises.
