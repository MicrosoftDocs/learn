    questions:
    - content: "Which Azure SQL deployment options support natively restoring a database?"
      choices:
      - content: "SQL Server on an Azure VM"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Yes, this choice is just SQL Server. But are there other options?"
      - content: "Azure SQL Managed Instance"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Azure SQL Managed Instance does support native restore (from a URL). But are there other options?"
      - content: "Azure SQL Database"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "This capability isn't currently supported in Azure SQL Database."
      - content: "SQL Server on an Azure VM and Azure SQL Managed Instance"
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "In an Azure VM, it's just SQL Server, so it's supported. In Azure SQL Managed Instance, native restore from a URL is supported."
    - content: "What isn't an example of how you can more efficiently load data into Azure SQL Database and Azure SQL Managed Instance?"
      choices:
      - content: "Use clustered columnstore indexes"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Loading into a clustered columnstore index might help in avoiding transaction log limits, depending on your scenario."
      - content: "Use batching with appropriately sized batches"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Loading in batches can help decrease network latency, but they need to be sized appropriately so they don't trigger log governance limits."
      - content: "Use simple recovery mode"
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "This capability isn't currently supported in Azure SQL Database or Azure SQL Managed Instance. Full recovery mode is required to meet the SLA."
      - content: "All of the above will help in Azure SQL Database and Azure SQL Managed Instance"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "One of the options isn't supported in Azure SQL Database or Azure SQL Managed Instance."
