## Summary

This module has shown you how to create an Azure Cosmos DB account that you can use for real world scenarios like online retail apps. By creating a database with a smart partition key, you'll be able to scale horizontally as your need for data storage grows. You've also learned about request unit needs for your application, and how to set them during account creation so that you can scale up your throughput later, when user demand increases.

## Clean up

If you plan to continue working on the modules in this learning path, skip the clean up process, else use the following steps to delete your resources to avoid incurring charges for use of the service.:

1. In the Azure portal, select **Resource groups** on the far left, and then select the resource group you created.
