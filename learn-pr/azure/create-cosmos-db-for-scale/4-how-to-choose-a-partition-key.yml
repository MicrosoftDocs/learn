  - content: 'An organization is planning to use Azure Cosmos DB to store vehicle telemetry data generated from millions of vehicles every second. What selection of Partition Key will optimize storage distribution?'
    choices:
    - content: 'Vehicle Model'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Most auto manufactures only have a couple dozen models. This is potentially the least granular option, will create a fixed number of logical partitions, and may not distribute data evenly across all physical partitions.
    - content: 'Current Month'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Auto manufacturers have transactions occurring throughout the year. This will create a more balanced distribution of storage across partition key values.
