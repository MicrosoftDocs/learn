  title: Knowledge check
  questions:
  - content: Which of the following is **not** a key benefit of Azure Orbital Ground Station?
    choices:
    - content: Azure Orbital Ground Station allows satellite operators to move away from the traditional CAPEX (capital expense) model and adopt an OPEX (operating expense) model. So satellite operators only pay for what they use when downlinking data from satellites to the Microsoft ground station network and storing earth observation data in Azure.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "**Incorrect**: The OPEX model is a key benefit of AO Ground Station."
    - content: Microsoft has a partner-centric approach. When satellite operators use Azure Orbital Ground Station, they gain access to a global network of ground stations owned by Microsoft and industry leaders KSAT, USEI, and Viasat RTE. In addition to ground station partners, there's a broader community of Microsoft space partners bringing their expertise and solutions to Azure Space.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "**Incorrect**: The partnership approach is a key benefit of AO Ground Station."
    - content: Azure Orbital Ground Station allows satellite operators to use powerful AI and ML tools in Azure to apply to earth observation data for data-driven decision making.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "**Incorrect**: The AI and ML models on Azure are key benefits of AO Ground Station."
    - content: Microsoft and their coalition of space partners incubate possible applications for earth observation data across a wide range of non-space industries. From agriculture to disaster relief, Microsoft is working to fund new, transformative ventures.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "**Correct**: While AO Ground Station makes a wide variety of use cases possible, Microsoft and the Azure Space Community aren't incubating or funding these applications."
  - content: What tools would a satellite operator use to downlink data then store and process it in Azure?
    choices:
    - content: Microsoft’s satellite, the satellite operator’s data-processing tools, the satellite operator’s ground station network, Microsoft’s Azure Orbital portal
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "**Incorrect**: Satellite operators use their own satellites and Microsoft provides access to Azure Orbital’s ground station network."
    - content: The satellite operator’s satellite, the satellite operator’s data-processing tools, Microsoft’s ground station network, Microsoft’s Azure Orbital portal
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "**Correct**: Satellite operators bring their own constellations and data-processing tools. Microsoft provides the ground station infrastructure and portal for downlinking and storing data."
    - content: The satellite operator’s satellite, the satellite operator’s data-processing tools, the satellite operator’s ground station network, Microsoft’s Azure Orbital portal
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "**Incorrect**: Microsoft provides the global ground station network, not the satellite operator."
    - content: The satellite operator’s satellite, Microsoft’s data-processing tools, Microsoft’s ground station network, Microsoft’s Azure Orbital portal
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "**Incorrect**: Every satellite operator has unique data-processing tools; therefore, Microsoft doesn't provide the processing tools."
  - content: What is the best definition for processing data?
    choices:
    - content: Moving data from the ground station to the cloud
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "**Incorrect**: Processing data has to do with making the data analysis-ready, not with where it's located."
    - content: Gaining insights from space data to apply to a specific use case
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "**Incorrect**: Data must be processed before insights can be gained for specific applications."
    - content: Data with space-time grid scales
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "**Incorrect**: This is the definition for Level 3 data, not for processing data."
    - content: Transforming data from unusable, demodulated data into an analysis-ready data set
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "**Correct**: The above accurately describes processing data."
  - content: What industries can unlock insights from earth observation data once it has been processed and analyzed?
    choices:
    - content: Satellite operators
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect: Satellite operators enable other industries to unlock insights from space data, but they themselves don't take an active role in applying the earth observation data."
    - content: A wide range of industries—including but not limited to agriculture, insurance agencies, research institutions, emergency response teams, and more
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct: There are many applications across space and non-space industries alike for the use of space data."
    - content: Space startups
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect: Space startups is a broad term that encompasses companies working on a wide range of space-related offerings. Some work in earth data analysis, but many don't."
