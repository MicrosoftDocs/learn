Threat modeling takes your data-flow diagram and applies a framework to help find threats and ways to reduce or eliminate risk. It helps meet security goals early in the development lifecycle and secures your systems, applications, networks, and services.

Some tools help you create a data-flow diagram, while others also help with the threat-generation exercise. Your level of expertise with threat modeling may dictate which tool fits best. We'll look at two tools in the next couple units.

## Microsoft Threat Modeling Tool

The Microsoft Threat Modeling Tool enables you to create data-flow diagrams. It allows anyone to communicate about the security design of their systems, analyze those designs for potential security issues, and suggest and manage mitigations for security issues.

We look at the different sections, stencils, and elements to see how the different properties work together. Then we analyze risk-reduction strategies to specify how threat generation works.

## Visio

Our other recommended tool is Visio. It gives you a clean canvas to create data-flow diagrams. With the Visio desktop and web applications, you can view, edit, and share Visio diagrams as well. You can also save them in Sharepoint or OneDrive for Business to share with others.

We talk about some of the basic functionality of Visio as well as pros and cons associated with the tool.
