Microsoft Visio is recognized for its robust set of features to help anyone create quality flowcharts and data-flow diagrams.

## Pros

Visio provides drag-and-drop functionality and the ability to annotate diagrams. Both are helpful when creating a diagram for your system.

## Cons

The application doesn't offer automated threat-modeling capabilities. As a result, there's no threat-generation engine to help engineers brainstorm threats and risk-reduction strategies.

> [!NOTE]
> If you use Visio, you'll be responsible for threat modeling each element and interaction manually.
