Microsoft Visio is recognized for its robust set of features to help anyone create quality flowcharts and data-flow diagrams. Visio tools help you visualize how an application or systems is organized towards threat modeling.

You can leverage to create flowcharts, basic network diagrams, Venn diagrams, block diagrams, and busines matrices. All while being able to start quickly and in a collaborative manner. Let's look at some other pros to using Visio as well as review any cons.

## Pros

Visio provides drag-and-drop functionality and the ability to annotate diagrams. Both are helpful when creating a diagram for your system.

In addition, the tool is accessible for a wide variety of users. The intuitive interface and ease of use takes minimal time to learn and setup. It shares a familiar experience to other Microsoft 365 apps.

It also includes templates for diagrams and flowcharts to help you start quickly. This alongside real-time collaboration, commenting, and sharing with the Visio web app or Visio app in Micorosoft Teams makes it a valuable tool across your organization towards your threat modeling goals.

## Cons

The application doesn't offer automated threat-modeling capabilities. As a result, there's no threat-generation engine to help engineers brainstorm threats and risk-reduction strategies.

Also, when you use Visio you'll be responsible for threat modeling each element and interaction manually.
