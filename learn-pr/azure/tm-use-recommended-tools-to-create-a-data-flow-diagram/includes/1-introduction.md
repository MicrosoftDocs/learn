A data-flow diagram is a graphical representation of how your system works. It includes all data stores, processes, external entities, trust boundaries, and data-flows. Using these diagrams help all users in your organization collaborate to enhance your threat modeling work.

## Creating a data-flow diagram

You can use any canvas, physical or virtual, to create a data-flow diagram. However, you do need a working knowledge of threat modeling to analyze it properly.

Some applications provide you with the tools to create a data-flow diagram alongside a threat-generation engine and risk-reduction strategies. Other tools only provide you with the ability to create a data-flow diagram.

The goal of this learning path is to teach you the fundamentals of threat modeling allowing you to threat model on any canvas. We also recommend a couple tools along the way to assist.
