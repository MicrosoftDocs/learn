A data-flow diagram is a graphical representation of how your system works. It includes all data stores, processes, external entities, trust boundaries, and data-flows.

## How to create a data-flow diagram

You can use any canvas, physical or virtual, to create a data-flow diagram. However, you do need a working knowledge of threat modeling to analyze it properly.

Some applications provide you with the tools create a data-flow diagram with a threat-generation engine and risk-reduction strategies. Other tools only provide you with the ability to create a data-flow diagram.

## Goals

The goal of this learning path is to teach you the fundamentals of threat modeling for you to threat model anywhere, on any canvas.

To help you get there, we recommend a few tools along the way.
