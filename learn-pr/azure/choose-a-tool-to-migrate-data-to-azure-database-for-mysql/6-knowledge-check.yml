quiz:
  questions:
  - content: "What is an online migration?"
    choices:
    - content: "An in-place major version migration that keeps the database online."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "A database has to restart to update major versions. An online migration refers to the entire application staying online."
    - content: "A server-to-server data migration that keeps the application online."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct, an online migration refers to application downtime."
    - content: "A server-to-server migration using an online connection."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Transferring data with an online connection is part of an online migration, but not the full story. Live connections on write-frozen databases can also be used for bulk transfer for an offline migration."
  - content: "You’re migrating a MySQL database running on a VM to an Azure Database for MySQL flexible server. The application can tolerate about an hour, but not several hours, of downtime. A full backup (several years of data) takes about 4 hours to restore. What’s the best option?"
    choices:
    - content: "An online migration."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "While an online migration would remove the downtime, its extra complexity when the application can tolerate about an hour of downtime."
    - content: "An offline migration using a full snapshot."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "A full snapshot would take about 4 hours to restore. The application would have to be online during this process (at least), which exceeds the one hour downtime target."
    - content: "An offline migration using a full snapshot and an incremental snapshot."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "This is the best choice. The four hour transfer can occur first. Then, the application can go down to capture & migrate the smaller increment, to fit within the hour of downtime."
  - content: "You want to migrate your on-premises MySQL database to Azure because it exhausts processing and storage resources regularly. Near-zero downtime is preferable. Which of these approaches should you consider?"
    choices:
    - content: "Restore the database from a snapshot and use the binary log to synchronize changes that occurred since the snapshot was taken."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "While this is a way to eliminate downtime, it's manual and error-prone compared to automated approaches like Azure Database Migration Service."
    - content: "Use mydumper and myloader to create and restore data."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Even though these tools are fast, they'll still require downtime to migrate data once the application is frozen."
    - content: "Use Azure Migrate and Azure Database Migration Service to automate migration and minimize downtime."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Azure DMS automates the migration process, and can perform an online migration, or a near-zero downtime offline migration."
  - content: "You want to test application changes against realistic data. Which option should you pick?"
    choices:
    - content: "Restore database backups into development environments."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Unless necessary, this poses a security risk as it places full customer data into nonproduction environments."
    - content: "Use a tool like mysqldump to create controlled test scenarios."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "A test scenario should contain PERSONAL DATA-safe customer data, if any customer data at all. The mysqldump allows you to build selective test scenarios."
    - content: "Use Azure Database for MySQL Import CLI to create test data."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This isn't one of the Import CLI's features."
  - content: "You want to migrate a high-availability flexible server from one region to another. Some downtime is acceptable. Which is the simplest solution?"
    choices:
    - content: "Use mydumper and myloader to migrate two parallel instances, then enable replication."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "While highly available databases do have two instances, the high availability comes from other mechanisms such as managed failover (not just replication)."
    - content: "Use MySQL Workbench to set up two target databases and perform a migration, then enable replication."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "While highly available databases do have two instances, the high availability comes from other mechanisms such as managed failover (not just replication)."
    - content: "Use Percona XtraBackup and Azure Database for MySQL Import CLI to create the target server, and then enable HA."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "This is a simple way to migrate the data, and ensure managed high-availability in the flexible server."
