<!-- 1. Topic sentence(s) --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Goal: briefly summarize the key skill this unit will teach

    Heading: do not add an H1 or H2 title here, an auto-generated H1 will appear above this content

    Example: "Organizations often have multiple storage accounts to let them implement different sets of requirements."

TODO: add your topic sentences(s)

<!-- 2. Scenario sub-task --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Goal: Describe the part of the scenario that will be solved by the content in this unit

    Heading: none, combine this with the topic sentence into a single paragraph

    Example: "In the shoe-company scenario, we will use a Twitter trigger to launch our app when tweets containing our product name are available."
-->
TODO: add your scenario sub-task

<!-- 3. Prose table-of-contents --------------------------------------------------------------------

    Goal: State concisely what's covered in this unit

    Heading: none, combine this with the topic sentence into a single paragraph

    Example: "Here, you will learn the policy factors that are controlled by a storage account so you can decide how many accounts you need."
-->
TODO: write your prose table-of-contents

<!-- 4. Image (highly recommended) ----------------------------------------------------------------

    Goal: Add a visual like an image, table, list, etc. that supports the topic sentence. Ideally, you'll provide an image that illustrates the customer problem the unit will solve; it can use the scenario to do this or stay generic (i.e. not address the scenario).
-->
TODO: add a visual

<!-- 5. Chunked content-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Goal: Provide all the information the learner needs to perform this sub-task.

    Structure: Break the content into 'chunks' where each chunk has three things:
        1. An H2 or H3 heading describing the goal of the chunk
        2. 1-3 paragraphs of text
        3. A visual like an image, table, or list
