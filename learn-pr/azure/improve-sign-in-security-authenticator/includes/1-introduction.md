You can improve sign-in security by helping users set up Microsoft Authenticator whenever they sign in.

## Example scenario

You monitor security compliance for a manufacturer that uses Microsoft 365. In response to recent supply-chain attacks, senior leadership wants to strengthen sign-in security for the company.

The company already requires MFA, but many remote employees use either a voice call or an SMS code for additional authentication after they sign in with their username and password. With budgets already set for this year, leadership wants a low-cost solution that helps their remote employees switch to more secure authentication and gradually move to passwordless sign-in.

You need to research the security differences among available authentication options and determine a way to help remote employees switch. Then, you want to prepare your Microsoft 365 environment and validate the experience for users.

## What will we be doing?

You'll review the relative security strength of different authentication methods and prepare your environment by creating a policy for remote employees to set up Microsoft Authenticator. Then, you'll create a test user and walk through the setup process on a phone.

## What is the main goal?

By the end of this module, you'll be able to explain why Microsoft Authenticator provides better security than authentication methods like SMS or voice call. You'll also enable users to register Microsoft Authenticator when they sign in and confirm it's their default sign-in method.
