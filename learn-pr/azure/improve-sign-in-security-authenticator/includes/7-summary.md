To improve sign-in security, you needed to roll out a low-cost sign-in strategy to help users switch from signing in with less secure methods, like voice calls or SMS, to a more secure method. 

You chose to create a registration campaign to help users set up Microsoft Authenticator, a free app, and use it as their default method for sign-in. The registration campaign helps improve the company's security posture in many ways:

- Remote employees can easily set up Microsoft Authenticator after they perform MFA.
- Remote employees are nudged to set up Microsoft Authenticator every time they sign in.
- Sign-ins using less secure methods are reduced.
- Remote employees can gradually move to passwordless authentication.

Usernames and passwords should be supplemented with modern authentication and security features as part of multifactor authentication. Improving the sign-in process with better authentication methods like Microsoft Authenticator is one of the most effective ways for an organization to improve its overall security posture. Users who sign in with less secure methods (like SMS and voice call) create extra risk for your company.  

You helped your company take an important step to prevent security breaches from compromised credentials. You increased the number of users who sign in using Microsoft Authenticator push notifications. With more users signing in with Microsoft Authenticator, your company is in a better position to gradually move to passwordless authentication.
