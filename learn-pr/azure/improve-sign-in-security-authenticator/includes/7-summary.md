<!-- 1. Restate the scenario problem --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Goal: Summarize the challenge(s) posed in the introduction scenario; be brief (1-2 sentences)

    Heading: none

    Example: "You are writing the instruction manual for a new model fire extinguisher. The instructions must be quickly read and understood by a wide variety of people."

-->
To improve sign-in security, you needed to roll out a low-cost sign-in strategy to help users switch from signing in with less secure methods like Voice calls or SMS to a more secure method. 


<!-- 2. Show how you solved the scenario problem(s)---------------------------------------------------

    Goal: Describe how you used the product to solve the problem(s) posed in the introduction scenario

    Heading: none; depending on length, you can put this in a separate paragraph or combine this with the previous section into a single paragraph

    Recommended: format this as lead-in sentence(s) followed by a list

    Example: "You did some research and found that Plain English is a good writing style for safety-critical communications. You applied several Plain English techniques to your instructions:
        * Removed unnecessary words, which made your sentences easier to read even in a stressful situation like a fire.
        * Made sure all sentences used the active voice, which made your content more direct.
        * Replaced fire-industry jargon with everyday words, which made the instructions accessible to a wider audience.
        * Replaced a comma-delimited list with a bulleted list, which made the steps to activate the fire extinguisher easier to follow."
 -->
You chose to create a registration campaign to help users set up Microsoft Authenticator, a free app, and use it as their default method for sign-in. The registration campaign helps improve the company's security posture in many ways:

- Remote employees can easily set up Microsoft Authenticator after they perform MFA.
- Remote employees are nudged to set up Microsoft Authenticator every time they sign in. 
- Sign-ins using less secure methods are reduced.
- Remote employees can gradually move to passwordless authentication. 

<!-- 3. Describe the experience without the product ---------------------------------------------------

    Goal: Describe what would be required to solve the problem without using the product; be brief (1-2 sentences)

    Heading: none; typically this will be a new paragraph

    Example: "Fire extinguishers are critical safety equipment for both homes and businesses. Despite their importance, many customers don't read the instructions ahead of time. Confusing instructions could mean customers don't use the extinguisher correctly when they're needed. This can result in loss of property or life."

 -->
Password and username should be supplemented with modern authentication and security features as part of multifactor authentication. Improving the sign-in process with better authentication methods like Microsoft Authenticator is one of the most effective ways for an organization to improve its overall security posture. Users who sign in with less secure methods like SMS and voice call create extra risk for your company.  


<!-- 4. Describe the business impact ----------------------------------------------------

    Goal: explain the business impact of using the product to solve the problem

    Heading: none; depending on length, you can put this in a separate paragraph or combine this with the previous section into a single paragraph

    Example: "The test for effective instructions is whether customers can use your extinguishers correctly during an emergency. Users that fail might blame the instructions or the product. In either case, it's not good for business. On the other hand, successful customers are likely to share their stories and become advocates for your product."
 -->
You helped your company take an important step to prevent security breaches from compromised credentials. You increased the number of users who sign in using Microsoft Authenticator push notifications. With more users signing in with Microsoft Authenticator, your company is in a better position to gradually move to passwordless authentication. 

<!-- 5. References (optional) ----------------------------------------------------

    Goal: Provide a few recommendations for further study via a bulleted list of links. This is optional and intended to be used sparingly.        - use the target page title as the text for your link
        - do not include other text such as a description
        - prefer other first-party sites like Docs reference pages
        - link to third-party sites only when they are trusted and authoritative
        - do not link to other Learn content ("next steps" recommendations are generated automatically)
        - avoid linking to opinion sites such as blog posts

    Heading: "## References"

    Example:
        "## References
