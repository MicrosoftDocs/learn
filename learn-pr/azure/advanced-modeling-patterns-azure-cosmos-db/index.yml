title: Optimize databases by using advanced modeling patterns for Azure Cosmos DB  
summary: Identify strategies for managing relationships between data entities, such as customers and sales data. Improve data-model performance and scaling by pre-aggregating and denormalizing your data. Use change feed to maintain the referential integrity of your data.
abstract: | 
  By the end of this module, you'll be able to: 
    - Manage relationships between data entities by using advanced modeling and partitioning strategies.
    - Maintain the referential integrity of your data by using change feed.
    - Implement pre-aggregating and denormalizing data strategies to improve data-model performance and scaling.
prerequisites: | 
  - Familiarity with Azure Cosmos DB concepts such as databases, containers, documents, and throughput (request units per second [RU/s]).
  - Familiarity with navigating Azure Cosmos DB resources and data by using Data Explorer in the Azure portal, running queries, and viewing query stats in results.
  - Familiarity with basic modeling and partitioning strategies, such as embedding or referencing data in entities.
  - Familiarity with Azure Cosmos DB .NET SDK v3.
  - Familiarity with Azure Cosmos DB change feed.
