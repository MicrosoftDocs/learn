quiz:
  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: When should you use AzCopy instead of the Azure Import/Export service?
    choices:
    - content: To import or export small amounts of data from Azure Storage when network latency isn't an issue.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Use AzCopy to transfer small to moderate amounts of data online across the network.
    - content:  To import or export large amounts of data.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Use Azure Import/Export to export large amounts of data offline. For import, use Azure Import/Export in regions where Azure Data Box devices aren't supported.
    - content: To transfer data from Azure Storage to on-premises storage while you're offline.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: AzCopy requires an active connection to your storage account in Azure. To do an offline transfer, use the Import/Export service or Data Box family.
  - content: When should you use Azure Import/Export service instead of the Data Box Family?
    choices:
    - content: To transfer data using an online connection.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: The Import/Export service is an offline solution. You can transfer data over a network connection using Azure Stack Edge or Data Box Gateway.
    - content: To use a Microsoft-supplied device instead of disks that you supply.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Data Box family uses Microsoft-supplied devices to transfer data from your on-premises location to Azure Storage. 
    - content: You're in a region where Data Box family isn't supported.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Data Box family is the recommended solution for handling very large import or export jobs when the organization is located in a region where it's supported.
