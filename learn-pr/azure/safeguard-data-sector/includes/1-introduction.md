To support governments in their responsibilities to maintain strong data protection requirements, Microsoft Azure provides technologies to safeguard both unclassified and classified workloads in the public multi-tenant cloud. Data is protected at rest, in transit, and in use, through a combination of residency requirements and encryption standards. Strict policies reduce the risk of unauthorized access while allowing public sector customers flexibility to customize services for additional protection.
