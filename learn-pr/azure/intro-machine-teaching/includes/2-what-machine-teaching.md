Autonomous systems incorporate expert knowledge into the design of Autonomous AI. The mechanism to include human knowledge into AI systems is called Machine Teaching.

Teaching machines is like teaching people, i.e., human experts pass on their knowledge and experience to guide the machine’s acquisition of intelligence. Domain experts can teach machines without needing to be experts in AI or data science themselves. Through machine teaching, autonomous systems can act as a decision-support system for human operators or directly control an industrial process.

In combination with simulation, you can use Machine Teaching to acquire experience for autonomous systems. The simulation enables autonomous systems to rapidly acquire experience through parallel exploration of the simulated industrial environment through a Sense > Plan > Act loop. Machine Teaching helps guide the exploration of the simulated environment towards an even quicker arrival to effective control policies.  Then, when the system is trained sufficiently, you can deploy it to a physical device.

Consider the example of training a robotic arm to grasp objects and then stack them up on top of each other. Based on the expertise of the subject matter expert, you can break down the problem into several smaller problems such as: reach out to the object, orienting the hand to be able to grasp the object, grasping the object, moving closer to the destination, and finally stacking current object on top of the last one placed.

By using expert domain knowledge, we break down the problem to achieve the final goal.

## Differences between Machine Teaching and Machine Learning

In Machine Teaching, you divide the learning task into subtasks. Each subtask is learned separately and then combined to be executed in the right moment or scenario. In contrast, in Machine Learning, you expose the algorithm to lots of data and expect it to learn associations or find patterns on its own. For many of the most common applications of AI technologies today, such as simple text or image recognition, this approach is effective. However, for complex systems in dynamic environments, this standard approach to Machine Learning isn't enough.

## Benefits of Machine Teaching

Here are the main benefits of Machine Teaching:

- Capture (or store) the knowledge of the subject matter expert that took decades to learn and is the highest value asset of our customers.
- Outperform existing methods of control or optimization with huge business value.
- End-to-end solution, integrated into the current operation process.
- Explainable and interpretable during execution. The explanation comes from the orchestration of the different skills.
