Microsoft Purview is a unified data governance service that helps you manage and govern your on-premises, multicloud, and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) data. 

## Module scenario

Suppose you work as a data analyst for a financial institution that needs to analyze, process, and govern a large amount of data stored in different sources. Your organization uses cloud optimization, storing significant amounts of data in Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud solutions. However, because of legal regulations, a large amount of data remains in on-premises datacenters. Additionally, your company must follow compliance requirements that require a complete understanding of your organization’s data estate.

You spend considerable time manually annotating, cataloging, and finding trusted sources because you don’t have an end-to-end data lineage across your infrastructure. This affects your data consumers, who must spend time identifying the root cause of problems created by upstream data pipelines that other teams own. Your chief data officer (CDO) is struggling to map and control sensitive data, such as personal data, that is stored in multiple data sources.


Your CDO plans to enable a central location in which to register data sources to help improve data security and business processes. You must evaluate whether Microsoft Purview can help you enable a unified data-governance service, including data stored on-premises and in multiple cloud-storage solutions. You must also create an enterprise data catalog so the users who manage the data can easily discover and
understand the data sources.

Your organization can use Microsoft Purview to discover your entire data estate. Using Microsoft Purview as a central location, your organization can assess your data, including identifying its source and its data-mining value. Additionally, your CDO can use this overview of your organization’s data to assess whether it can be trusted, its storage location and sensitivity, and the risks associated with storing customer content.


## What will we be doing?

In this module, you’ll get a high-level overview about how to use Microsoft Purview to govern data stored in an on-premises SQL Server database, on Azure virtual machines (VMs), and in Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS). You’ll learn how Microsoft Purview can help you:

- Identify prerequisites.

- Set up network connections and security requirements correctly.

- Configure required credentials.

- Register data sources.

- Create scan rule sets.

- Set up scans for data sources.

- Retrieve insights through reports.

- Categorize classifications and classifications rules.

## What’s the main goal?

By the end of this module, you’ll be able to explain the process of using Microsoft Purview to connect to different data sources and list the steps to manage your enterprise data environment.
