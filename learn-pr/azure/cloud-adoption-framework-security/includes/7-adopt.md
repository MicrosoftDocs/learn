This unit describes areas of security optimization to consider as you move through the [Adopt methodology](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/secure/adopt/) phase of your journey.

:::image type="content" source="../media/secure-adopt.svg" alt-text="Diagram that shows the Adopt phase of the Secure methodology." lightbox="../media/secure-adopt.svg" border="false":::

When you implement your cloud estate and migrate workloads, establish robust security mechanisms from the start to avoid gaps later. Prioritize security during the Adopt phase to ensure consistent workloads. To prepare IT teams for cloud operations, establish well-designed policies and procedures.

The Adopt methodology includes the [Migrate](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/migrate/), [Modernize](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/modernize/), [Innovate](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/innovate/), and [Relocate](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/relocate/) scenarios. Consider the recommendations in this unit to help establish a secure foundation for your cloud estate.

## Modernize your security posture

To [modernize your security posture](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/secure/adopt#security-posture-modernization-adoption) during the Adopt phase, consider the following recommendations:

- **Define security baselines** that include availability requirements to establish a clear foundation. Use tools to analyze environments and reduce human error.

- **Embrace automation** for routine tasks to improve consistency and reduce errors. Automate failover, recovery, infrastructure deployments, software development, testing, monitoring, alerting, and scaling.

- **Implement Zero Trust access and authorization controls.** Use role-based access control (RBAC) and multifactor authentication (MFA) to help prevent unauthorized access and ensure service availability.

## Incorporate ACM methodologies

Effective [adoption and change management (ACM) methodologies](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/secure/adopt#change-management-institutionalization) are crucial for implementing access controls. Key methodologies include:

- **[The Prosci ADKAR Model](https://www.prosci.com/methodology/adkar):** This model focuses on Awareness, Desire, Knowledge, Ability, and Reinforcement. Address each element to ensure that employees understand and support access controls.

- **[The Kotter's 8-Step Change Model](https://www.kotterinc.com/methodology/8-steps/):** This model outlines steps for change, including creating urgency, forming a coalition, developing a vision, and anchoring new approaches into the culture.

- **[The Lewin's Change Management Model](https://whatfix.com/blog/lewins-change-model/):** This model consists of three stages: Unfreeze (prepare for change), Change (implement new processes), and Refreeze (solidify new practices).

- **[The Microsoft 365 Adoption Framework](https://adoption.microsoft.com/files/assets/M365AdoptionGuide.pdf):** This framework provides a structured approach that includes success criteria, stakeholder engagement, and support to help ensure effective adoption.
