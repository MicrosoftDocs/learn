Security is a complex discipline that affects all aspects of your cloud and technology environments. Attackers can exploit weaknesses in people, processes, and technologies. Implement a coordinated approach across business, technology, and security teams. Each [team](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/secure/teams-roles) should contribute to security efforts and collaborate effectively.

This Secure methodology guidance is one component of a larger holistic set of Microsoft security guidance that you can use to help teams understand and perform their security responsibilities. The complete set includes the following guidance:

- [The Secure methodology in the Cloud Adoption Framework ](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/secure/overview) provides security guidance for teams that manage the technology infrastructure that supports Azure-hosted workload development and operations.

- [The Azure Well-Architected Framework](/azure/well-architected/security/) provides security best practices for application development and DevOps and DevSecOps processes.

- [The Microsoft Cloud Security Benchmark](/security/benchmark/azure/) provides best practices for stakeholders. It includes security baselines that describe the available security features and recommended optimal configurations for Azure services.
- [Zero Trust guidance](/security/zero-trust/) provides guidance for security teams. It describes how to implement technical capabilities that support a Zero Trust modernization initiative.

## Modernize your security posture

Enhance your security posture through the [Microsoft Zero Trust adoption framework](/security/zero-trust/adopt/zero-trust-adoption-overview). This framework provides a detailed, step-by-step approach to modernize your security posture. Use the Zero Trust adoption framework to enhance the Secure methodology recommendations.

## Manage incident preparation and response

Incident preparation and response are essential for a strong security posture. Well-designed preparation mechanisms enable quicker threat detection and minimize the blast radius of incidents. Well-structured response mechanisms help ensure efficient recovery and continuous improvement.

## Incorporate the CIA Triad

The CIA Triad represents three core principles in information security:

- **Confidentiality** protects sensitive information with encryption and access controls.
- **Integrity** maintains data accuracy and completeness. It protects data from unauthorized alterations.
- **Availability** helps ensure continuous access to information and resources for authorized users.

Adopt the CIA Triad to help enforce reliability and security in your operations and technology through well-defined, strictly followed, and proven practices.

## Sustain your security posture

Cyber threats continuously evolve, so continuous improvement helps maintain a robust security posture in the cloud. Use the guidance in this module to identify opportunities for ongoing enhancements.

Integrate security into every phase of your cloud adoption journey, collaborate effectively across teams, and continuously improve your security posture to protect against evolving threats.
