  Organizations moving to the cloud often find they need to modernize security practices and tooling to keep up with continuous changes in cloud platforms, business requirements, and security threats.  
  
  The Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework for Azure provides guidance for this security modernization journey by providing clarity on processes, best practices, models, and experiences. This guidance is based on [Zero Trust](https://aka.ms/zerotrust) principles and the lessons learned and real-world experiences of Microsoft's own security work. It's also based on work with organizations like the National Institute of Standards and Technology, the Open Group, and the [Center for Internet Security](https://www.cisecurity.org/).
