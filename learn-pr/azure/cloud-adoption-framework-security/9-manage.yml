 title: Check your knowledge
 questions:
 - content: Which principle should you adopt to help modernize your observability platform?
   choices:
   - content: Trust by default
     isCorrect: false
     explanation: Incorrect. Trust by default assumes that all activities are trusted unless proven otherwise, which isn't suitable for modern security practices.
   - content: Trust by exception
     isCorrect: true
     explanation: Correct. Trust by exception implies that you use identity and access monitoring to detect anomalous behavior in real-time, which is essential for modern observability.
   - content: Trust by design
     isCorrect: false
     explanation: Incorrect. While designing systems with security in mind is important, this principle doesn't specifically address the need to validate only when necessary, which is essential for modern observability.
   - content: Trust by verification
     isCorrect: false
     explanation: Incorrect. Although verification is a key component of security, this principle doesn't fully capture the proactive and continuous nature of monitoring and validating activities required to modernize an observability platform.
