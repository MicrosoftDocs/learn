In this exercise, you create a Log Analytics workspace in the Azure portal. You then direct the audit and sign-in log files to your Log Analytics workspace. Finally, you use a workbook template to create a workbook that holds a query report.

In this exercise, you'll:

- Create a Log Analytics workspace.
- Send log files to your Log Analytics workspace.
- Use a workbook template to hold a query report.
- View your saved workbook.
