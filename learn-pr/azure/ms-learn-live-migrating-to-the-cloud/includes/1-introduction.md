Welcome to Microsoft Learn Live! Microsoft Learn Live is a series of guided, live courses, presented on Twitch, and designed to increase your existing knowledge of Azure technologies.

You can find all the details about Learn Live on our website at [http://aka.ms/learn-live](/training/?WT.mc_id=learnlive-video-learn).

## Series overview

Our first Learn Live series is titled "Migrate an ASP.NET Core application from an on-premises environment into Azure". We've created a scenario where we assume that you're a .NET developer working on an in-house system, and now it's time to make a move into the cloud. You work for a fictitious company called VanArsdel. VanArsdel is in the real estate business and they run a beautiful website where they're selling real estate property.

Check out this short trailer to get an overview of the technologies covered in the series.

## Use the Microsoft Learn Live Sandbox to get free access to Azure resources

We use Azure throughout this series to create resources like Azure App Services, Azure SQL Database, and Azure Storage. Some of these resources are available for free while others are paid offers. To follow along with our series, you have two options.

- Option 1: Using your own subscription gives you the benefit of having a persisted environment. From the first to the last session of our series, you can follow along and continue exactly where we left off. You must, however clean up unused resources manually to avoid unintended costs.
- Option 2: Use our Microsoft Learn Live Sandbox. The sandbox provides you with a concierge subscription and a temporary resource group. The sandbox deletes itself after four hours. You don't have to pay anything for the resources provided in the sandbox. The sandbox offers most of the Azure features needed for this series. Some resources, however, aren't available. If a feature is unavailable in the sandbox, we call it out explicitly during the delivery of the session. You'll find instructions how to activate the sandbox in the session preparation steps.
