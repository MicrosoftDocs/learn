So far, you've learned about what it really means to use Linux on Azure, and how to build solutions that take advantage of it and all of the other products and services that Azure has to offer. Here are some of the factors in making a decision to use Linux on Azure.

|||
| --- | --- |
| **Current development and deployment platform** | If your organization already uses Linux to develop and deploy software, Linux on Azure provides a native experience for your workloads. |
| **Simplified maintenance** | Whether you use IaaS or PaaS, or a mixture of both, Azure can simplify management, and reduce the infrastructure operation and maintenance overhead of your Linux-based applications. |
| **Elasticity** | Your Linux applications have instant scalability by deploying to virtual machine scale sets or scalable Azure PaaS platforms, like Azure App Service for Linux. |
| **Simplified and reduced costs** | Payment options for your business include pay-as-you-go, pre-paid software plans, Enterprise Agreement, and reserved instances. You can also bring your own license to use your existing investments more cost-effectively. |
| **Support** | Take advantage of technical experts directly from your Linux distribution publisher with integrated, co-located support from Red Hat and SUSE. The one-ticket-to-solution can help you with quicker troubleshooting. |
| **Jointly-developed solutions for specialized scenarios** | Solutions like SUSE Linux Enterprise Server for SAP and for HPC are available as ready-to-run VM images. Value-added services are built with partners such as Azure Oracle interconnect and Azure Red Hat OpenShift. These can make your transition to the cloud smoother, and you can offload the infrastructure maintenance to Microsoft and the Linux partner ecosystem. |
| **Neutral technology partner** | Microsoft is a neutral technology partner that doesn't aim to build services that compete with its customers. |
