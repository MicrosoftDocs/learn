In this module, we're going to focus on startup basics so that you have a solid guide to lead you on your journey with [Microsoft for Startups Founders Hub](https://startups.microsoft.com/?azure-portal=true).

We'll start by discussing some personal considerations:

- What's it really like to found a startup? (Not the hype, but the nuts and bolts of the journey and what to expect.)
- How to manage your time and energy.
- When to transition to building your business full-time.

We'll also discuss what makes a startup successful, and why having a business model that's repeatable and scalable is essential. Just as importantly, you'll learn about some of the most common reasons that startups fail so you can avoid making these mistakes.

Finally, we're going to talk about what founders should focus on in the first year of managing their startup. This discussion helps you map out the next few steps of your own journey.
