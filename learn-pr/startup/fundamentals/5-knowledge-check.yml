    - content: "Create a media release to attract as much media attention to your startup as possible."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Media attention can benefit your startup. But it's best to validate an idea with customers first, before you invest a significant amount of time in your business."

    choices:
    - content: "Addressing a large, growing market."

    - content: "Remaining a sole founder."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Sole founders struggle to cope with the amount of work needed to build and launch a startup. And by working alone, you miss out on the range of skill sets and perspectives that a team provides, and that contribute to success."
    - content: "A product that's inherently shareable."

    choices:
    - content: "Building a product before talking to potential customers."
      isCorrect: false

    - content: "Keeping the idea a secret until the product is launched."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. By keeping an idea secret, you risk depriving yourself of valuable feedback. You also fail to attract cofounders and collaborators. But it's not the only option."
    - content: "Taking advice from your cousin, who's a corporate tax lawyer."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Seeking advice from someone who doesn't have startup experience isn't beneficial. But it's not the only option."
    - content: "Trying to scale the company before you have problem-solution fit."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Attempting to scale based on a weak signal from a small number of users is a risky strategy. But it's not the only option."

      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Many factors can lead to failure. Examples include unnecessary secrecy and building a product before validating the idea with customers. Not seeking the right advice and scaling too early can also lead to failure."
