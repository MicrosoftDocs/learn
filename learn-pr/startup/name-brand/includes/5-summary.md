The goal of this module was to outline some steps that you can take to identify a good name for your startup, and then use this name as the foundation for a strong company brand. We used eight startup naming principles as a guide to help you choose a good name for your company. 

Here's a summary of what you learned:

- It's easy to pick a suboptimal name for your company. Doing this is unlikely to kill your company, but it can create friction and make it harder for potential customers to find you. It can also affect the credibility of your company's brand.
- Your company's name is one of the few things that you control completely, so try to get it right.
- If you aspire to be a global company, one of the key intellectual property assets that your company should own is the domain *\<your-company-name\>.com*.
- If you decide that you should change your company name, *now* is the best time for the change. It's never easy, but the longer you wait, the more difficult and expensive it'll be.
- Every startup founder should invest time in building their personal brand as a business leader and as the external face of their company. A strong personal brand adds credibility to your company's brand.
- Customers, investors, and future employees are seeking authentic communications from companies. Having a founder as the primary spokesperson for a company makes it easier for people to relate.
