  - content: "If you chose to name your company Relecloud, which of the startup naming principles would you be breaking?"
    choices:
    - content: "Future-proof."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The name Relecloud implies that the startup offers cloud services. If the company expands into other areas in the future, the name no longer reflects its business. Startup names should be future-proof, but it's not the only option."
    - content: "Free of infringements on existing trademarks."

      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A startup name shouldn't translate to something that's off-putting in another language. In Haitian Creole, *rele* means scream or howl, which isn't ideal for a tech firm. But it's not the only option."
    - content: "All of these principles."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The name Relecloud is hard to pronounce. It's not future-proof because the company might expand beyond cloud services at some point. Relecloud is trademarked and happens to mean scream or howl in Haitian Creole, which isn't ideal for a tech firm."
