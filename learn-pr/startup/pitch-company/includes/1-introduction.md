In this module, you'll learn how to deliver an effective presentation to persuade people that your company is worthy of their attention.

Pitching your company simply means that you explain the business to certain key people in a brief and compelling way. You can deliver a pitch to potential investors, customers, prospective employees, the media, or other key individuals or groups.

In this module, we mainly discuss how to pitch to potential investors, because they're likely the first and most critical audience in the life of your company. However, the principles we cover also apply to many other scenarios.

Pitching a business is a skill, and one that doesn't come naturally to most people. You learn it with practice, over time, by developing an understanding of how to convey ideas efficiently and convincingly to an audience.

At the end of this module, you'll look at several example startup pitches and have an opportunity to apply the techniques you learned toward building your own pitch.
