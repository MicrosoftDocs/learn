In this module, you'll see what makes a startup pitch effective.

## Attributes of a great startup pitch

By analyzing pitches delivered by large numbers of startups, you can distill them down to several common themes that emerge from the best of them. These themes are covered in the following sections.

### Clearly explained

Give your audience a clear, unambiguous understanding of your company in the first 30-60 seconds.

Use basic terms rather than jargon or flowery language. For example, "We provide a basic dashboard for banking customers to aggregate all of their bank feeds in one place" would be a clearer opening statement than "We're an AI-powered financial analytics company that's going to disrupt the consumer banking industry using innovative patented technology."

If there's a simple and obvious "we're the X for Y," use it here. For example, "Camplify is Airbnb for caravans and motor homes." Don't refer to an X unless you're confident 100 percent of your audience knows what X is.

It's surprisingly common for an audience to remain unclear about what the company does halfway through a pitch. This isn't a good situation!

### Engaging start

Great startup pitches engage the audience in the first 30 seconds. Then, make a clear argument for why your startup needs to exist, why it's solving an important problem, and why your audience should pay attention to the rest of the pitch. If you have a personal, authentic connection to the problem, this is a great time to explain it.

If you fail to engage the audience in the first 30 seconds, people will tune you out and begin checking their email or Twitter account. Immediate engagement is especially important if you're pitching at a demo day alongside many other startups.

If you've experienced great early traction, or anything else noteworthy, talk about it in the first 60 seconds. Nothing gets investors more excited about a business than telling them that it's making money and growing fast.

### Context

You might have spent the last 10 years of your life deeply immersed in a certain problem space, but it's likely that most of the audience hasn't. You'll need to explain the problem clearly, so that your solution and entire business model make sense in context.

Clear context is particularly important for deep-tech startups or those operating in narrow B2B niches, and less critical for consumer-focused startups.

### Incredulity

A lot of great startup pitches contain an element of surprise, some new fact or insight that has your audience thinking, "I had no idea the problem was this bad. It's amazing that nobody has solved it already!" This can be an effective way to set up your solution.

For example, if your startup is focused on helping nurses prepare hospital operating theaters, you might want to start by telling your audience that in X percent of medical procedures there's at least one missing item of essential equipment, and this simple oversight leads to Y thousand preventable deaths every year. By starting with this surprising revelation, you'll give your audience a much clearer understanding of the seriousness of the problem and, therefore, of the importance of your solution.

### An aha moment

There's often a point in good startup pitches where an audience realizes that what the company is doing is really exciting. You can help them reach this realization by using contrast.

For example, you might visually show the extent of the problem you're tackling (for example, with a photo showing how large companies still manage complex, high-risk projects by using a whiteboard and sticky notes), and then show the beautiful user interface of your product that will replace this inefficient and archaic method.

Sometimes, startups are based on a unique window of opportunity, such as a fundamental change in consumer behavior, technology, or regulatory environment. This change might be obvious to you, but not yet to your audience. By explaining why this change creates a fantastic window of opportunity for your company, you can help your audience reach an aha moment.

### Structure and flow

You can keep your audience engaged by having a logical structure to your pitch, outlining that structure at the outset, and then delivering that structure.

For example, at the beginning of your pitch, you might tell your audience that you're going to start by giving them some important context for the problem you're solving. Then, you might explain why it's important and why no one else has solved it. Next, you describe your solution and why your customers are signing up for it. You can then cover the business model and traction. Finally, you can talk about next steps and your funding round.

As you then step through each element of the pitch, your audience will remain more engaged, because they already have a rough road map in their minds and can see how each part of your pitch flows logically from the last part.

In contrast, if your pitch jumps around and doesn't follow a logical flow, or isn't in the order your audience is expecting, it'll be much more difficult for them to absorb.

## Design your PowerPoint presentation

Besides a sound message, a successful pitch also needs a polished delivery. An effective presentation includes clear, well-designed PowerPoint slides.

### Slides support the message

- Your slides should support the message that you're delivering verbally, not the other way around.
- Focus on communicating your key points verbally, Support them with images, charts, and other pieces of information, one idea per slide.
- It's tempting to try to cram a lot of content into your slides in the hope that they'll convey the key points. However, humans struggle to read and listen at the same time.
- Don't use your slides as a teleprompter. You're creating them for the audience, not for yourself.

### Simple text and images

If you have a lot of text or complexity on any of your slides, the audience will unconsciously try to read and make sense of it. They'll stop listening to you, and the important points you're making will be lost on them.

Simple images are much more effective in supporting the points that you make verbally.

### Large font size

Make the font size large enough for everyone in the room to read. This is especially important for pitches to large audiences, such as at an accelerator demo day. If possible, go to the venue before the event, stand in the back row, and step through each of your slides on the screen. If anything is too small to read, enlarge it or remove it.

The same principle applies to online pitches. Verify that everything in your slides is large enough to be read on a typical laptop screen while using whatever video platform will host the demo day.

### Polished design

The more important the pitch, the more attention should go into making the design polished and consistent with your company's brand. If you need the help of a designer, this small investment will more than pay for itself.

### Make it shareable

If you're pitching at a public event, or one that will be recorded and posted online, put your name, company name, and website URL on every slide. Doing so makes it easier for people to find out more about your company, and to share it with others.

### Display your product

If you've built a great product, be sure to display it in your presentation. It's been said (only somewhat facetiously) that the likelihood of a live product demo working is inversely proportional to the importance of the meeting. If you're feeling brave, do include a live demo in your pitch, but be prepared with at least one fallback solution, such as a prerecorded video walk-through of your product or a few attractive photos.

## Deliver a compelling pitch

After you've created your pitch and an accompanying PowerPoint deck, it's time to make sure you can deliver it in as convincing and compelling a way as possible.

Here are some practical tips for delivering a great pitch.

### Slow down

Speak more slowly than you think you should. You're asking your audience to process a large amount of new information, so make it easy for them by talking at a relaxed pace.

It's much easier to speak slowly when you know that the content you're going to deliver fits easily within the available time. When you're practicing your pitch, make sure that you consistently finish comfortably within the allotted time, so you don't feel pressured to rush through it.

If you have an accent that might make your speech difficult to understand, speak even more slowly and deliberately.

### Project your voice

All good performers learn how to project their voice. Although delivering a pitch should be more about the content than being theatrical, it's still important to know how to project so you can be heard and understood.

### Exude confidence

Smile and show confidence and sincerity, but not so much that it appears manufactured. Smiling not only helps you *appear* confident, but it can actually help you *feel* more relaxed and confident.

Knowing the content of your presentation thoroughly also makes it much easier to feel confident that you can deliver it without any missteps.

### Use inflection

Great presenters use inflection in their voice to convey meaning and emotion. By learning how to vary the volume, pitch, and timbre of your voice, you'll keep your audience much more engaged.

To learn how to use your voice to better convey meaning, view this [TED talk by Julian Treasure](https://www.ted.com/talks/julian_treasure_how_to_speak_so_that_people_want_to_listen?azure-portal=true).

### Pause at key moments

A deliberate pause can help you to underscore important points. It can also give you and your audience an opportunity to gather your thoughts before moving onto the next point.

### Identify and fix bad habits

Most people exhibit one or more bad habits when they're presenting. These habits can be vocal, such as frequently saying *um* or *you know* or *go right ahead and* or allowing their voice pitch to go up at the end of every sentence as if they're asking a question. The habits can be physical, such as wringing their hands, swaying from side to side, or bouncing up and down on their toes as they speak.

Such bad habits can be distracting for your audience, make you look nervous and unprofessional, and diminish the impact of your presentation.

Many people are completely unaware that they're doing these things, so the first step to fixing bad habits is to identify them. Consider practicing your pitch in front of some friends and asking them to point out any bad habits, or recording and playing back a video of yourself delivering your pitch.

By consciously practicing your pitch with your habits in mind, you'll be able to gradually remove them and improve your delivery.

### Avoid creating doubt

If you say something during a pitch that your audience doubts, even unconsciously, it [triggers the part of the brain, called the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, which processes doubt](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2012.00100/full?azure-portal=true). When it's activated, this part of the brain remains in a heightened state of activation for several minutes. During this period, everything else you say might be processed through a heightened sense of doubt.

Doubt can be triggered by something obvious (for example, if you were to claim, "We're building a social media company and we're going head-to-head with Facebook!"), and at other times the trigger might not be obvious.

You can identify non-obvious triggers of doubt by delivering your pitch to someone who's not involved in your startup and asking them to raise their hand the moment they begin experiencing even the slightest feeling of doubt.

After you've done this with a few test audiences, you'll be able to identify any points that consistently trigger their ventromedial prefrontal cortex, and either modify what you say or provide some supporting evidence immediately following.

### Call out the elephant in the room

If there's a potential major issue or obstacle of which your audience is likely to be aware, address it early in your presentation. For example, let's say one of your cofounders previously founded a company that's now being sued. Acknowledge the issue up front rather than let your audience wonder whether you're going to bring it up. Taking it off the table in this way allows everyone to focus on your presentation rather than on the elephant.

### Leave breadcrumbs

If there's something you want your audience to ask you about, mention it briefly in your presentation and note that you'd be happy to give more details at the end if time permits. This technique has been used by many startups to effectively guarantee that the first question they're asked is the one to which they're ready to give a great answer.

### Anticipate questions

You should be able to anticipate most of the questions that will come up from investors. Doing so will allow you to have answers at the ready, and perhaps even have a backup slide or two that address the questions. You can do this by road testing your presentation on a friendly investor audience (such as a mentor who has also been an investor), or even someone who's low on your investor wish list, and noting the questions that come up frequently.

### Iterate and practice

The biggest mistake that startup founders make with investor pitches is to not prepare sufficiently.

Unless you're an extremely practiced presenter, it's likely that your presentation will improve with each cycle of *deliver* > *feedback* > *edit*, up to about 20 iterations. The most useful feedback will come from people who've seen a lot of pitches (such as investors or experienced mentors), and the least useful will come from friends or family.

Practicing your pitch will help you to memorize it, allowing you to deliver it in a more authentic and relaxed way, rather than using all of your mental energy just to recall the content and delivering a stilted, nervous presentation.

Practicing also helps you to resist the temptation to repeatedly look at the slides on the screen while you're presenting. A good rule of thumb is to test, refine, and improve your presentation at least 10 times before you deliver it to an investor audience, and to practice at least one hour for every minute of your pitch. That is, to prepare a 20-minute investor presentation, you practice it at least 10 times, for a total of about 20 hours by the time you've settled on a final version.

> [!TIP]
> A great way to quickly familiarize yourself with the presentation content and practice thinking on your feet is to play the *slide shuffle game* with a friend. You print your presentation slides, shuffle them, and hand them to a friend. The friend holds up a slide at random, and you immediately begin presenting the content that's relevant to that slide. Continue through the entire deck.

Some people are tempted to script their entire pitch. This is generally not helpful, because few people can memorize an entire 20-minute presentation. Presenters tend to lose their train of thought partway through, and it can be difficult to regain it. Even if you do memorize the script, it might sound like you're reading something rather than speaking authentically.

Most people find it's helpful to script the first couple of sentences of a pitch. By doing this and rehearsing them until you could say them in your sleep, you'll be starting your presentation with confidence, knowing exactly what you plan to say at the outset. After the first couple of sentences, you'll relax into a more natural speaking style.

## What you've learned

- Pitching your business is a core skill that every startup founder should master. It's important to be able to pitch investors, and the skills also come into play in other scenarios. For example, you might need to explain to customers why they should buy your product or to potential new recruits why they should join your company.
- Compelling startup pitches generally have these attributes in common: clearly explained, engaging start, context, incredulity, an aha moment, structure, and flow.
- A great way to test whether your pitch is on track is to deliver it to someone who knows nothing about your company. Ask them to explain back to you what your company does. If they get it 90 percent right, you're doing a good job. If they struggle, that's a sign that you have more work to do.
