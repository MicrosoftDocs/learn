This module provided you with:

- A prompt to consider all of the areas you feel mentorship would benefit you.
- Guidance for doing research on your mentor and their areas of experience.
- Insights on how to best prepare, meet, and follow up with your mentor.

We worked through a meeting with a new mentor, from identifying topics to discuss through scheduling your next interaction. Now, you also have a variety of topics that may help guide your learning in other areas.

The following is a short list of conclusions you can draw from this module:

- Consider the areas where you or your company could use assistance. Before meeting with a mentor, you need to have a clear understanding of the areas where you can benefit from mentorship. This provides an opportunity to align a relevant opportunity for mentorship with your mentor's areas of expertise.
- Research and understand what your mentor brings to the conversation before that conversation happens. Given the prevalence of information online, you have ample opportunity to gain a better understanding of your mentor and their experiences before you meet. Using this to your advantage will result in far more impactful and engaging conversations.
- Your most important job is to further your relationship with your mentor. Doing your research, introducing structure, and communicating thoughtfully are all things that will make each mentorship opportunity more valuable for everyone.
- The best mentoring takes place over time, not in a single meeting. Making a good first impression and streamlining the process for the mentor ensures that you have the highest likelihood of meeting with your mentor again.
