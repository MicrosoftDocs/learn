Understanding the principles of user experience (UX) and design thinking are both crucial to developing an effective prototype and delivering a great experience for your users. User experience is how a user interacts with and experiences a product, service, or system. Design thinking is an approach to problem solving that focuses on innovation and creation. When user experience and design thinking are implemented into the startup journey, this serves as a method for users to validate that you're achieving product market fit.

Imagine that you decide to build an automated checkout software for sneaker lovers who want to stay ahead of the latest hyped sneaker releases without the hassle of manually waiting to check out items. Sneakers are generally available anywhere at your local retail store.

The high demand for new releases fueled by social media and the increased popularity of online sales has made it challenging for sneaker collectors to manually navigate the industry.

Due to the increased volume of shoppers looking to purchase limited inventory simultaneously, users generally have a difficult time successfully purchasing their desired items. KrashAIO is a SaaS platform built to allow users to emulate the manual online checkout process in a few simple clicks via a user-friendly dashboard, rather than risking missing a purchase on a regular retailer’s website due to high traffic.

When creating a product with UX and design thinking in mind, this allows users in this scenario to secure their purchases with ease without the headache of trying to beat the digital crowd as millions of others look to obtain their desired items. As your users’ needs evolve, you'll want to update the process to ensure your users are receiving the best possible experience.

## What will we be doing?

By the end of this module, you'll have a basic understanding of what user experience is and how it relates to the design thinking framework.
