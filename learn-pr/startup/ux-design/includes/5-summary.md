This module provided you with a basic understanding of what User Experience is, as well as more information about the Design Thinking framework and each of its five steps.

We used your fictional company, KrashAIO, as an example to see how you and your team would go from ideation to delivering a solution that provides more context on how the key factors of user experience relate to the Design Thinking framework and each of its five steps, as seen in the following table:

| Key Factor | Design Thinking Phase(s) | Example |
| ---------- | ------------------------ | ------- |
| Understanding the user | **Empathize** | To gain perspective and insights on the problem space, a survey was sent out to multiple sneaker communities, to understand their pain points as it relates to their unique online purchasing experience. |
| Challenging assumptions | **Define & Ideate** | At this point, your goal is to brainstorm possible solutions based on the user’s needs, thus helping them draft their user stories, which would later become their first set of features. |
| Creating solutions | **Prototype & Test** | At this stage, you can create some basic screen designs that allow the user to complete their primary goals and help satisfy the basic requirement for each feature. From there, it’s important to get the product out to your potential users so you’re able to receive key feedback from your learnings. |
