    - content: "You are creating an Azure Resource Manager template that defines a cloud solution comprising virtual machines, storage accounts, message queues, and other resources. The template is written in JSON. At run-time, you want to require users to select the Azure region region to which these resources are deployed. What is the proper way to accomplish that with an Azure Resource Manager template?"

        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect. The `parameters` section enables you to define parameters that users provide when the template is executed."
      - content: "Write a custom script that prompts the user to select a region and invoke the script from the template."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect. The `parameters` section enables you to define parameters that users provide when the template is executed."
