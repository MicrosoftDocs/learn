  questions:
    
    - content: "You are creating an Azure Resource Manager template that defines a cloud solution comprising virtual machines, storage accounts, message queues, and other resources. The template is written in JSON. At run-time, you want to require users to select the Azure region region to which these resources are deployed. What is the proper way to accomplish that with an Azure Resource Manager template?"
      choices:
      - content: "Define the region as an input parameter in the template's `parameters` section."
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "Correct! The `parameters` section enables you to define parameters that users provide when the template is executed."

        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect. The `parameters` section enables you to define parameters that users provide when the template is executed."
      - content: "Write a custom script that prompts the user to select a region and invoke the script from the template."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect. The `parameters` section enables you to define parameters that users provide when the template is executed."
      - content: "None of the above. Azure Resource Manager templates do not support user-defined parameters."

          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. Azure Resource Manager templates support certain aspects of a programming language, including the ability to use variables and parameters."
        - content: "Azure Resource Manager templates can be used to deploy resources to Azure and AWS."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct! Azure Resource Manager templates can only be used to deploy and update Azure resources."
