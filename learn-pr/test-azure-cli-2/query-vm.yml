   Now that a VM has been created, detailed information about it can be retrieved. The common command for getting information from a resource is
        `show`.

        ```azurecli
        az vm show --name TutorialVM1 --resource-group TutorialResources
        ```

        You'll see a lot of information, which can be difficult to parse visually. The returned JSON contains information on authentication, network interfaces, storage,
        and more. Most importantly,
        it contains the Azure object IDs for resources that the VM is connected to. Object IDs allow accessing these resources directly
        to get more information about the VM's configuration and capabilities.

        In order to extract the object ID we want, the `--query` argument is used. Queries are written in the [JMESPath query language](http://jmespath.org). Start
        with getting the network interface controller (NIC) object ID.

        ```azurecli
        az vm show --name TutorialVM1 \
          --resource-group TutorialResources \
          --query 'networkProfile.networkInterfaces[].id' \
          --output tsv
        ```

        There's a lot going on here, just by adding the query. Each part of it references a key in the output JSON, or is a JMESPath operator.

        * `networkProfile` is a key of the top-level JSON, which has `networkInterfaces` as a subkey. If a JSON value is a dictionary,
          its keys are referenced from the parent key with the `.` operator.
        * The `networkInterfaces` value is an array, so it is flattened with the `[]` operator. This operator runs the remainder
          of the query on each array element. In this case, it gets the `id` value of every array element.

        The output format `tsv` (tab-separated values) is guaranteed to only include the result data and whitespace consisting of tabs and newlines.
        Since the returned value is a single bare string, it's safe to assign directly to an environment variable.

        Go ahead and assign the NIC object ID to an environment variable now.

        ```bash
        NIC_ID=$(az vm show -n TutorialVM1 -g TutorialResources \
          --query 'networkProfile.networkInterfaces[].id' \
          -o tsv)
        ```

        This example also demonstrates the use of short arguments. You may use `-g` instead of `--resource-group`, `-n` instead of `--name`, and `-o` instead of `--output`.
