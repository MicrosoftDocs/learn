- Educator professional development training and courses

As the Microsoft Educator center merges with Microsoft Learn it will become the single training hub to empower digital classrooms.

## Modules and learning paths

Most of our training content is in the form of *modules*, which are organized into a series of *learning paths*. Modules are shorter courses, typically 30-60 minutes, that consist of pages called units. Learning paths are a series of modules centered around mastery of a particular topic. If you came from MEC, a module is the equivalent of a course and a learning path is the equivalent of a learning path.

## Browse and search for educator content

Learn has thousands of modules and learning paths to help you get started with Microsoft products. To browse content, go to the Learn "browse all" page at [docs.microsoft.com/learn/browse/](/learn/browse/)

- *Product* filters by educational tools such as Microsoft Teams, Immersive Reader, Reading Progress, OneNote, Minecraft, Flipgrid, Windows, PowerPoint, Forms, Edge, OneDrive, Sway, and many more.
- *Role* filters by the category that fits you best as a K-12 Educator, Higher-ed Educator, School Leader, or Parent & Guardian.
- *Level* filters by your appropriate experience level with content designated as beginner, intermediate or advanced.
