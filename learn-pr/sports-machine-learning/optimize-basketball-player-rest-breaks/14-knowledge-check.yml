  questions:
  - content: "What type of machine learning model is effective for predicting one value based on many other values?"
    choices:
    - content: "Decision tree"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Decision trees typically are used in classification problems."
    - content: "Principal component analysis, or PCA"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. PCA typically is used in anomaly detection problems."
    - content: "K-means"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. K-means typically is used in clustering problems."
    - content: "Linear regression"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Regression is the act of taking many complex data pieces and determining a numerical outcome."
  - content: "What is one way to create randomized sample data that is close to accurate?"
    choices:
    - content: "Use a random number within the standard deviation of input values for a machine learning algorithm."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The standard deviation represents a reasonable range of values for an accurate prediction."
    - content: "Use `random.randrange`, with the smallest and largest number of input values."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Although it's *possible* that a random number within that range is effective, the standard deviation will give a more accurate range."
    - content: "It's never useful to create randomized sample data."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Although randomized sample data shouldn't be used to make critical decisions, they can serve as effective testing data."
    - content: "Any integer between 0 and 100."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Although it's *possible* that a random number within that range is effective, the standard deviation will give a more accurate range."
  - content: "Static web apps in Azure take significant expertise to develop and deploy."
    choices:
    - content: "True - Static web apps in Azure typically are used by web developers with decades of experience."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Static web apps in Azure, although powerful for professionals, also are novice-friendly!"
    - content: "True - Static web apps in Azure are only for expert Flask developers."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Although there is a Microsoft Learn module that guides you through creating and deploying a Flask app by using static web apps in Azure, that's just one of many options, and they can be novice-friendly!"
    - content: "False - Static web apps in Azure have many entry points and can be novice-friendly."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Static web apps in Azure can be created and deployed in numerous ways and for numerous languages, some more novice-friendly and others better for more experienced developers."
    - content: "False - Static web apps in Azure are only for learners who are just starting out."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Although there are entry points to using static web apps in Azure for novices, there are also many ways they can support more experienced developers' workflows."
