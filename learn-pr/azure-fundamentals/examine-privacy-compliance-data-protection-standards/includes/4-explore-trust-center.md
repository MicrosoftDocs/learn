Tailwind Traders needs to stay up to date on the latest security standards for protecting its data. Today, the security team needs to verify whether Azure meets ISO 27001, a commonly used information security standard. Where can the company access this information?

The [Trust Center](https://www.microsoft.com/trust-center?rtc=1?azure-portal=true) showcases Microsoft's principles for maintaining data integrity in the cloud and how Microsoft implements and supports security, privacy, compliance, and transparency in all Microsoft cloud products and services. The Trust Center is an important part of the Microsoft Trusted Cloud Initiative and provides support and resources for the legal and compliance community.

The Trust Center provides:

 -  In-depth information about security, privacy, compliance offerings, policies, features, and practices across Microsoft cloud products.
 -  Additional resources for each topic.
 -  Links to the security, privacy, and compliance blogs and upcoming events.

The Trust Center is a great resource for other people in your organization who might play a role in security, privacy, and compliance. These people include business managers, risk assessment and privacy officers, and legal compliance teams.
