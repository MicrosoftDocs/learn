  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "You need to predict future behavior based on previous actions. Which product option should you select as a candidate?"
    choices:
    - content: "Azure Machine Learning"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Azure Machine Learning enables you to build models to predict the likelihood of a future result. It shouldn't be eliminated as a candidate."
    - content: "Azure Bot Service"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Azure Bot Service doesn't help with prediction. It should be eliminated as a candidate."
    - content: "Azure Cognitive Services"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The Personalizer service is part of Azure Cognitive Services and allows you to build recommendations to predict what a user might want.  It should be eliminated as a candidate."
  - content: "You need to create a human-computer interface that uses natural language to answer customer questions. Which product option should you select as a candidate?"
    choices:
    - content: "Azure Machine Learning"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Although Azure Machine Learning could be used to create a natural language model, it would likely be cost and time prohibitive.  It should be eliminated as a candidate."
    - content: "Azure Cognitive Services"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Azure Cognitive Services provides natural language services. It should be eliminated as a candidate."
    - content: "Azure Bot Service"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Azure Bot Service creates virtual agent solutions that utilize natural language. It shouldn't be eliminated as a candidate."
  - content: "You need to identify the content of product images to automatically create alt tags for images formatted properly.  Which product option is the best candidate?"
    choices:
    - content: "Azure Machine Learning"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Azure Machine Learning could be used to identify the content of product images. However, creating a model to identify the content of images would be cost and time prohibitive. Azure Machine Learning isn't the best candidate."
    - content: "Azure Cognitive Services"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Azure Cognitive Services includes Vision services that can identify the content of an image.  Azure Cognitive Services is the best candidate."
    - content: "Azure Bot Service"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Azure Bot Service can't identify the content of product images.  Azure Bot Service isn't the best candidate."
