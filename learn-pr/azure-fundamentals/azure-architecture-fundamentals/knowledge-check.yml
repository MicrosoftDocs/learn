  questions:
  - content: "Which of the following can be used to manage governance across multiple Azure subscriptions?"
    choices:
    - content: "Azure initiatives"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Azure initiatives are part of policies, not subscriptions."
    - content: "Management groups"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Management groups facilitate the hierarchical ordering of Azure resources into collections, at a level of scope above subscriptions. Distinct governance conditions can be applied to each management group, along with Azure Policy and Azure role-based access controls, to manage Azure subscriptions effectively. The resources and subscriptions assigned to a management group automatically inherit the conditions applied to the management group."
