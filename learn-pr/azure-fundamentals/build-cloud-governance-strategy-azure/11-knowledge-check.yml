quiz:
  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "How can Tailwind Traders allow some users to control the virtual machines in each environment but prevent them from modifying networking and other resources in the same resource group or Azure subscription?"
    choices:
    - content: "Create a role assignment through Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC)."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Azure RBAC enables you to create roles that define access permissions. You might create one role that limits access only to virtual machines and a second role that provides administrators with access to everything."
    - content: "Create a policy in Azure Policy that audits resource usage."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Although you might be able to audit how your resources are used, is there a way to _prevent_ users from changing resources they're not meant to access?"
    - content: "Split the environment into separate resource groups."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Resource groups are meant to contain related resources. Although you can likely split the environment into separate resource groups, this approach would likely be more complex than is needed."
  - content: "Which is the best way for Tailwind Traders to ensure that the team deploys only cost-effective virtual machine SKU sizes?"
    choices:
    - content: "Create a policy in Azure Policy that specifies the allowed SKU sizes."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. After you enable this policy, that policy is applied when you create new virtual machines or resize existing ones. Azure Policy also evaluates any current virtual machines in your environment."
    - content: "Periodically inspect the deployment manually to see which SKU sizes are used."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Is there a more automated way to verify that allowed SKU sizes are used before virtual machines are deployed?"
    - content: "Create an Azure RBAC role that defines the allowed virtual machine SKU sizes."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Azure RBAC enables you to create roles that define access permissions, but it doesn't enable you to define allowed virtual machine SKU sizes."
  - content: "Which is likely the best way for Tailwind Traders to identify which billing department each Azure resource belongs to?"
    choices:
    - content: "Track resource usage in a spreadsheet."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This form of tracking is manual and prone to errors. Is there a more automated way to track resource usage?"
    - content: "Split the deployment into separate Azure subscriptions, where each subscription belongs to its own billing department."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Although you can use subscriptions to separate billing by department, is there another method that allows all resources to stay within the same subscription?"
    - content: "Apply a tag to each resource that includes the associated billing department."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Tags provide extra information, or metadata, about your resources. The team might create a tag that's named **BillingDept** whose value would be the name of the billing department. You can use Azure Policy to ensure that the proper tags are assigned when resources are provisioned."
