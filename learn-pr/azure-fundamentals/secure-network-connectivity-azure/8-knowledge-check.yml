  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: An attacker can bring down your website by sending a large volume of network traffic to your servers. Which Azure service can help Tailwind Traders protect its App Service instance from this kind of attack?
    choices:
    - content: Azure Firewall
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Azure Firewall enables you to create network rules that define source address, protocol, destination port, and destination address. It doesn't specifically help against DDoS attacks.
    - content: Network security groups
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Network security groups enable you to filter network traffic to and from Azure resources within a virtual network. They don't specifically help against DDoS attacks.
    - content: Azure DDoS Protection
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: DDoS Protection helps protect your Azure resources from DDoS attacks. A DDoS attack attempts to overwhelm and exhaust an application's resources, making the application slow or unresponsive to legitimate users.
  - content: What's the best way for Tailwind Traders to limit all outbound traffic from VMs to known hosts?
    choices:
    - content: Configure Azure DDoS Protection to limit network access to trusted ports and hosts.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: DDoS Protection helps protect your Azure resources from DDoS attacks, but it doesn't act as a general-purpose firewall.
    - content: Create application rules in Azure Firewall.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Azure Firewall enables you to limit outbound HTTP/S traffic to a specified list of fully qualified domain names (FQDNs).
    - content: Ensure that all running applications communicate with only trusted ports and hosts.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Is there a way to more easily configure network access without software modifications?
  - content: How can Tailwind Traders most easily implement a _deny by default_ policy so that VMs can't connect to each other?
    choices:
    - content: Allocate each VM on its own virtual network.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Although you can isolate each VM by placing it on a separate virtual network, is there an easier way that allows all VMs to safely exist on the same virtual network?
    - content: Create a network security group rule that prevents access from another VM on the same network.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: A network security group rule enables you to filter traffic to and from resources by source and destination IP address, port, and protocol.
    - content: Configure Azure DDoS Protection to limit network access within the virtual network.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: DDoS Protection helps protect your Azure resources from DDoS attacks, but it doesn't specify connection rules within a virtual network.
