  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "Which is the best first step the team should take to compare the cost of running these environments on Azure versus in their datacenter?"
    choices:
    - content: "They're just test environments. Spin them up and check the bill at the end of the month."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Costs can add up. It's important to understand the full cost of running your solution, whether it's in the datacenter or in the cloud."
    - content: "Assume that running in the cloud costs about the same as running in the datacenter."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Running on Azure can actually _save_ money. But only a thorough cost assessment can tell you with certainty."
    - content: "Run the Total Cost of Ownership Calculator."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Running the Total Cost of Ownership Calculator is a great first step because it can provide an accurate comparison of running workloads in the datacenter versus on Azure, certified by an independent research company."
  - content: "What's the best way to ensure that the development team doesn't provision too many virtual machines at the same time?"
    choices:
    - content: "Do nothing. Let the development team use what they need."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Although you might want to enable the development team to use what they need, you might want to consider ways to prevent _accidental_ spending."
    - content: "Apply spending limits to the development team's Azure subscription."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "If you exceed your spending limit, active resources are deallocated. You can then decide whether to increase your limit or provision fewer resources."
    - content: "Verbally give the development lead a budget and hold them accountable for overages."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Although it's good for everyone to agree on a budget, are there controls you can put in place to _automatically_ check spending?"
  - content: "Which is the most efficient way for the testing team to save costs on virtual machines on weekends, when testers are not at work?"
    choices:
    - content: "Delete the virtual machines before the weekend and create a new set the following week."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Although you can delete your virtual machines when they're not in use, you also lose any associated hard disks. It can take some time to re-create the environment at the start of each week."
    - content: "Deallocate virtual machines when they're not in use."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "When you deallocate virtual machines, the associated hard disks and data are still kept in Azure. But you don't pay for CPU or network consumption, which can help save costs."
    - content: "Just let everything run. Azure bills you only for the CPU time that you use."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Usage meters track not only CPU time but also network traffic and the number of disk operations."
  - content: "Resources in the Dev and Test environments are each paid for by different departments. What's the best way to categorize costs by department?"
    choices:
    - content: "Apply a tag to each virtual machine that identifies the appropriate billing department."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "You can apply tags to groups of Azure resources to organize billing data."
    - content: "Split the cost evenly between departments."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Each environment might consume different amounts of Azure resources. Is there a way to better identify which department is consuming which resources?"
    - content: "Keep a spreadsheet that lists each team's resources."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "What's in your spreadsheet and what's in your Azure subscription can easily drift. Is there a way to associate usage more directly?"
