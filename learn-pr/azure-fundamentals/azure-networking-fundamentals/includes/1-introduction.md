The servers that host Tailwind Traders' customer and product data are based in Silicon Valley. Your company also has several branch offices located in different geographic regions.

To help save costs, you convince your team to move your website and several of your other networked resources to the cloud. With that in mind, you need to provide secure access to private company data for each of its branch locations. You want to know how Azure can help you manage your network more effectively. As it turns out, managing networks on Azure isn't entirely different from managing on-premises networks.

In this module, you learn about the different Azure networking options and the scenarios in which each is appropriate.
