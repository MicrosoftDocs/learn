Suppose your company, Tailwind Traders, has many product brochures, datasheets, product images, and other files that are related to marketing, sales, and support. In the past, your company has been hosting these files on standalone web servers in your datacenter.

Your company is now in the process of migrating its applications to the cloud, and your development team is currently architecting new applications. Your Chief Technology Officer (CTO) wants to migrate all of your marketing, sales, and support files to the cloud in order to take advantage of geographic distribution of your files. This move also reduces the number of physical servers that your company maintains in your datacenter. As part of your migration strategy, you need to determine the correct approach for your cloud-based storage infrastructure.
