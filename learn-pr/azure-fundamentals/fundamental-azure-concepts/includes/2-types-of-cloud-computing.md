## What are public, private, and hybrid clouds?

There are three deployment models for cloud computing: *public cloud*, *private cloud*, and *hybrid cloud*. Each deployment model has different aspects that you should consider as you migrate to the cloud.

    Services are offered over the public internet and available to anyone who wants to purchase them. Cloud resources, such as servers and storage, are owned and operated by a third-party cloud service provider, and delivered over the internet.

    **Private cloud**
  :::column-end:::
  :::column:::
    A private cloud consists of computing resources used exclusively by users from one business or organization. A private cloud can be physically located at your organization's on-site (on-premises) datacenter, or it can be hosted by a third-party service provider.

    A hybrid cloud is a computing environment that combines a public cloud and a private cloud by allowing data and applications to be shared between them.

## Cloud model comparison

### Public cloud

 -  No capital expenditures to scale up.
 -  Applications can be quickly provisioned and deprovisioned.
 -  Organizations pay only for what they use.

### Private cloud

 -  Hardware must be purchased for start-up and maintenance.
 -  Organizations have complete control over resources and security.
 -  Organizations are responsible for hardware maintenance and updates.

### Hybrid cloud

 -  Provides the most flexibility.
 -  Organizations determine where to run their applications.
 -  Organizations control security, compliance, or legal requirements.
