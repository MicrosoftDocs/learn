  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "How can Tailwind Traders enforce having only certain applications run on its VMs?"
    choices:
    - content: "Connect your VMs to Azure Sentinel."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Azure Sentinel enables you to aggregate security data from many different sources to provide additional capabilities for threat detection and responding to threats."
    - content: "Create an application control rule in Azure Security Center."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. With Azure Security Center, you can define a list of allowed applications to ensure that only applications you allow can run. Azure Security Center can also detect and block malware from being installed on your VMs."
    - content: "Periodically run a script that lists the running processes on each VM. The IT manager can then shut down any applications that shouldn't be running."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Although you could follow this approach, it's tedious, time-consuming, and prone to errors. Is there a more automated approach that the company can take?"
  - content: "What's the easiest way for Tailwind Traders to combine security data from all of its monitoring tools into a single report that it can take action on?"
    choices:
    - content: "Collect security data in Azure Sentinel."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Azure Sentinel is Microsoft's cloud-based SIEM. A SIEM aggregates security data from many different sources to provide additional capabilities for threat detection and responding to threats."
    - content: "Build a custom tool that collects security data, and displays a report through a web application."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Although you could take this approach, is there a fully featured service on Azure that provides this functionality?"
    - content: "Look through each security log daily and email a summary to your team."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This approach is time-consuming. It might also delay important security events from being addressed."
  - content: "Which is the best way for Tailwind Traders to safely store its certificates so that they're accessible to cloud VMs?"
    choices:
    - content: "Place the certificates on a network share."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Although you could place your certificates on a network share, is there a service that can handle secure access and enrollment for you?"
    - content: "Store them on a VM that's protected by a password."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Although you could do this, it's less secure. Plus, you'd then need a way to safely manage your password. Is there a service that can handle secure access and enrollment for you?"
    - content: "Store the certificates in Azure Key Vault."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Azure Key Vault enables you to store your secrets in a single, central location. Key Vault also makes it easier to enroll and renew certificates from public certificate authorities (CAs)."
  - content: "How can Tailwind Traders ensure that certain VM workloads are physically isolated from workloads being run by other Azure customers?"
    choices:
    - content: "Configure the network to ensure that VMs on the same physical host are isolated."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. On Azure, it's not necessary to configure the network to isolate VMs on the same physical host. Doing so also might not satisfy regulatory requirements."
    - content: "This is not possible. These workloads need to be run on-premises."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Is there an Azure service that provides dedicated physical servers to host your VMs for Windows and Linux?"
    - content: "Run the VMs on Azure Dedicated Host."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Azure Dedicated Host provides dedicated physical servers to host your Azure VMs for Windows and Linux."
