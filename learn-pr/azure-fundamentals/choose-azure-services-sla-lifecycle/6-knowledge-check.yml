  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "What's the SLA for Azure Maps in terms of guaranteed uptime?"
    choices:
    - content: "99 percent"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. See the [SLA for Azure Maps](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/sla/azure-maps?azure-portal=true) to get the SLA."
    - content: "99.9 percent"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. The [SLA for Azure Maps](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/sla/azure-maps?azure-portal=true) tells you the SLA."
    - content: "99.99 percent"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. See the [SLA for Azure Maps](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/sla/azure-maps?azure-portal=true) to get the SLA."
  - content: "What's the new composite SLA? Remember, the new SLA includes a third virtual machine and Azure Maps."
    choices:
    - content: "99.58 percent"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. To compute the composite SLA for a set of services, you multiply the SLA of each individual service."
    - content: "99.78 percent"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The composite SLA is lower because adding complexity slightly increases the risk of failure."
    - content: "99.99 percent"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The composite SLA is lower than the highest individual SLA because adding complexity slightly increases the risk of failure."
  - content: "Adding a third virtual machine reduces the composite SLA. How can Tailwind Traders offset this reduction?"
    choices:
    - content: "Increase the size of each virtual machine."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The size of a virtual machine does not affect its SLA."
    - content: "Deploy extra instances of the same virtual machines across the different availability zones in the same Azure region."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. If one availability zone is affected, your virtual machine instance in the other availability zone should be unaffected."
    - content: "Do nothing. Using Azure Load Balancer increases the SLA for virtual machines."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Although Load Balancer can improve performance by distributing traffic, each service will factor separately into the overall SLA."
  - content: "What approach might the company take in adding the augmented reality (AR) preview service to its architecture?"
    choices:
    - content: "The Special Orders app is already in production. The company shouldn't look into the AR service until the service reaches general availability (GA)."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Although you don't want to rely on preview services in production, are there ways that the team can begin to at least explore the service?"
    - content: "The Special Orders app is mainly for use by retail employees. The company can integrate the AR service now because potential downtime or failures aren't an important factor."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Even though the app is used primarily by retail employees, it's still critical to the business. If the app isn't available or it fails, customers will be disappointed or go to a competitor."
    - content: "The development team can create a prototype version of the app that includes the AR service that it can then test out with select retail employees."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. After the AR service reaches general availability (GA), the team can roll it out to production."
