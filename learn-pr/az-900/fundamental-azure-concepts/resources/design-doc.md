## Prerequisites

- You should be familiar with basic computing concepts and terminology
- Familiarity with cloud computing is helpful, but isn't necessary

## Summary

Tailwind Traders has some new IT staff that they need to get up to speed on the basics of cloud computing. In this session you'll learn about the fundamental concepts of cloud computing and how Azure implements these concepts.

## Learning objectives

Upon completion of this module, the learner will be able to:

- Identify the benefits and considerations of using cloud services
- Describe the differences between categories of cloud services
- Describe the differences between types of cloud computing

## Chunk your content into subtasks

## Outline the units

1. **Introduction**

    Identify the benefits and considerations of using cloud services

1. **Describe the benefits of cloud computing**

    - **Shared responsibility model**

    - **What are some cloud computing advantages?**

        There are several benefits that a cloud environment has over a physical environment. For example, cloud-based applications employ a myriad of related strategies:

        - **High Availability** - depending on the service-level agreement (SLA) that you choose, your cloud[based applications can provide a continuous user experience with no apparent downtime even when things go wrong

        - **Scalability** - applications in the cloud can be scaled two ways:

           - *Vertically* - computing capacity can be increased by adding additional RAM or CPUs to a virtual machine
           - *Horizontally* - computing capacity can be increased by adding instances of a resource, such as adding additional virtual machines to your configuration

        - **Elasticity** - cloud-based applications can be configured to take advantage of autoscaling, so your applications will always have the resources they need

        - **Agility** - cloud-based resources can be deployed and configured quickly as your application requirements change

        - **Geo-distribution** - applications and data can be deployed to regional data centers around the globe, thereby ensuring that your customers always have the best performance in their region

        - **Disaster Recovery** - by taking advantage of cloud-based backup services, data replication, and geo-distribution, you can deploy your applications with the confidence that comes from knowing that your data is safe in the event that disaster should occur

    - **Identify the differences between CapEX and OpEx**

    - **Describe the consumption based model**

1. **Describe the different categories of cloud services**

    - **Describe IaaS**

    - **Describe PaaS**

    - **Describe SaaS**

    - **Describe serverless computing **

    - **Identify a service type based on use case**

1. **Describe the different types of cloud computing**

    - **Define cloud computing**

    - **Describe Public cloud**

    - **Describe Private cloud**

    - **Describe Hybrid cloud**

    - **Compare and contrast the three types of cloud computing**
