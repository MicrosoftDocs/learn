Throughout the Azure Fundamentals Learning Paths, we'll be working with a fictional company named *Tailwind Traders*, which manufactures hardware products. For the purposes of discussion, let's suppose that you work as an Information Technology (IT) specialist for the company.

Your company currently manages an on-premises datacenter that hosts your company's retail website, and stores that data and streaming video for your applications. Your IT department is currently responsible for all of management tasks for your computing hardware and software; for example: your IT team handles the procurement process to buy new hardware, installs and configures software, and deploys everything throughout your datacenter.

However, these management responsibilities create numerous obstacles for delivering your applications to your users in a timely fashion. As a technology professional, you realize that it would be advantageous to have servers, storage, databases, and other services immediately available when developing and deploying applications. You should be able to click a button to start up a new server or add services to your solutions.

As you've seen in the other units of this learning module, your company's needs can be addressed through various cloud-based services. With that in mind, the services that are available through Microsoft Azure can help your company conduct its business more efficiently.

As you complete the various modules in the Azure Fundamentals Learning Paths, we'll analyze the various challenges that Tailwind Traders is facing, and how you can Microsoft Azure services to address each of those issues as they arise. When you've completed each of the modules, the knowledge that you will have gained from resolving the hypothetical problems that the fictional Tailwind Traders company was encountering should benefit you in your real world environments, and help to prepare you for the Azure Fundamentals AZ-900 exam.
