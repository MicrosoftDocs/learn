## REQUIRED: Use Content Best Practices

Good content should always follow these best practices:

- [ ] Follow authoring guidelines (https://aka.ms/learn/id)
- [ ] Adhere to style guidelines (https://aka.ms/acrolinx)

## REQUIRED: Incorporate Structural Methodology

Modules should adhere to these guidelines:

### Modules

- [ ] Modules Exist as completely independent/self-sufficient (no cross-module dependencies)
- [ ] Have 2 to 4 accurate and measurable learning objectives (https://review.docs.microsoft.com/learn-docs/docs/id-guidance-learning-objectives)
- [ ] List accurate prerequisites (https://review.docs.microsoft.com/learn-docs/docs/id-guidance-prerequisites)
- [ ] Modules conform to one of these structures:
    - Standard Modules (https://review.docs.microsoft.com/learn-docs/docs/id-guidance-standardmodules)
    - Introduction Modules (https://review.docs.microsoft.com/learn-docs/docs/id-guidance-intromodules)
    - Choose Modules (https://review.docs.microsoft.com/learn-docs/docs/id-guidance-choosemodules)

### Units

- [ ] Units conform to one of these structures:
    - Conceptual Units (https://review.docs.microsoft.com/learn-docs/docs/id-guidance-structure-learning-content)
    - Exercise Units (https://review.docs.microsoft.com/learn-docs/docs/id-guidance-structure-exercise-content)
- [ ] Reinforce all conceptual information with an exercise or knowledge check
- [ ] All exercise units have *Exercise - * prefix on titles
- [ ] Avoid back-to-back exercise units

## RECOMMENDED: Utilize Learn-specific Features

When appropriate, modules should try to incorporate these features of the Learn platform:

- [ ] Sandbox (https://review.docs.microsoft.com/learn-docs/docs/unit-labs-add-an-azure-sandbox-lab)
- [ ] Interactive Cloud Shell (https://review.docs.microsoft.com/learn-docs/docs/unit-labs-sandbox-use-the-cloudshell)
- [ ] In-browser .NET Editor (https://review.docs.microsoft.com/learn-docs/docs/unit-labs-sandbox-use-the-cloudshell)
- [ ] Zone Pivots (https://review.docs.microsoft.com/learn-docs/docs/unit-add-zone-pivots)
- [ ] Knowledge Checks (https://review.docs.microsoft.com/learn-docs/docs/unit-add-a-knowledge-check)
- [ ] Task Validation (https://review.docs.microsoft.com/learn-docs/docs/unit-labs-sandbox-add-task-validation)
- [ ] Virtual Machines (https://review.docs.microsoft.com/learn-docs/docs/unit-labs-add-a-vm-lab)

## RECOMMENDED: Utilize Media

When possible, modules should try to use media to reinforce conceptual information:

- [ ] Media (images/videos) appear early in a module (landing or 1st unit)
- [ ] Use Screenshots and images to split up text sections (https://review.docs.microsoft.com/learn-docs/docs/unit-add-artwork)
- [ ] Use 1-3 short videos per module (for most-important/highest-tracked modules; https://review.docs.microsoft.com/learn-docs/docs/unit-add-video)
- [ ] Use motion graphics / GIFs to explain complex ideas (https://review.docs.microsoft.com/learn-docs/docs/unit-add-artwork)

## RECOMMENDED: Things to Avoid

When possible, modules should try not to use the following:

- [ ] Downloaded code - while sometimes necessary - should be avoided when possible (e.g. using curl or git to download a pre-built application)
