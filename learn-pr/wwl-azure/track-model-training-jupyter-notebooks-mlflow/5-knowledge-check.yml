quiz:
  questions:
  - content: "You want to train a diabetes classification model with the scikit-learn library. You want to focus on experimenting with the model, and minimize the effort needed to log the model's results. Which logging method should you use?"
    choices:
    - content: "Autologging"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. You can use autologging with scikit-learn. Enabling autologging minimizes the effort needed to log the model's results."
    - content: "Custom logging"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. You have to manually log any parameters, metrics, or artifacts."
    - content: "A combination of autologging and custom logging."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Custom logging won't minimize the effort."
  - content: "When you use MLflow tracking when training a model in a notebook running on Azure Machine Learning compute, on which tab in the studio can you view the model's results?"
    choices:
    - content: "Data"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Data shows the registered data assets and data stores."
    - content: "Models"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The Models tab shows the registered models."
    - content: "Jobs"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Jobs shows the MLflow experiment runs including all metadata and logged parameters, metrics, and artifacts."
