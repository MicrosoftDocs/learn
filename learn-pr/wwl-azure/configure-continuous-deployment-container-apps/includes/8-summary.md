In this module, you have learned about continuous deployment options for container apps. Azure Container Apps implements container app versioning by creating revisions. You can create new revisions by updating a previous revision, and you can retain up to 100 revisions, giving you a historical record of your container app updates. Azure Container Apps provides support for continuous deployment using either GitHub Actions or Azure Pipelines. The scenarios describe continuous deployments to a container app connected to a container registry.

The main takeaways from this module are that Azure Container Apps implements container app versioning by creating revisions, which allows you to retain a historical record of your container app updates. Additionally, Azure Container Apps provides support for continuous deployment using either GitHub Actions or Azure Pipelines, which allows you to automate the deployment process and ensure that your container app is always up-to-date.
