This module describes the continuous deployment options for container apps in Azure Container Apps. The module covers how to use Azure Pipelines to automate build, test, and deployment processes. The module also describes how to use environment and secret variables in your pipelines.

## Scenario

Imagine you are a developer working for a software development company that specializes in building containerized applications. Your team is tasked with deploying and managing container apps in Azure Container Apps. However, you are unsure about the continuous deployment options available and how to implement them effectively. You need a solution that allows for seamless updates to container images and creates new revisions of the app based on those updates. This solution ensures that your team can continuously deploy new features and bug fixes without disrupting the application's availability. In addition, you want to apply the benefits of versioning and have a historical record of updates for auditing purposes. You decide to investigate Azure DevOps and Azure Pipelines. By understanding the continuous deployment options in Azure Container Apps, you are able to streamline your deployment process and improve the overall efficiency of your development workflow.
