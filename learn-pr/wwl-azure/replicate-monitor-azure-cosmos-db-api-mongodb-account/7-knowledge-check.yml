quiz:
  questions:
  - content: "Why would a 16500 exception occur?"
    choices:
    - content: "Because the query exceeded the memory limit."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Exception 16501 occurs when the memory limits are exceeded."
    - content: "Because the query tried to consume more request than the provisioned rate."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Exception 16500 occurs when the request-unit rate is throttled because the total number of request units consumed is more than the provisioned request-unit rate for the collection."
    - content: "Because the query tried to insert a duplicate key."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Trying to insert a duplicate shard key would raise exception 11000."
  - content: "Where would the Azure diagnostic logs be forwarded to, if KQL (Kusto Query Language) is used to query the logs?"
    choices:
    - content: "Stream to an event hub"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Data is sent to an Event Hubs as it reaches Azure Monitor and exported to destinations located in workspace region. The stream itself isn't directly queried using KQL (Kusto Query Language)."
    - content: "Archive to a storage account"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The format of blobs in Storage Account is in JSON lines, where a new line delimits each record, with no outer records array and no commas between JSON records. These blobs aren't queried using KQL (Kusto Query Language)."
    - content: "Sent to Log Analytics workspace"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The diagnostic logs are written into tables that can then be queried using KQL (Kusto Query Language)."
  - content: "Which conflict resolution policy does the Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB use?"
    choices:
    - content: "First write wins."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. There's no such policy. The default policy would be Last Write Wins (LWW)."
    - content: "Custom numerical property."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This policy is only available for Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL."
    - content: "Last Write Wins."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. This policy uses the timestamp (_ts) to determine which document wrote last. In simple terms, if multiple documents are in conflict, the document with the largest value for the _ts property wins."
