quiz:
  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "What method does Microsoft Azure App Service use to obtain credentials for users attempting to access an app?"
    choices:
    - content: "Credentials are stored in the browser"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Never want to use browser stored credentials for secure access to an application."
    - content: "Pass-through authentication"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Pass-through authentication is for Azure AD Connect."
    - content: "Redirection to a provider endpoint"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Redirection to a provider endpoint. Microsoft Azure App Service apps redirect requests to an endpoint that signs in users for that provider. The App Service can automatically direct all unauthenticated users to the endpoint that signs in users."
  - content: "What type of Managed Service Identities can you create?"
    choices:
    - content: "Application-assigned and VM-assigned"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Application-signed and VM-signed aren't managed service identities."
    - content: "Database-assigned and unsigned"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Managed service identities don't include database-signed and unsigned identities."
    - content: "System-assigned and User-assigned"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "System-assigned, user assigned. There are two types of managed identities: A system-assigned managed identity enabled directly on an Azure service instance. When the identity is enabled, Azure creates an identity in the Azure AD tenant trusted by the subscription of the instance."
  - content: "An App Service application stores page graphics in an Azure storage account. The app needs to authenticate programmatically to the storage account, what should be configured?"
    choices:
    - content: "Create an Azure AD system user"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "A system user isn't a secure way to authenticate programmatically."
    - content: "Create a managed identity"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Create a managed identity. A managed identity is an Azure AD security principal that represents the resource (app). Managed identities can be user or system managed."
    - content: "Create an RBAC role assignment"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "RBAC wouldn't work in this situation."
  - content: "How does using managed identities for Azure resources change the way an app authenticates to Azure Key Vault?"
    choices:
    - content: "The app gets tokens from a token service instead of Azure Active Directory."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "The app gets tokens from a token service instead of Azure Active Directory. When you enable managed identity on a web app, Azure activates a separate token-granting REST service specifically for use by the app. The app will request tokens from this service instead of Azure Active Directory."
    - content: "The app uses a certificate to authenticate instead of a secret."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Application could use either item to authenticate."
    - content: "Managed identities are automatically recognized by Azure Key Vault and authenticated automatically."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Key Vault doesn't automatically authenticate any identity."
