  questions:
  - content: "The logistics team is creating an inventory database. The team needs to add a collection to store the current products. Their programmers would like to use the ProductID as the shard key.  How would this collection be created programmatically?"
    choices:
    - content: "Use the *GetCollection* function and assign *ProductID* to the *shardKey* parameter."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. *GetCollection* isn't a function in all programing languages and for those languages that have this method, there's no *shardKey* parameter."
    - content: "Use the extended database run command function with the respective customAction, collection, and shardKey parameters."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. To define the creation of a collection with a specific shardKey, the programmers would need to use extended commands."
    - content: "Use the *CreateCollection* function and assign *ProductID* to the *shardKey* parameter."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. *CreateCollection* isn't a function in all programing languages and for those languages that have this method, there's no *shardKey* parameter."
  - content: "Which of the following statements is true?"
    choices:
    - content: "Since an Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB account doesn't have a MongoDB engine, developers need to use different tools and drivers than they currently use to connect to their current MongoDB 3.2, 3.6, 4.0 and 4.2 databases."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Developers should be able to use their current drivers and tools."
    - content: "Upgrading between Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB Server versions could take several hours depending on the databases sizes."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Since all versions use the same code base, upgrading versions should incur zero downtime."
    - content: "Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB accounts benefit from automatic and transparent sharding."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. While other MongoDB offerings require to specify and manage scaling to a horizontal scaling, the Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB automatically manages all sharding and its infrastructure behinds the scenes."
  - content: "The accounting department needs a development database but would like to reduce cost since this database won't be used regularly.  Which capacity mode should the accounting team pick for the database?"
    choices:
    - content: "Provisioned."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Provisioned will be the least desirable capacity mode since there will be a charge regardless of usage."
    - content: "Autoscale."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While autoscale will allow a limit on the RUs used to be set, and would scale up to that number, it still will at least charge for the minimum RUs regardless if the RUs are used or not."
    - content: "Serverless."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. With Serverless, only operations performed are charged, and there isn't a payment for the database when it isn't used."
