  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "An Azure IoT solution uses a common message format. Which of the following statements about the common message format is accurate?"
    choices:
    - content: "The common message format enables IoT hub to interpret device-to-cloud messages that arrive unformatted."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Device-to-cloud messages must be formatted correctly for IoT hub."
    - content: "Versions of the common message format are optimized for each of the messaging protocols supported by IoT hub."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. One common message format applies to all device-facing protocols."
    - content: "The common message format is used across protocols for both device-to-cloud and cloud-to-device messages."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. IoT Hub defines a common message format for all device-facing protocols. This message format is used for both device-to-cloud routing and cloud-to-device messages."
  - content: "Within an IoT solution, under what conditions is the fallback route used?"
    choices:
    - content: "When multiple routes would have directed a message to the same custom endpoint, the fallback route is used specify which route delivers the message."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. When multiple routes direct a message to the same endpoint, IoT hub automatically delivers a single instance of the message."
    - content: "When multiple routes would have directed a message to multiple endpoints, the fallback route is used specify which endpoint the message should be delivered to."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. There is nothing wrong with messages being sent to more than one endpoint when multiple routes are defined."
    - content: "When multiple routes are defined, but a message doesn't match any query conditions, the fallback route sends the message to the built-in endpoint."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The fallback route sends all the messages that don't satisfy query conditions on any of the existing routes to the built-in endpoint."
