Websites are used for many types of purposes. You can create storefronts, allowing a company to sell products. You could provide information about an organization, such as a digital brochure. Or you might develop a fully interactive application. Because of the flexibility and pervasiveness of websites, you can create all manner of projects. The first place to start when becoming a web developer is with Hypertext Markup Language or HTML.
