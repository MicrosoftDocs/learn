The module discussed how single sign-on (SSO) is configured for various SAP environments running in ECS/RISE, similar to a natively run SAP system. It provided tutorials on Microsoft Entra ID-based SSO integration with SAP NetWeaver, SAP Fiori, and SAP HANA. The module also covered different SSO methods, their typical use cases, and implementation details. Furthermore, it explained SSO against Active Directory (AD) for ECS/RISE managed SAP environments, emphasizing that domain integration isn't necessary for SSO with AD/Kerberos.
