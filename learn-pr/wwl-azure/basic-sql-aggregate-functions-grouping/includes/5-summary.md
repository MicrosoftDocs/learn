This tutorial provided a comprehensive overview of aggregate functions and data grouping techniques in SQL, specifically in the context of PostgreSQL.
You should now be able to use functions such as `COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, `MIN`, and `MAX` to perform calculations across multiple rows, as well as organize and summarize data using the `GROUP BY` and `HAVING` clauses.

By learning these concepts, you're well-equipped to analyze trends, generate meaningful summaries and filter grouped results effectively within relational databases.
