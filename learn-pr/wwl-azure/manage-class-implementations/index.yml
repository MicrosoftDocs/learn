summary: Learn how to implement classes using specialized techniques like static classes, partial classes, and object initializers that can improve the readability, maintainability, and organization of your code.
abstract: |
  After completing this module, you'll be able to:

  -   Describe the differences between structured and object-oriented programs, the benefits of encapsulation, and the lifecycle of a class.

  -   Restrict access to classes and members using private, static, and nested classes.

  -   Improve code organization and maintainability using partial classes.

  -   Improve code readability and maintainability using methods that implement named and optional arguments.

  -   Improve code efficiency and readability using object initializers and copy constructors.

  -   Explain the purpose of a class finalizer and the relationship between a finalizer and the garbage collector in .NET.
prerequisites: |
  -   The ability to&nbsp;create classes and class constructors to instantiate objects in a C# app.

  -   The ability to&nbsp;implement class properties using&nbsp;property accessors and access modifiers and methods or extension methods that support overloading.

  -   The ability to develop C# console apps that implement business logic using iteration statements, selection statements, and custom methods.

  -   The ability to perform basic C# code debugging and exception handling in a Visual Studio Code environment.
