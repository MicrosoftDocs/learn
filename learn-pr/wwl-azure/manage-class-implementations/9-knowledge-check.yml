  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "What is the main difference between structured programming and object-oriented programming?"
    choices:
    - content: "Structured programming and object-oriented programming are essentially the same, with only minor differences in syntax and terminology."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Structured programming and object-oriented programming are two distinct approaches to software development, each with its own set of principles and methodologies."
    - content: "Structured programming focuses on the sequence of actions to be performed, while object-oriented programming emphasizes the objects involved in the actions."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. While structured programming focuses on the sequence of actions to be performed, object-oriented programming emphasizes the objects involved in the actions."
    - content: "Structured programming is based on objects that encapsulate both data and behavior, while object-oriented programming is based on a top-down approach where the program is divided into smaller, manageable functions or procedures."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This statement is reversed. Object-oriented programming is based on objects that encapsulate both data and behavior, while structured programming is based on a top-down approach where the program is divided into smaller, manageable functions or procedures."
  - content: "What is the main difference between a static class and a non-static class?"
    choices:
    - content: "A static class can't be instantiated and it contains only static members."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. A static class is essentially a non-static class that can't be instantiated and only contains static members."
    - content: "A static class can't contain static methods, fields, properties, or events."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A static class can only contain static members."
    - content: "A static class can be instantiated using the 'new' operator."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A static class can't be instantiated using the 'new' operator."
  - content: "What is the purpose of using the partial keyword in class definitions?"
    choices:
    - content: "It allows a class to inherit from multiple base classes."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. In C#, a class can't inherit from multiple base classes. The partial keyword is used to split a class definition across multiple files."
    - content: "It enables the splitting of a class definition over two or more source files."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The partial keyword allows a class definition to be split across multiple files. All parts are combined when the application is compiled."
    - content: "It makes a class abstract, meaning it can't be instantiated directly."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The partial keyword does not make a class abstract. It's used to split a class definition across multiple files."
  - content: "What happens when named and optional arguments are used in a method?"
    choices:
    - content: "The arguments are evaluated in the order in which they appear in the parameter list, not the argument list."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. When named and optional arguments are used, the arguments are evaluated in the order in which they appear in the argument list, not the parameter list."
    - content: "The arguments are evaluated in the order in which they appear in the argument list, not the parameter list, and they allow supplying arguments for selected parameters."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Named and optional arguments are evaluated in the order they appear in the argument list and they allow supplying arguments for selected parameters."
    - content: "Named and optional parameters do not allow supplying arguments for selected parameters."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Named and optional parameters enable you to supply arguments for selected parameters."
  - content: "What is the purpose of a copy constructor in C#?"
    choices:
    - content: "It allows you to create a new object by copying the values of an existing object's methods."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A copy constructor does not copy the methods of an existing object, it copies the values of an existing object's properties."
    - content: "It allows you to create a new object by copying the values of an existing object's properties."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. A copy constructor in C# creates a new object by copying the values of an existing object's properties."
    - content: "It allows you to assign values to any accessible fields or properties of an object at creation time without having to invoke a constructor followed by lines of assignment statements."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This is the definition of an object initializer, not a copy constructor."
  - content: "What is the role of a finalizer in a class in C#?"
    choices:
    - content: "Finalizers are used to allocate memory for a class instance."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Finalizers aren't used for memory allocation, but for clean-up when a class instance is being collected by the garbage collector."
    - content: "Finalizers are used to perform any necessary final clean-up when a class instance is being collected by the garbage collector."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Finalizers are used to release any unmanaged resources and perform clean-up before an object is garbage collected."
    - content: "Finalizers can be called explicitly to perform specific actions."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Finalizers can't be called explicitly. They're invoked automatically by the garbage collector."
  - content: "What is the primary purpose of implementing classes in C# applications?"
    choices:
    - content: "To increase the execution speed of the application"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While efficient code can improve execution speed, the primary purpose of classes is to encapsulate data and behavior."
    - content: "To create a visual representation of the application"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Classes aren't used for visual representation, they're used to define objects and their behavior."
    - content: "To encapsulate data and behavior into objects"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Classes in C# are used to encapsulate data and behavior into objects, providing a blueprint for creating instances or objects."
