In this module, you learned about the structure of an object-oriented program and how to implement classes using techniques that improve the quality of your applications. You learned how to improve the readability, maintainability, and organization of your code by using static classes, partial classes, nested classes, and by implementing methods that use named and optional arguments. You also learned about object initializers, copy constructors, and the relationship between a class `finalizer` and the garbage collector in .NET.

The main takeaways from this module include an improved understanding of encapsulation, access modifiers, and the techniques for implementing classes in a C# application. You learned how to implement private, static, nested, and partial classes in a C# application. You also learned about object initializers and copy constructors, methods that implement named and optional arguments, and how a class `finalizers` works with the garbage collector to release resources.
