Another type of virtual machine is the Azure Virtual Desktop. Azure Virtual Desktop is a desktop and application virtualization service that runs on the cloud. It enables you to use a cloud-hosted version of Windows from any location. Azure Virtual Desktop works across devices and operating systems, and works with apps that you can use to access remote desktops or most modern browsers.

The following video gives you an overview of Azure Virtual Desktop:

## Enhance security

Azure Virtual Desktop provides centralized security management for users' desktops with Microsoft Entra ID. You can enable multifactor authentication to secure user sign-ins. You can also secure access to data by assigning granular role-based access controls (RBACs) to users.

With Azure Virtual Desktop, the data and apps are separated from the local hardware. The actual desktop and apps are running in the cloud, meaning the risk of confidential data being left on a personal device is reduced. Additionally, user sessions are isolated in both single and multi-session environments.

## Multi-session Windows 10 or Windows 11 deployment

Azure Virtual Desktop lets you use Windows 10 or Windows 11 Enterprise multi-session, the only Windows client-based operating system that enables multiple concurrent users on a single VM. Azure Virtual Desktop also provides a more consistent experience with broader application support compared to Windows Server-based operating systems.
