Azure ExpressRoute lets you extend your on-premises networks into the Microsoft cloud. The connection is facilitated by a connectivity provider. With ExpressRoute, you can establish connections to Microsoft cloud services, such as Microsoft Azure, Microsoft 365, and CRM Online.

## Make your connections fast, reliable, and private

Use Azure ExpressRoute to create private connections between Azure datacenters and infrastructure on your premises or in a colocation environment. ExpressRoute connections don't go over the public Internet, and they offer more reliability, faster speeds, and lower latencies than typical Internet connections. In some cases, using ExpressRoute connections to transfer data between on-premises systems and Azure can give you significant cost benefits.

With ExpressRoute, establish connections to Azure at an ExpressRoute location, such as an Exchange provider facility, or directly connect to Azure from your existing WAN network, such as a multiprotocol label switching (MPLS) VPN, provided by a network service provider.

## Use a virtual private cloud for storage, backup, and recovery

ExpressRoute gives you a fast and reliable connection to Azure with bandwidths up to 100 Gbps. The high connection speeds make it excellent for scenarios like periodic data migration, replication for business continuity, and disaster recovery. ExpressRoute is a cost-effective option for transferring large amounts of data, such as datasets for high-performance computing applications, or moving large virtual machines between your dev-test environments.

## Extend and connect your datacenters

Use ExpressRoute to connect and add compute and storage capacity to your existing datacenters. With high throughput and low latencies, Azure will feel like a natural extension to or between your datacenters, so you enjoy the scale and economics of the public cloud without having to compromise on network performance.

## Build hybrid applications

Build applications that span on-premises infrastructure and Azure without compromising privacy or performance. For example, run a corporate intranet application in Azure that authenticates your customers with an on-premises Active Directory service. You serve all of your corporate customers without traffic ever routing through the public Internet.
