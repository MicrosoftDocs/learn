    choices:
    - content: "Asymmetric key pair"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. When establishing an SSH connection to a Windows node of a Kubernetes cluster, you need to provide the location of the private key of the asymmetric key pair generated during cluster provisioning."
    - content: "Active Directory"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Windows Servers that are deployed as part of a Kubernetes cluster node pool are not automatically joined to Active Directory."
