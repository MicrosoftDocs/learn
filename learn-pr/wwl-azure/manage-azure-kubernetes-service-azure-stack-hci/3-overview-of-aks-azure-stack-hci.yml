quiz:
  title: "Knowledge check"
  questions:
  - content: "You are preparing for deployment of containerized workloads by using Kubernetes on your existing Azure Stack HCI cluster that you set up for Contoso. You need to minimize the overhead associated with maintaining operating system images for the Kubernetes cluster nodes. What should you do first?"
    choices:
    - content: "Deploy the AKS cluster."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. AKS provides automated upgrades of cluster nodes to the latest available Kubernetes version."
    - content: "Register Azure Stack HCI with Azure."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This is required for any Azure Stack HCI installation and does not inherently provide automated upgrades of Kubernetes cluster nodes."
    - content: "Onboard Azure Stack HCI to Azure Arc."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Azure Arc offers a number of benefits for AKS deployments, such as support for Azure Policy and Azure RBAC, but it does not provide automated upgrades of Kubernetes cluster nodes."
