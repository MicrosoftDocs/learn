quiz:
  title: "Knowledge check"
  questions:
  - content: "Contoso is planning to deploy Windows and Linux containerized workloads into AKS on Azure Stack HCI. You need to document the procedure that would ensure that Windows-based pods are deployed to the Kubernetes cluster nodes running Windows. You decided to use taints and tolerations for this purpose. To which cluster component should you apply the taint?"
    choices:
    - content: "Pod"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Tolerations are part of pod specifications, but taints are part of node configuration."
    - content: "Node"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Taints are part of node configuration."
    - content: "Deployment"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Deployments can include tolerations as part of the pod specifications, but taints are part of node configuration."
