  title: "Knowledge check"
  questions:
  - content: "Contoso's Information Security team requests you to investigate the options for implementing AD DS-based authentication of Windows-based containerized workloads hosted by AKS on Azure Stack HCI. You start by deploying a Kubernetes cluster containing Windows Server nodes into your Azure Stack HCI cluster. What should you do next?"
    choices:
    - content: "Register the Azure Stack HCI cluster with Azure."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This is a requirement for deploying AKS on Azure Stack HCI, which you have already completed."
    - content: "Enable CredSSP in the Azure Stack HCI cluster."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This functionality does not depend in any way on CredSSP being enabled."
    - content: "Join the Kubernetes cluster Windows Server nodes to the AD DS domain."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. To provide the ability for pods to use gMSA for authentication, you must first join to an AD DS domain all of the Windows Server-based Kubernetes worker nodes that will host these pods."
