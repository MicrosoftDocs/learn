      explanation: "Correct. To implement a volume in a Kubernetes cluster, you need to first define a persistent volume claim."
    - content: "Storage class"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. AKS on Azure Stack HCI offers the default storage class, which implements VHDX-based disks."
