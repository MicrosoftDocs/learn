quiz:
  title: "Knowledge check"
  questions:
  - content: "Because Contoso developers are working on containerizing stateful workloads, you want to test the implementation of persistent pod storage by using your deployment of AKS on Azure Stack HCI. What do you have to define first?"
    choices:
    - content: "Persistent volume claim"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. To implement a volume in a Kubernetes cluster, you need to first define a persistent volume claim."
    - content: "Storage class"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. AKS on Azure Stack HCI offers the default storage class, which implements VHDX-based disks."
    - content: "Persistent volume"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Persistent volumes require you to first define a persistent volume claim."
