Continuous integration relies on four key elements for successful implementation: a Version Control System, Package Management System, Continuous Integration System, and an Automated Build Process.

A **version control system** manages changes to your source code over time.

 -  [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
 -  [Apache Subversion](https://subversion.apache.org/)
 -  [Team Foundation Version Control](/azure/devops/repos/tfvc/overview)

A **package management system** is used to install, uninstall, and manage software packages.

 -  [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/)
 -  [Node Package Manager (NPM)](https://www.npmjs.com/)
 -  [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/)
 -  [HomeBrew](https://brew.sh/)
 -  [RPM](http://rpm.org/)

A **continuous integration system** merges all developer working copies to shared mainline several times a day.

 -  [Azure DevOps](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/devops)
 -  [TeamCity](https://www.jetbrains.com/teamcity/)
 -  [Jenkins](https://jenkins.io/)

An **automated build process** creates a software build, including compiling, packaging, and running automated tests.

 -  [Apache Ant](http://ant.apache.org/)
 -  [NAnt2](https://nant2.github.io/)
 -  [Gradle](https://gradle.org/)

> [!NOTE]
> Your team needs to select the specific platforms and tools they'll use for each element. You need to ensure that you've established each pillar before proceeding.
