Microsoft Azure is more than just a means to continue business as usual. Azure also enables you to grow your business by:

 -  Scaling up your operations to new capacities.
 -  Innovating all-new products and services faster.
 -  Exploring the potential of cutting-edge technologies.

There are many ways that Azure can help grow your business, and every company will have a different growth story. Read the examples here and start imagining what your company’s story might look like.

## Business Growth in the Cloud

**Since your usage of the cloud can scale dynamically, growing your company’s operations is easy**. If your business experiences an increase in customer engagement, such as in retail during the holidays or at back-to school, you can quickly--even automatically--grow your cloud operations. If you take on a new project that requires more computing power, such as an intensive one-time data analysis, you can easily access that power. All you have to do is subscribe to more cloud capacity or set up automatic scaling to add that capacity as needed. You won’t need to wait for your IT team to install new systems to handle that growth. Azure easily accommodates it for you.

**Example**: [In this video, learn about how a six-person industrial data analysis startup, ShookIOT, reached its biggest client ever with Azure’s scalable services](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gu1BSMH0EVE).

**Example**: Read about how [Orbit Healthcare Inc](https://customers.microsoft.com/story/1508804455826129737-orbit-healthcare-professional-services-azure-migration). switched to Azure to prepare for a major new client and eliminate bottlenecks in its existing systems. Orbit used Azure’s scaling capabilities to ensure that they could handle the workload and improved their service for all of their customers.

## Agility and Time-to-Market

**Azure empowers your business to be much more agile in changing up your digital strategy and services**. When your business decides to update its software or needs to do so to adapt to a new regulation, you can make these changes quickly and without any physical hardware adjustments, saving time and money.

**This agility extends to consumer-facing efforts as well**. If your business wants to create a new digital product, build a new website, or expand into new markets, your workforce can quickly generate new digital assets using the power and reach of Azure. In this way, Azure can give your business the time-to-market competitive edge to reach customers faster than ever.

**Example**: [Watch this video to learn how Central Logic and the U.S. state of Arizona used Azure to build a responsive hospital triage system in record time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytihDQVB_uM).

**Example**: Read about how [German insurance company Munich Re](https://customers.microsoft.com/story/836291-munich-re-insurance-azure-cosmos-db) used Azure to build new services that greatly sped up the company’s ability to receive claims from physicians (from 7 days to 2) and manage those claims (from 200 days to 100). In addition, Munich Re has been able to offer new products, such as a paperless digital survey and a service that empowers insurers to easily share information.

## Innovation in the Cloud

**Azure provides the data and power your business needs to innovate all-new products and services**. With the cloud, you can collect data at massive scales and in new ways, such as with sensors at your workplaces. Anyone you want in your workforce can access that data and use cloud-based data analysis tools to unlock new insights about your business and your customers. We call this “**data democracy**.” Then, use the cloud’s computing power to experiment with new solutions based on that data. And since your IT team won’t have to worry about maintenance, you can use their skills and budget for these exciting projects instead.

**Example**: [The Co-op Group](https://customers.microsoft.com/story/1518703641748900727-coop-retailer) used Azure to create a new “Data EcoSystem” that could gather its data in one place and auto-update with in-store technology such as self-checkout kiosks. Empowered by data democracy, employees throughout the company use the data to make staffing and in-store planning decisions.

**Example**: When Covid-19 appeared, business data company UnlimitedViz used Azure services to bring language and sentiment analysis to its tyGraph product. Customers were able to use tyGraph’s capabilities to track their employees’ reactions and actions in response to the pandemic and adapt their business strategies in response. This data lift could reach up to 3 billion rows per customer, all ably handled by Azure.

## Cutting-Edge Technology

Through Azure, your business can also explore new technologies such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, and the Internet of Things. Azure offers services in all these fields, accessible to your business via subscription.

**Example**: [Watch this video about how global energy tech company Envision and its Energy Operating System EnOS use the Internet of Things to monitor and coordinate between smart energy devices](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMGNhv7Ud2o).

**Example**: [Dutch greenhouse tech company Blue Radix](https://customers.microsoft.com/story/1532065782621026828-blue-radix-professional-services-azure-automation) uses Azure Internet of Things capabilities to deliver the Crop Controller technology, which automates and optimizes climate and energy management in a greenhouse. Growers who could only maintain 10 hectares of crops before can now manage 40 or 50 hectares, with Crop Controller springing into action every five minutes, day and night.
