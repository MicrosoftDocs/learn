With Microsoft Azure, you gain access to a global computing network with over 200 datacenters located in 61 regions around the world. The worldwide reach of the cloud can improve your business in two key ways:

## Connecting Worldwide

Azure can improve the quality of your business’s digital services to worldwide customers and employees. Since Azure's cloud technology is distributed around the world, people across the globe can connect to your digital services faster via datacenters nearer to them. Your business can even choose to specifically invest in cloud assets located near your customers and worksites. Your workforce will be able to collaborate more reliably, and your customers will enjoy better service. And if you don’t yet have a worldwide presence, the cloud might help change that!

## Legal Compliance

Another benefit of Azure’s global reach is that Azure can be configured to meet regulatory requirements across the globe. Whether you have local, regional, or national regulatory requirements, Azure can likely be configured to meet those requirements. For example, if you do business in the European Union (EU), then you can arrange to have European customers’ cloud data stored at a datacenter in Europe. Your other customers’ data can be stored elsewhere, compliant with other regulations as needed.

Azure has compliance offerings available for specific countries, regions, and industries. For more information about legal compliance, check out the [Trust Center](https://www.microsoft.com/trust-center/compliance/regional-country-compliance?azure-portal=true).
