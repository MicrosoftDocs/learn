## Key takeaways

 -  With Azure, Microsoft assumes responsibility for the physical computing equipment behind your operation. You’ll no longer have the **capital expenditures** of purchasing and maintenance to worry about.
 -  Under the **operational expenditures** paradigm of cloud economics, you only need to pay for what you do in the cloud. There are no permanent capital investments, and it’s easy to quickly change your subscriptions to various Azure services.
 -  **Business operations across many departments can be made faster and more cost-efficient** with ready-to-use software optimized for the cloud. This software can come in industry-specific bundles to get your business up and running quickly with integrated software.
 -  **Your cloud operations can scale dynamically** to the size of your projects and consumer demand. You can temporarily pay extra for an intensive project or scale down your investments during off-peak seasons.
 -  **Greater reliability and uptime** mean less money lost from outages.

## Cloud Story: Homepoint

For an example of a company that reaped the cost benefits of the cloud, consider the U.S. mortgage company, Homepoint, which exceeded its savings expectations when it switched to Azure in the early 2020s:

 -  In 2020, Homepoint closed a record $62 billion in mortgages, and nearly that much again in the first six months of 2021.
 -  Monthly costs fell by $800,000 and efficiency rose 20 percent, significantly exceeding expectations. Homepoint attributed the savings to the fact that “our systems tell the agents exactly what they need to look at instead of having them ‘stare and compare’ for hours.”
 -  Azure enabled real-time insights into customer data, an improvement from four-hour “snapshots” under the old system. “As a result, we can answer much more sophisticated questions about our clients and the data they continuously feed us.”
 -  Homepoint's pace of new digital releases increased by up to 40 percent.
