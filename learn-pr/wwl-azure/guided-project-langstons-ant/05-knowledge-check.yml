  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "What is the main benefit of using interfaces as types in C#?"
    choices:
    - content: "It allows you to create a new instance of an interface."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Interfaces can't be instantiated, they can only be implemented."
    - content: "It allows objects of different types to be treated uniformly."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Using interfaces as types allows objects of different types to be treated uniformly, promoting flexibility in your code."
    - content: "It allows you to create tightly coupled code."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Using interfaces as a type promotes loosely coupled code."
  - content: "Which keyword in C# is used to check if an object is compatible with a certain interface?"
    choices:
    - content: "cast"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The cast keyword is used to convert an object to a different type."
    - content: "new"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The new keyword is used to create a new instance of a class."
    - content: "is"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The is keyword in C# is used to check if an object is compatible with a certain type or interface."
  - content: "Which SOLID principle encourages classes to be open for extension but closed for modification?"
    choices:
    - content: "Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The Single Responsibility Principle states that a class should have only one reason to change."
    - content: "Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The Liskov Substitution Principle states that a derived class should be substitutable for its base class."
    - content: "Open/Closed Principle (OCP)"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The Open/Closed Principle states that a class should be open for extension but closed for modification."
