Langston's Ant is a simulation of an ant walking along a grid. The ant follows a set of simple rules: it turns right if it's on a white square, and left if it's on a black square. Each time the ant moves to a new square, the square color changes from either black to white, or white to black. As the ant continues moving, it creates a pattern that slowly becomes more complex and interesting to observe. This simulation demonstrates how simple rules can create complex behaviors.

This module guides you through the steps required to develop your own Langston's Ant project. Your code will use interfaces to represent the functions the ants can perform. By the end of this module, your project will be able to display two ants creating a mirrored pattern.
