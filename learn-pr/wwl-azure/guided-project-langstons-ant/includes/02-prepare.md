You use Visual Studio to develop a Langston's Ant project. 

## Project overview

In this project, you'll apply what you learned about interfaces to abstract the Ant's behavior. Afterwards, you'll implement the new interface and create a new type of Ant as well.

## Setup

Use the following steps to prepare for the Guided Project exercises:

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You must have .NET Framework 8.0 installed and a Github account to complete these steps.

> [!NOTE] 
> If you completed previous modules in this Learning Path, you can skip these steps. Instead, close any open files and expand the **M04-Guided-Project** folder.

1. Open Visual Studio Code.

    You can use the Windows Start menu (or equivalent resource for another OS) to open Visual Studio Code.

1. Under the Visual Studio Code **Start** section, select **Clone Git Repository**.

1. In the URL bar, enter `https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/MSLearn-Implement-interfaces-in-CSharp`

1. In the File Explorer, create a new folder in a location that is easy to find and remember, such as a folder in your Desktop.

1. Click the **Select as Repository Destination** button.

    You need to be signed in to GitHub to successfully clone the project.

1. Open the project in Visual Studio Code

1. In Explorer, right-click the **M04-Guided-Project** folder and click **Open in Integrated Terminal**

1. Expand the **M04-Guided-Project** folder.

    You should see a "Game" folder and "Program.cs" file.

> [!NOTE] 
> If you get stuck, the solution for this module is available in **Solution-Guided-Project**

You're now ready to begin the Guided Project exercises. Good luck!
