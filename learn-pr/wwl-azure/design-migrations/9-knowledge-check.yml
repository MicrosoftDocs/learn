    - content: "Azure Data Box"
      isCorrect: false

      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Azure Database Migration Service handles database migrations only, not full workload discovery and assessment."

    choices:

      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The rebuild strategy rewrites the application."

      explanation: "Incorrect. The replace strategy uses SaaS alternatives rather than migrating the existing workload."
    - content: "Rehost"

  - content: "Which tool should you use when you need to transfer large amounts of data to Azure but your network bandwidth is limited?"
    choices:
    - content: "Azure Migrate"
      isCorrect: false

    - content: "Azure Data Box"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Azure Data Box is ideal when network capacity is insufficient for online migration."
    - content: "App Service Migration Assistant"
