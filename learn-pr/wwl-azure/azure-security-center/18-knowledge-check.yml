    choices:
    - content: "Monitor IoT hubs and resources"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "You can monitor IoT hubs with Microsoft Defender for Cloud free tier."
    - content: "Monitor network access and endpoint security"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Verifying endpoint and network access is part of Microsoft Defender for Cloud free tier."
    - content: "Monitor non-Azure resources"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Monitor non-Azure resources. The Microsoft Defender for Cloud free tier doesn't support monitoring external cloud or non-Azure resources, JIT VM access, compliance reports, adaptive network hardening, and several other features."
  - content: "An organization compliance group requires client authentication using Azure AD and Key Vault diagnostic logs. What is the easiest way to implement the requirement for client authentication?"
    choices:
    - content: "Configure management groups"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "A management group isn't a good choice for this requirement."
    - content: "Implement Microsoft Defender for Cloud policies"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Implement Microsoft Defender for Cloud policies. Microsoft Defender for Cloud can monitor policy compliance across all your subscriptions using a default set of security policies. A security policy defines the set of recommended controls for resources within the specified subscription or resource group."
    - content: "Create Desired Configuration State scripts"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Desired state scripts aren't the easiest way to accomplish this task."
  - content: "The Microsoft Defender for Cloud dashboard presents a Secure Score. What is the description of secure score?"
    choices:
    - content: "The Secure Score is a calculation based on the ratio of healthy resources vs. total resources."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "The Secure Score is a calculation based on the ratio of healthy resources vs. total resources. Microsoft Defender for Cloud reviews your security recommendations across all workloads, uses algorithms to determine how critical each recommendation is, and calculates a Secure Score which is displayed on the Overview page."
    - content: "The Secure Score is a count of recommendations made against your monitored resources."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "There is way more to secure score than just a count of recommendations."
    - content: "The Secure Score is a machine-learning based prediction of how likely your resources are to be infiltrated by a hacker."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Secure Score is not a track of how likely a success hacker attack will be."
  - content: "An organization is working with an outside agency that needs to access a virtual machine. There's a real concern about brute-force login attacks targeted at virtual machine management ports. Which of the following components would open the management ports for a defined time range? Select one."
    choices:
    - content: "Azure Firewall"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "A firewall wouldn't block the brute force attack, if using a valid port."
    - content: "Bastion service"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Bastion isn't the right choice for blocking brute force attacks on a VM."
    - content: "Just-in-Time virtual machine access"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "When just-in-time access is enabled, Microsoft Defender for Cloud uses network security group rules to restrict access to management ports when they aren't in use. Protected ports are the SSH and RDP ports."
  - content: "When using Microsoft Defender for Cloud to provide visibility into virtual machine security settings, the monitoring system will notify administrators as issues arise. Which incident below would require a different monitoring tool to discover it?"
    choices:
    - content: "A newer operating system version is available."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Microsoft Defender for Cloud doesn't identify newly released operating systems. Microsoft Defender for Cloud examines OS-level settings using a monitor service installed into each Windows and Linux VM. Microsoft Defender for Cloud can also provide a vulnerability assessment with remediation recommendations."
    - content: "System security updates and critical updates that are missing."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Tracking critical updates is an available notification."
    - content: "Disk encryption is applied on virtual machines."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Microsoft Defender for Cloud provides notification of missing disk encryption on virtual machines."
