      choices:
        - content: "To promote manual operational practices."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. Traditional operational practices are frequently based on an outdated, largely manual approach, which is inherently slow and vulnerable to human errors."
        - content: "To unite people, processes, and technologies to enhance cross-team synergies and optimize software delivery."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct. DevOps promotes coordination and collaboration between traditionally siloed roles, spanning such areas as development, operations, quality engineering, and security."
        - content: "To separate development and operational teams."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. This approach leads to inefficiencies and clashes between different parts of the internal IT organization."
    - content: "What is the main goal of DevOps culture?"

      choices:
        - content: "To manually test and build artifacts in small increments."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. Continuous integration (CI) during the development phase involves applying changes in small increments through automated testing and build."
        - content: "To manually test and build artifacts in large increments."
