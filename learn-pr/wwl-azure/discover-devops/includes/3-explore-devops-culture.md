DevOps extends beyond technology, tools, and processes, forming an organizational culture. In the software-development company example, it becomes crucial to start by focusing on less tangible components of organizational life, such as team collaboration, shared responsibility, empowerment, continuous learning, and agile mindset. Here, use this context to examine DevOps culture and its key elements.

## What is DevOps culture?

DevOps culture encompasses the human and organizational factors that impact software development and delivery. As such, DevOps represents a culture that promotes collaboration, communication, and shared responsibility among all organizational stakeholders.
The DevOps culture creates a collaborative, transparent, and continuously improving environment where teams work together to deliver high-quality software in an efficient and reliable manner. It involves a shift in mindset and behaviors, fostering a culture of trust, communication, and shared responsibility.

Measurable outcomes  serve as an essential component of data-driven decision making and continuous learning.
- **Customer-centric focus:** DevOps values the customer's experience and emphasizes accelerated and reliable software delivery.
- **Agility:** DevOps organizations are adaptable and responsive to change, embracing an agile mindset.
- **Automation:** Automation increases efficiency, reduces errors, and accelerates development and deployment processes in DevOps.
- **Security Integration:** Security is an essential part of DevOps, permeating throughout each stage, which hints for the reason behind coining the term DevSecOps. DevSecOps is an extension of DevOps, with the focus on integrating security practices into the DevOps processes.
