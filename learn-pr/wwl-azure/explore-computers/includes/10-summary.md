In this module, you explored the basic parts of a computer. While there are various types of computers like phones and laptops, all computers share these basic parts. Computers have changed a lot since they first were invented but, in some ways, they haven't changed all that much. They still operate on the basic principles they started out with.

This module explored the following:

 -  The basics of what is in a computer. You saw what a computer must have and what computers do have.
 -  The "brains" of the computer. The processor does all the thinking.
 -  Short- and long-term memory. RAM is used for short-term computing and storage saves stuff for later.
 -  How computers talk to each other. Networks are groups of computers that can send data back and forth.
 -  How data centers and the cloud make computers more powerful.

This exploration provides insight into how all computers work at some level. While computers are as different as the people who use them, hopefully you now have a better understanding of how all of them work.
