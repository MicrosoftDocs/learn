  title: "Check Your Knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "What is the main difference between the CPU and the GPU?"
    choices:
    - content: "The CPU handles digital data."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Both the GPU and the CPU handle digital data."
    - content: "The GPU mainly stores information."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Neither the CPU nor the GPU is used for storage."
    - content: "The GPU is faster."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. The GPU is different from the CPU because it can \"think\" faster."
  - content: "Why do computers have random access memory (RAM)?"
    choices:
    - content: "To store information even when the computer is off"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The disk drive, not RAM, is used to store information for long periods even when the computer is off."
    - content: "To keep the computer secure"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. While RAM can prevent data from being read, its main purpose is to temporarily store data so the \"brains\" can process information."
    - content: "To store chunks of data for the CPU to use"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. RAM is used to store chunks of data that the CPU can grab and use when it needs it and temporarily store it when it doesn't."
  - content: "What enables a computer to talk to other computers on a network?"
    choices:
    - content: "The hard disk drive"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The hard disk drive stores information for later use by the brains of the computer."
    - content: "The central processing unit"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The central processing unit, or brains of the computer, mainly processes data."
    - content: "The network adapter"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. The network adapter sends data to and from other computers."
