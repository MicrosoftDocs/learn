In this module, learn how to configure Domain Name System (DNS) for Windows Server Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) virtual machines (VMs), select the appropriate DNS solution for your organization’s needs, and run a DNS server in a Windows Server Azure IaaS VM.

## Scenario

Contoso is a medium-size financial services company in London with a branch office in New York. Most of its compute environment runs on-premises on Windows Server. This includes virtualized workloads on Windows Server 2016 hosts. Contoso IT staff are in the process of migrating Contoso servers to Windows Server 2025.

Contoso’s IT director realizes that Contoso has an outdated operational model with limited automation and reliance on dated technology. The Contoso IT Engineering team has started exploring Azure capabilities. They want to determine whether Azure services might assist with modernizing the current operational model through automation and virtualization.

As part of the initial design, the Contoso IT team asked you, their lead system engineer and server administrator, to set up a proof of concept environment. This environment must verify whether Azure services can help to modernize the IT infrastructure and meet business goals.

Name resolution is a critical part of any network. Contoso currently maintains an on-premises DNS solution to manage name resolution. It's important that any Azure networking components can provide the necessary name resolution elements.

In this module, learn how to implement DNS in Azure, choose an appropriate DNS solution for Azure IaaS VMs, and configure split-horizon DNS. Also learn how to troubleshoot DNS.
