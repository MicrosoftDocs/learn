  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "Reviewers notice the term “cloud gateway” listed on the architecture diagram for an IoT solution. What is the primary purpose of the cloud gateway?"
    choices:
    - content: "It facilitates the execution of actions based on insights garnered from device telemetry data during stream processing."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A cloud gateway can filter and route device messages, but does implement actions based or generate insights based on device data."
    - content: "It provides secure connectivity, telemetry and event ingestion, and device management capabilities."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. A cloud gateway, such as Azure IoT Hub, enables secure device connections and two-way communications that enable data ingestion and device management."
    - content: "It provides immediate and long-term access to telemetry data."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A cloud gateway can stream data to other cloud resources for analysis and storage, but does not itself provide long-term storage capabilities."
  - content: "Security is an important consideration and should be included on the architecture diagram for an IoT solution. Where should security be referenced on the architecture diagram?"
    choices:
    - content: "Security is associated primarily with communication between the Cloud Gateway and the other services/devices and should appear next to Cloud Gateway on the diagram."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Security considerations include device communications, but are not limited to this one area of the architecture diagram."
    - content: "Security is associated with all subsystems of the solution and should appear across the top of the diagram."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Security is a cross-cutting concern that is listed at the top of the diagram and applies to physical devices, cloud resources, and communication at each level."
    - content: "Security is associated primarily with cloud services and should appear on the cloud side of the diagram."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Security considerations include the cloud services implemented within a solution, but are not limited to this one area of the architecture diagram."
