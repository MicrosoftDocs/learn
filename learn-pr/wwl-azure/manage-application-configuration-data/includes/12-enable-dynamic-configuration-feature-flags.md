**Estimated time:** 60 minutes.

**Lab files:** none.

## Scenario

[Azure App Configuration](/azure/azure-app-configuration/overview) provides a service to manage application settings and feature flags centrally. Modern programs, especially those running in a cloud, generally have many distributed components. Spreading configuration settings across these components can lead to hard-to-troubleshoot errors during application deployment. Use App Configuration to store all the settings for your application and secure their accesses in one place.

## Objectives

After completing this lab, you'll be able to:

 -  Enable dynamic configuration.
 -  Manage feature flags.

## Requirements

 -  This lab requires **Microsoft Edge** or an [Azure DevOps-supported browser](/azure/devops/server/compatibility).
 -  **Set up an Azure DevOps organization:** If you don't already have an Azure DevOps organization that you can use for this lab, create one by following the instructions available at [Create an organization or project collection](/azure/devops/organizations/accounts/create-organization).
 -  Identify an existing Azure subscription or create a new one.
 -  Verify that you have a Microsoft or Azure AD account with the Contributor or the Owner role in the Azure subscription. For details, refer to [List Azure role assignments using the Azure portal](/azure/active-directory/roles/manage-roles-portal) and [View and assign administrator roles in Azure Active Directory](/azure/active-directory/roles/manage-roles-portal).

## Exercises

During this lab, you'll complete the following exercises:

 -  Exercise 0: Configure the lab prerequisites.
 -  Exercise 1: Import and run CI/CD Pipelines.
 -  Exercise 2: Manage Azure App Configuration.
