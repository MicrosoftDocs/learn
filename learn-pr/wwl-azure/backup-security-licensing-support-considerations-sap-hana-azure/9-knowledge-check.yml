  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "Which of the following is a disadvantage of the storage snapshot backup method for SAP HANA on Azure (Large Instances)?"
    choices:
    - content: "Long backup and recovery times"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The storage snapshot method is included with HANA Large Instances. It is optimized for disaster recovery for HANA Large Instances, and offers boot volume backup support, but there is a limit of 254 snapshots per volume."
    - content: "Maximum of 254 snapshots per volume"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The storage snapshot method is included with HANA Large Instances. It is optimized for disaster recovery for HANA Large Instances, and offers boot volume backup support, but there is a limit of 254 snapshots per volume."
    - content: "High storage space requirement"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The storage snapshot method is included with HANA Large Instances. It is optimized for disaster recovery for HANA Large Instances, and offers boot volume backup support, but there is a limit of 254 snapshots per volume."
  - content: "Which method of triggering an SAP HANA on Azure (Large Instances) storage snapshot does not require an SAP HANA snapshot first?"
    choices:
    - content: "Triggered over /hana/data"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This method does require an SAP HANA snapshot first."
    - content: "Triggered over /hana/shared (which includes /usr/sap)"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This method does require an SAP HANA snapshot first."
    - content: "Triggered over /hana/logbackups"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Transaction log backups are taken frequently and stored in the /hana/logbackups volume or in Azure. You can trigger the /hana/logbackups volume that contains the transaction log backups to take a snapshot separately. In that case, you don't need to run an SAP HANA snapshot."
  - content: "What tends to happen to the storage space required for an SAP HANA on Azure (Large Instances) storage snapshot over time?"
    choices:
    - content: "It tends to increase"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. As data content changes and the content in SAP HANA data files change on the storage volume, the snapshot needs to store the original block content and the data changes. As a result, the storage snapshot increases in size. The longer the snapshot exists, the larger the storage snapshot becomes."
    - content: "It tends to decrease"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. As data content changes and the content in SAP HANA data files change on the storage volume, the snapshot needs to store the original block content and the data changes. As a result, the storage snapshot increases in size. The longer the snapshot exists, the larger the storage snapshot becomes."
    - content: "It remains the same"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. As data content changes and the content in SAP HANA data files change on the storage volume, the snapshot needs to store the original block content and the data changes. As a result, the storage snapshot increases in size. The longer the snapshot exists, the larger the storage snapshot becomes."
  - content: "By default, what form of encryption is used for data transferred between HANA Large Instance and VMs?"
    choices:
    - content: "Transparent Data Encryption (TDE)"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Data transferred between HANA Large Instance and VMs are not encrypted. As an alternative, you have the option of enabling application-level encryption between the HANA DBMS and JDBC/ODBC-based applications."
    - content: "Azure Storage Service Encryption (SSE)"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Data transferred between HANA Large Instance and VMs are not encrypted. As an alternative, you have the option of enabling application-level encryption between the HANA DBMS and JDBC/ODBC-based applications."
    - content: "The data is not encrypted in transit"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Data transferred between HANA Large Instance and VMs are not encrypted. As an alternative, you have the option of enabling application-level encryption between the HANA DBMS and JDBC/ODBC-based applications."
  - content: "What is the minimum level of Microsoft support contract required for deployment of SAP HANA on Azure (Large Instances)?"
    choices:
    - content: "Microsoft Premier support"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Deployment of SAP HANA on Azure (Large Instances) requires a Microsoft Premier support contract."
    - content: "Microsoft Standard support"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Deployment of SAP HANA on Azure (Large Instances) requires a Microsoft Premier support contract."
    - content: "No support contract is required"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Deployment of SAP HANA on Azure (Large Instances) requires a Microsoft Premier support contract."
