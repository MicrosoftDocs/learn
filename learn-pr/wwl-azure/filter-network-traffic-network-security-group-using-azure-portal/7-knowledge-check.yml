  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "What is the purpose of a network security group in Azure?"
    choices:
    - content: "Enables the creation of virtual machines in Azure"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A network security group doesn't enable the creation of virtual machines in Azure."
    - content: "Provides storage for Azure resources"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A network security group doesn't provide storage for Azure resources."
    - content: "Enables the automation and validation of the creation and teardown of environments to help deliver secure and stable application hosting platforms"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. A network security group is used to filter inbound and outbound network traffic to and from Azure resources in an Azure virtual network, helping to deliver secure and stable application hosting platforms."
  - content: "What happens to network traffic that doesn't match any NSG rules?"
    choices:
    - content: "It's allowed by default"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Allowing traffic by default would pose a security risk."
    - content: "It's denied by default"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. By default, network traffic that doesn't match any Network Security Group (NSG) rules is denied. This ensures that any traffic not explicitly allowed is blocked and helps maintain a secure network environment."
    - content: "It's logged for analysis"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. NSGs don't log traffic by default, but logging can be enabled for further analysis."
  - content: "How do Application Security Groups (ASGs) enhance network security within Azure Virtual Networks?"
    choices:
    - content: "By grouping virtual machines according to their functions to streamline network security rules application."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct because ASGs allow administrators to group VMs based on their roles or functions, enabling more efficient and targeted security rule application, thus improving overall security posture and management efficiency."
    - content: "By encrypting virtual network traffic"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect because ASGs don't encrypt network traffic; encryption is managed through other mechanisms like Azure VPN Gateway or Azure ExpressRoute for securing network traffic."
    - content: "By automatically applying antivirus software to all virtual machines within a group"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect because ASGs don't deal with antivirus software; their purpose is to simplify network security management by grouping VMs for security rule application."
  - content: "A network administrator is planning to minimize the number of security rules and changes needed. They are considering using service tags or application security groups, rather than individual IP addresses or ranges of IP addresses. What should they ensure about the network interfaces in both application security groups?"
    choices:
    - content: "They must exist in different virtual networks"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Having network interfaces in different virtual networks would make it impossible to assign one as the source and the other as the destination in a rule."
    - content: "They can exist in any virtual network"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The network interfaces need to be in the same virtual network for both the source and destination application security groups."
    - content: "They must exist in the same virtual network"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. All network interfaces for both the source and destination application security groups need to exist in the same virtual network."
