Network security groups provide essential network traffic filtering capabilities for Azure resources. In this module, you learned how to implement and manage NSGs to protect your cloud infrastructure.

## Key concepts covered

You now understand how to:

- Create and configure network security groups with custom security rules
- Define rules based on source, destination, port, and protocol to control traffic flow
- Apply NSGs at the subnet or network interface level for flexible security policies
- Use application security groups to simplify security management for multi-tier applications
- Understand how Azure evaluates rules using priority and the five-tuple matching system
- Apply default security rules and override them when necessary
- Troubleshoot network connectivity using effective security rules and IP flow verify
