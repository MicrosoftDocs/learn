summary: In this module, we will focus on filtering network traffic using Network Security Groups (NSGs) in the Azure portal. Learn how to create, configure, and apply NSGs for improved network security.
abstract: |
  By the end of this training module, participants will:

  -   Understand the purpose and benefits of using Azure NSG to filter network traffic.

  -   Learn how to create and configure NSGs to enforce access controls for Azure resources.

  -   Gain insights into how NSGs can be used to allow or deny specific types of traffic based on source, destination, and port.

  -   Understand how to prioritize NSG rules and leverage Azure NSG flow logs for monitoring and troubleshooting.

  -   Recognize the role of NSGs in implementing network security best practices in Azure.
