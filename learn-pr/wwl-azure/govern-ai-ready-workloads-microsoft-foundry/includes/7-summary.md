You established comprehensive governance controls for AI infrastructure using Microsoft Foundry. Starting with the policy framework, you configured enforcement rules that prevent noncompliant deployments before they reach production—reducing security vulnerabilities by 60% compared to reactive monitoring approaches. The policy hierarchy you implemented cascades organizational standards from management groups through subscriptions to resource groups, ensuring consistent governance across your entire Azure environment.

Building on that foundation, you implemented identity and access management strategies that protect AI resources through multiple layers. Microsoft Entra ID integration provides centralized authentication, while role-based access control ensures users and services receive only the permissions their job functions require. Managed identities eliminated credential management overhead for service-to-service authentication, and conditional access policies add context-aware security that adapts to risk levels during sensitive operations.

The monitoring and compliance workflows you established complete the governance framework by providing continuous visibility into AI operations. Azure Monitor captures telemetry automatically from every AI resource, alert rules trigger automated responses when violations occur, and compliance dashboards aggregate evidence for regulatory reviews. With audit logs retained for seven years, your security team can conduct forensic analysis of incidents while demonstrating compliance with auditors.

## Key takeaways

- Policy-driven governance enforces organizational standards at deployment time, preventing violations rather than detecting them after the fact
- Role-based access control combined with managed identities reduces administrative overhead by 70% while eliminating credential leakage risks
- Automated monitoring workflows reduce mean time to resolution by 60% through evaluate-decide-act patterns that respond to violations without manual intervention
- Centralized compliance dashboards aggregate telemetry from multiple sources, generating audit-ready reports that satisfy regulatory requirements
