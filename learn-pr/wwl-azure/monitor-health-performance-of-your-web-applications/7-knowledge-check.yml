  title: "Check your knowledge on Custom Domain Names"
  questions:
  - content: "If a developer wanted to test their application under specific conditions with specific data, how might they best use Application Insights to get test results for this scenario?"
    choices:
    - content: "Examine page views and load performance sent from user's browsers"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This may provide general insights across scenarios but lacks the control for a specific test."
    - content: "Enable performance counters such as CPU, memory, and network usage on server machines"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This data shows how the machines are performing but doesn't create the conditions needed to perform a specific test."
    - content: "Set up web test that sends synthetic requests to the web service"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Alias records enable a zone apex domain to reference other Azure resources from the DNS zone"
  - content: "Log Analytics is used to collect data on an application, and a query has been created to gather the specific data. How can the data be visualized to prepare for a presentation?"
    choices:
    - content: "Use Kusto to create a chart and visually represent the data"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Kusto is a query language used to query the data but can't be used for visuals."
    - content: "Use PowerShell to generate an image of the data"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. PowerShell can be used with a query to retrieve log data from Azure Monitor but other tools are needed to visualize the data."
    - content: "Use View Designer to create a visual of the data"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. View Designer provides tools to construct simple visuals of the data. Data can also be exported to Excel or Power BI for more robust visuals."
  - content: "A user of an application gives feedback that nothing happens when they select a button. A developer checks the code and doesn't see an issue. They need to determine if a code block is being hit on the button select event under various conditions. Which feature of Snapshot Debugger might best assist them in this scenario?"
    choices:
    - content: "Setting a condition in Snapshot Debugger to alter the course of code execution"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Conditions can be used to add addition logic to code execution for debugging purposes but won't help determine if a code block has executed."
    - content: "Setting a breakpoint on the event to examine what happens when it's fired"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Snapshot debugger doesn't support breakpoints. With Snapshot Debugger, you can view moments in time output from your code."
    - content: "Using a logpoint to output a log entry when the block is entered"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Logpoints can be used to add additional log entries to running code. A log entry can be used to determine if a certain block of code is being run."
