In modern DevOps environments, applications are deployed multiple times per day across complex hybrid infrastructures. When issues occur in production, they impact users immediately and require rapid resolution. Traditional manual investigation methods cannot keep pace with this velocity.

**The challenge of modern application monitoring:** As organizations adopt DevOps practices, the speed of change accelerates dramatically. Development teams release new features and updates constantly, sometimes multiple times per day. This rapid deployment cycle creates a challenging environment for maintaining application health and user experience.

**Why traditional approaches fail:** When problems arise in production, they often manifest as symptoms scattered across multiple layers of the application stack. The root cause might be in the code, the database, network infrastructure, or external dependencies. Traditional troubleshooting requires examining thousands or millions of log entries manually, a process that can take hours or days when you only have minutes to respond.

**The cost of delayed resolution:** Every minute an application issue remains unresolved affects real users and business outcomes. Customers abandon transactions, support calls increase, and brand reputation suffers. DevOps teams need automated analytics processes that can identify problems instantly and guide them to root causes without manual log analysis.

**What you'll learn:** This module teaches you to design automated analytics processes that help DevOps teams respond to incidents rapidly. You'll explore how augmented search technologies can surface critical issues from massive log volumes, how telemetry data provides continuous visibility into application health, and how modern monitoring tools integrate across your entire DevOps lifecycle.

## Learning objectives

After completing this module, you'll be able to:

- Design automated application analytics processes using Azure Application Insights.
- Implement augmented search strategies for rapid incident response.
- Integrate telemetry data collection across applications and infrastructure.
- Select monitoring tools with advanced capabilities for continuous monitoring.
- Connect ITSM tools with Azure monitoring services.

## Prerequisites

- Understanding of DevOps concepts and practices.
- Familiarity with cloud application architectures.
- Basic knowledge of application deployment and operations.
- Experience with software development or IT operations is beneficial.
