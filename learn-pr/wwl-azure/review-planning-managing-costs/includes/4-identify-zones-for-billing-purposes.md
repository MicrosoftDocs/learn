Billing zones help determine the cost of services you are using.

[Bandwidth](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/bandwidth?azure-portal=true) refers to data moving in and out of Azure datacenters. Some inbound data transfers, such as data going into Azure datacenters, are free. For outbound data transfers, such as data going out of Azure datacenters, data transfer pricing is based on **Zones**.

A Zone is a geographical grouping of Azure Regions for billing purposes. The following Zones exist and include the sample regions as listed below:

+ **Zone 1** – West US, East US, Canada West, West Europe, France Central and others

+ **Zone 2** – Australia Central, Japan West, Central India, Korea South and others

+ **Zone 3** - Brazil South

+ **DE Zone 1** - Germany Central, Germany Northeast

> * To avoid confusion, be aware that a *Zone for billing purposes* is not the same as an *Availability Zone*. In Azure, the term *Zone* is for billing purposes only, and the full-term *Availability Zone* refers to the failure protection that Azure provides for datacenters.
