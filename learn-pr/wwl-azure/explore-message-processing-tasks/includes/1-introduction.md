Real-world IoT solutions use a combination of message processing techniques, including IoT Hub message routing and Azure Stream Analytics.

Suppose you have joined a team that is implementing an Azure IoT solution for the company. Your team will need to configure a solution that is capable of processing and analyzing sensor telemetry using both Azure IoT Hub message routing and Azure Stream Analytics jobs. You decide to gain experience implementing the two service technologies in a test environment.

In this module, you will complete a lab that includes the following activities:

 -  Connect a simulated device to Azure IoT Hub and verify that IoT Hub is receiving telemetry.
 -  Configure an Azure IoT Hub message route that outputs selected message data to Azure Blob storage.
 -  Configure an Azure Stream Analytics job that analyzes message data and routes the selected information to Azure Blob storage.

By the end of this module, you will be able to implement IoT Hub message routing and Azure Stream Analytics in an IoT solution.
