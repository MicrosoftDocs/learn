As you continue your journey of sharing your knowledge with others, it is imperative to set expectations for everyone when approaching and preparing to teach Microsoft curriculum and leveraging the teaching materials. The ARB courses go beyond foundation-level skills and into associate-level skills related to Microsoft Azure or associated products. As your students begin your class, you may be asked the following types of questions: 

- Who is the audience for the Microsoft ARB courses? Students who have already taken the Microsoft Azure Fundamentals course or other Fundamentals courses. The students need foundational skills before they take the ARB courses.

- What are the prerequisites for this Microsoft ARB course? Students should have a good, solid understanding of Azure. They need to understand principals like infrastructure as a service (IaaS), platform as a service (PaaS), and software as a service (SaaS), as well as a basic understanding of resources and how those resources might be built into Azure.

- Are there hands-on labs? Yes, hands-on labs are associated with each module. We want the students to be able to do the things we’re talking about in each module and learn “how do I” knowledge. 

- What is the goal of the Microsoft ARB courses? We want to teach the students not just the “what” but “how” to do things in Microsoft Azure so they can successfully achieve the corresponding certification exam. We want to build their skills so that they're able to do the things they're learning in a real-world environment instead of just talking about what they’ve learned.
