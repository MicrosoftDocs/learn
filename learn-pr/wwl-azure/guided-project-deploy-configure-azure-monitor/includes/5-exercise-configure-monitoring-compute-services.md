This guided project consists of the four exercises:

- Exercise 1: Deploy Log Analytics
- Exercise 2: Monitor web apps
- **Exercise 3: Configure monitoring for compute services**
- Exercise 4: Configure alerts

In Exercise 3, you configure monitoring for compute services and perform tasks related to integrating IaaS virtual machines with Azure Monitor.
You create a data collection endpoint and a data collection rule to collect Windows Event logs. You then add an existing IIS log collection to the data collection rule. Finally, you configure Network Connection Monitor for a Linux IaaS virtual machine.

- Task 1: Create a data collection endpoint.
- Task 2: Create a data collection rule.
- Task 3: Add an IIS log collection to an existing data collection rule.
- Task 4: Configure Network Connection Monitor for a Linux IaaS virtual machine.
