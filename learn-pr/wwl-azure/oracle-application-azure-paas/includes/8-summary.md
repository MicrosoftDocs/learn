In this module, you took on the role of an administrator responsible for recommending how to move a custom Oracle-powered application from an on-premises datacenter to the cloud.

You learned about the advantages of PaaS services and the planning and preparation you need to perform this type of migration. You explored the process of migrating your database to Azure SQL Managed Instance and updating your application code to use the new service. You then walked through the process of migrating your data and applications to Azure. Finally, you learned about some of the management and cost considerations as you prepare for long-term success. 

You should now be able to:

- Describe how Azure PaaS can help you enhance your database workload scalability and flexibility, reduce the complexity of your management work, and take advantage of unique cloud native capabilities.
- Identify when this approach is appropriate and how to plan for it.
- Describe the migration process for your databases and applications.
