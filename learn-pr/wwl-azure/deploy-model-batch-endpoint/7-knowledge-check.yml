  questions:
  - content: "You are creating a batch endpoint that you want to use to predict new values for a large volume of data files. You want the pipeline to run the scoring script on multiple nodes and collate the results. What output action should you choose for the deployment?"
    choices:
    - content: "`summary_only`"
      isCorrect: false

    choices:
    - content: "The latest version of the deployed model."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The default deployment will be used to do the actual batch scoring when the endpoint is invoked."
