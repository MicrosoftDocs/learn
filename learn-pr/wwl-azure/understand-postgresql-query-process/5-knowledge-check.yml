  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "What are the four main query processing components in PostgreSQL?"
    choices:
    - content: "Parser, Planner, Executor, Rewriter."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. PostgreSQL queries go through the following components (in order): Parsing, Rewriter (transformation), Planning, Execution."
    - content: "Lexer, scan, Parser, Executor."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The lexer and scan components are part of the Parser, which is one of the four main query processing components in PostgreSQL."
    - content: "Cost estimator, Parser, Executor, Rewriter."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The cost estimator is functionality included in the Planner. The cost estimator isn't a separate query processing component."
  - content: "What is the result of running the following statement? EXPLAIN ANALYZE INSERT INTO animal (ani_id, name, weight_kg, cat_id, enc_id) VALUES (28, 'Robin - Robin', 0.5, 2, 4);"
    choices:
    - content: "The statement isn't syntactically correct and throws an error."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The statement is syntactically correct and executes without an error."
    - content: "The query plan for the INSERT statement is displayed, but the new record statement rolls back and doesn't insert into the animal table."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. EXPLAIN ANALYZE both displays an execution plan and make any changes to the database contained in the query statement."
    - content: "The query plan for the INSERT statement is displayed, and a new record is inserted into the animal table."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. EXPLAIN ANALYZE both executes the query and returns the execution plan for the query."
  - content: "You're working on a complex query. You would like to see the query optimizer's plan to help you understand why it's running slowly. What should you do?"
    choices:
    - content: "Add the keyword EXPLAIN before the query statement."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The keyword EXPLAIN displays the query optimizer's plan for the query, instead of running the query."
    - content: "Add the keyword ANALYZE before the query statement."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Adding ANALYZE before the query doesn't display the query optimizer's plan."
    - content: "Add the keywords EXPLAIN ANALYZE before the query statement."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. EXPLAIN ANALYZE both executes the query and returns the execution plan for the query. You only want to see the execution plan, and don't want to run the query."
