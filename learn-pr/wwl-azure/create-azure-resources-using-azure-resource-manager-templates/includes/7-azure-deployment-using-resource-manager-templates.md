**Estimated time:** 60 minutes.

**Lab files:** none.

## Scenario

In this lab, you'll create an Azure Resource Manager (ARM) template and modularize it using the linked template concept. You'll then modify the main deployment template to call the linked template and updated dependencies and finally deploy the templates to Azure.

## Objectives

After completing this lab, you'll be able to:

 -  Create a Resource Manager template.
 -  Create a Linked template for storage resources.
 -  Upload Linked Template to Azure Blob Storage and generate SAS token.
 -  Modify the main template to call the Linked template.
 -  Modify the main template to update dependencies.
 -  Deploy resources to Azure using linked templates.

## Requirements

 -  This lab requires **Microsoft Edge** or an [Azure DevOps-supported browser](/azure/devops/server/compatibility).
 -  **Set up an Azure DevOps organization:** If you don't already have an Azure DevOps organization that you can use for this lab, create one by following the instructions available at [Create an organization or project collection](/azure/devops/organizations/accounts/create-organization).
 -  Identify an existing Azure subscription or create a new one.
 -  Verify that you have a Microsoft account or an Azure AD account with the Contributor or the Owner role in the Azure subscription. For details, refer to [List Azure role assignments using the Azure portal](/azure/active-directory/roles/manage-roles-portal).
 -  [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). This will be installed as part of the prerequisites for this lab.

During this lab, you'll complete the following exercises:

 -  Exercise 0: Configure the lab prerequisites.
 -  Exercise 1: Author and deploy Azure Resource Manager templates.
 -  Exercise 2: Remove the Azure lab resources.
