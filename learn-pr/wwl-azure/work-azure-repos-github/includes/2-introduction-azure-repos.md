Azure Repos is a set of version control tools that you can use to manage your code.

Whether your software project is large or small, using version control is a good idea.

Azure Repos provides two types of version control:

 -  Git: distributed version control
 -  Team Foundation Version Control (TFVC): centralized version control

## What do I get with Azure Repos?

 -  Use of free private Git repositories, pull requests, and code search: Get unlimited private Git repository hosting and support for TFVC that scales from a hobby project to the world’s largest repository.
 -  Support for any Git client: Securely connect with and push code into your Git repos from any IDE, editor, or Git client.
 -  Web hooks and API integration: Add validations and extensions from the marketplace or build your own-using web hooks and REST APIs.
 -  Semantic code search: Quickly find what you are looking for with a code-aware search that understands classes and variables.
 -  Collab to build better code: Do more effective Git code reviews with threaded discussion and continuous integration for each change. Use forks to promote collaboration with inner source workflows.
 -  Automation with built-in CI/CD: Set up continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) to trigger builds, tests, and deployments automatically. It with every completed pull request-using Azure Pipelines or your tools.
 -  Protection of your code quality with branch policies: Keep code quality high by requiring code reviewer sign-out, successful builds, and passing tests before merge pull requests. Customize your branch policies to maintain your team’s high standards.
