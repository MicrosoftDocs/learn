  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "How is a KernelFunction object invoked with the Semantic Kernel SDK?"
    choices:
    - content: "By calling the `CreateAsync` method on the kernel."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Invocation is done with `InvokeAsync`, not `CreateAsync`."
    - content: "By using the `Execute` method with no arguments."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The method is `InvokeAsync` and requires arguments."
    - content: "By calling the `InvokeAsync` method on the KernelFunction object or kernel."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The `InvokeAsync` method is used to invoke a KernelFunction on either the object or kernel."
  - content: "In what scenario would zero-shot learning be most effective?"
    choices:
    - content: "When tasks require step-by-step explanations."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Zero-shot learning is not suited for detailed step-by-step tasks."
    - content: "When tasks are straightforward and require minimal guidance."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Zero-shot learning is ideal for simple, general tasks."
    - content: "When reducing ambiguity with specific examples is necessary."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Few-shot learning is better for reducing ambiguity with examples."
  - content: "What is the role of the ChatHistory object in the Semantic Kernel SDK?"
    choices:
    - content: "To maintain context and continuity in chat interactions."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The ChatHistory object ensures a smooth and context-aware conversation."
    - content: "To store a static set of predefined responses."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The ChatHistory object dynamically records the sequence of messages in a conversation."
    - content: "To act as a replacement for the ChatMessage object."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The ChatMessage object complements the ChatHistory object by adding detailed metadata."
