Now you're ready to create your own prompts with the Semantic Kernel SDK. In this exercise, you're provided a project with some starter code that you edit in the Azure Cloud Shell. You build and run prompt templates that help guide the model to act as a career services bot. The bot uses your prompts to recommend roles and provide a skills gap analysis to users.

Launch the exercise and follow the instructions.
