When you use the Semantic Kernel SDK, plugins act as the building blocks of your artificially intelligent (AI) application. Plugins define the tasks the kernel should complete. The kernel interfaces with a large language model (LLM) and runs the plugins you provide. 

Your plugins can include native code and natural language prompts, allowing you to use generative AI to perform a wide variety of tasks in your applications. From code generation to language translation, plugins allow you to define any desired behavior. Creating custom prompt plugins provides the flexibility for developers to tune their applications precisely to their needs.

Suppose you're a developer for Margie's Travel, a global leader in the travel and hospitality industry. You're tasked to create a personalized AI travel agent. You can create customized plugins that can allow your agent to provide destination recommendations, book accommodations, perform currency conversions, and even helpful phrases in a language of their choice. 

In this module, you can learn how to create your own Semantic Kernel SDK plugins. You can practice developing plugins to the SDK that accomplish different customized tasks. You can also learn how to use built-in plugins provided by the Semantic Kernel package to create intelligent applications.
