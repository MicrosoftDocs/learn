When using the Semantic Kernel SDK, kernel functions serve as the building blocks of your artificially intelligent (AI) application. You can create a kernel function from a prompt. The kernel interfaces with a large language model (LLM) and runs the prompt you provide. The prompts you create can help you use generative AI to perform a wide variety of tasks in your applications.

Suppose you're a developer for Margie's Travel, a global leader in the travel and hospitality industry. You're tasked to create a personalized AI travel agent. You can create customized functions that can allow your agent to provide destination recommendations, suggest activities, and even offer helpful phrases in a language of their choice. 

In this module, you learn how to create your own kernel functions with the Semantic Kernel SDK to create intelligent applications.
