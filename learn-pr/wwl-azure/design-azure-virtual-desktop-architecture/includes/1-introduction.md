The amount of available network bandwidth greatly impacts the quality of your experience. Various applications and display resolutions require different network configurations, so it's important to make sure your network is configured to meet your needs. This module shows you how to optimize network and operating system configurations to maximize performance.

The stress put on a network depends on both app workload's output frame rate and display resolution. If either the frame rate or display resolution increases, the bandwidth requirement will also rise. For example, a light workload with a high-resolution display requires more available bandwidth than a light workload with regular or low resolution.

Other scenarios can have their bandwidth requirements change depending on how you use them, such as:

 -  Voice or video conferencing
 -  Real-time communication
 -  Streaming 4K video
