  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "Which of the following correctly describes differences between the Basic and Standard tiers of IoT Hub?"
    choices:
    - content: "The Basic and Standard tiers support the same capabilities, but Standard provides higher throughput at an increased cost."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Basic and Standard support different capability sets."
    - content: "The Basic tier supports the full list of IoT Hub capabilities, while the Standard tier supports a subset. Equivalent levels of message throughput are available."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The Standard tier supports the full list of IoT Hub capabilities, while the Basic tier supports a subset. Both tiers offer the same levels of message throughput."
    - content: "The Basic tier does not support IoT Edge devices or cloud-to-device messaging, while the Standard tier supports the full list of IoT Hub capabilities. Both tiers offer the same levels of message throughput."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The Standard tier supports the full list of IoT Hub capabilities, while the Basic tier offers a subset of capabilities at a lower cost. Both tiers offer the same levels of message throughput."
  - content: "Which of the following lists the custom endpoints that IoT Hub supports?"
    choices:
    - content: "Azure Storage containers, Event Hubs, Service Bus Queues, Service Bus Topics"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. In addition to the built-in endpoint, IoT Hub currently supports Azure Storage containers, Event Hubs, Service Bus Queues, and Service Bus Topics as additional endpoints."
    - content: "Azure Blob storage, Azure File storage, Azure Table storage, Azure Cosmos BD"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. IoT Hub does support Azure Storage containers as a custom endpoint, but Azure Cosmos DB is not one of the supported custom endpoints."
    - content: "Azure Storage containers, Event Hubs, Azure SQL Database, Azure Data Lake Gen 2"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. IoT Hub does support Azure Storage containers and Events Hubs as custom endpoints, but Azure SQL Database and Azure Data Lake Gen 2 are not currently supported custom endpoints."
