title: Get started with generic and anonymous types
summary: Generics, and anonymous types in are powerful tools that help developers write flexible, reusable, and efficient code.&nbsp;Learn how to apply generics, advanced generics, and anonymous types in C#.&nbsp;
abstract: |
  -   Implement generic classes and methods to handle various data types efficiently.

  -   Utilize advanced generics features like generic interfaces, covariance, contravariance, and generic math to address complex scenarios.

  -   Apply anonymous types to create temporary, lightweight data structures for short-term use.

  -   Explore use cases for anonymous types and tuples.
prerequisites: |
  -   Visual Studio Code installed with the C# Dev Kit.

  -   Basic knowledge of the Visual Studio Code IDE.

  -   Basic understanding of the C# programming language.

  -   Familiar with classes, abstract classes, interfaces and inheritance.
