In this module, you learned about the core functionalities and use cases of C# collections. We covered `List<T>` for ordered, indexable data, `HashSet<T>` for managing unique elements, and `Dictionary<TKey, TValue>` for storing key-value pairs. You also explored common operations like adding, removing, and iterating through items, and scenarios where each collection is most effective, such as dynamic data binding with `ObservableCollection<T>` or performing set operations with `HashSet<T>`.

After completing this module, you're now able to:

- Use `List<T>` to manage ordered sequences of elements with dynamic resizing and indexed access.  
- Implement `HashSet<T>` to handle unique, unordered elements and perform set operations.  
- Utilize `Dictionary<TKey, TValue>` to store and retrieve data using unique key-value pairs.  
- Choose the appropriate collection type based on specific application requirements, such as ensuring uniqueness or enabling fast lookups.
