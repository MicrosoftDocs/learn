      explanation: "Incorrect. The Hot access tier is optimized for frequent reads and writes of objects in the storage account."
    - content: "Cool access tier"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The Cool access tier is for content that isn't viewed frequently, but must be available immediately, if accessed."
