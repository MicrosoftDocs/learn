  title: ""
  questions:
  - content: "What is the best way for Tailwind Traders to protect their warranty information?"
    choices:
    - content: "Legal hold policy"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That’s incorrect. Legal hold allows objects to be created or read, but not modified or deleted. It doesn’t provide a time frame and can be removed at any time."
    - content: "Time-based retention policy"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That’s correct. With a time-based retention policy, users can set policies to store data for a specified interval. When a time-based retention policy is in place, objects can be created and read, but not modified or deleted."
    - content: "Private endpoint for storage account"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That’s incorrect. A private endpoint is a special network interface for storage access from the virtual network."
  - content: "What type of storage should Tailwind Traders use for their photos and videos?"
    choices:
    - content: "Blob storage"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That’s correct. Blob storage is best for their photos."
    - content: "File storage"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That’s incorrect. Photos could be uploaded to file storage, but blob storage would be more appropriate."
    - content: "Disk storage"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That’s incorrect. Disk storage is more appropriate for virtual machine storage."
  - content: "What is the best way to provide the developer access to the ecommerce HTML files?"
    choices:
    - content: "Enable secure transfer"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That’s incorrect. Enable secure transfer accepts requests only from secure connections."
    - content: "Enable firewall policies and rules"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That’s incorrect. Firewall policies and rules are for network access."
    - content: "Shared access signatures"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That’s correct. Shared access signatures provide secure delegated access. This functionality can be used to define permissions and how long access is allowed."
  - content: "Which access tier should be used for the older versions of the product catalog?"
    choices:
    - content: "Hot access tier"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That’s incorrect. The hot tier is optimized for frequent reads and writes of objects in the storage account."
    - content: "Cool access tier"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That’s correct. The cool access tier is for content that wouldn’t be viewed frequently but must be available immediately if accessed."
    - content: "Archive access tier."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That’s incorrect. The older catalogs are accessed although infrequently. There’s an early deletion charge if data is accessed sooner than 180 days."
