quiz:
  title: ""
  questions:
  - content: "Which Azure storage redundancy model replicates data synchronously across three Azure availability zones within a region?"
    choices:
    - content: "Locally Redundant Storage (LRS)"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. LRS replicates data three times within a single data center in a region. It provides high durability and availability within the same data center but doesn't protect against data center failures or regional outages."
    - content: "Zone-Redundant Storage (ZRS)"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. ZRS replicates data synchronously across three Azure availability zones in a region. This model provides higher durability and availability by protecting against data center failures within a region."
    - content: "Geo-Redundant Storage (GRS)"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. GRS replicates data to a secondary region, hundreds of miles away from the primary location. This model provides the highest level of durability and availability by protecting against regional outages."
