Tailwind Traders wants to reduce storage costs by reducing duplicate content and migrating it to the cloud, when possible. The company is interested in a solution that centralizes maintenance while providing nation-wide access for customers. Customers should be able to browse and purchase items online even an entire Azure region goes offline. Here are some specific requirements:

- **Warranty document retention.** The Compliance and Legal teams require warranty documents be kept for three years. 

- **New photos and videos.** Each product has an accompanying photo or video to demonstrate the product.

- **External vendor development.** A vendor creates and develops some of the online e-commerce features. The developer needs access to the HTML files, but only during the development phase.

- **Product catalog updates.** The product catalog is updated every few months. Older versions of the catalog aren't viewed frequently, but they must be available immediately, if accessed.
