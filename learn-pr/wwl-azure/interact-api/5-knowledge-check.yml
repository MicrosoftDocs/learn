  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "What is the difference between a controller-based API and a minimal API in ASP.NET Core?"
    choices:
    - content: "Minimal APIs require more code and configuration than Controller-based APIs."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Minimal APIs are a simplified approach for building fast HTTP APIs with ASP.NET Core. You can build fully functioning REST endpoints with minimal code and configuration."
    - content: "Minimal APIs are used for handling web pages, not web API requests."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This statement is about Controller-based APIs, not Minimal APIs."
    - content: "Controller-based APIs map each endpoint to a specific controller class, while Minimal APIs declare API routes and actions to build fully functioning REST endpoints with minimal code and configuration."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Controller-based APIs are a traditional approach to building APIs in which each endpoint is mapped to a specific controller class, and minimal APIs declare routes and actions with minimal code."
