Caching is a common technique that aims to improve the performance and scalability of a system. It does this by temporarily copying frequently accessed data to fast storage located close to the application. If this fast data storage is located closer to the application than the original source, then caching can significantly improve response times for client applications by serving data more quickly.

After completing this module, you'll be able to:
