  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "Which of the Azure Cache for Redis service tiers is the lowest tier recommended for use in production scenarios?"
    choices:
    - content: "Basic"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The basic tier has no service-level agreement and is ideal for development/test and non-critical workloads."
    - content: "Standard"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. The standard tier is the lowest tier that offers replication，which is always recommended for production scenarios."
    - content: "Premium"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The premium tier is suitable for production, but it isn't the lowest tier recommended for production."
  - content: "Caching is important because it allows us to store commonly used values in memory. However, we also need a way to expire values when they're stale. In Redis this is done by applying a time to live (TTL) to a key. Which value represents the expire time resolution?"
    choices:
    - content: "1 millisecond"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. The expire time resolution is always 1 millisecond."
    - content: "10 milliseconds"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The expire time resolution is always 1 millisecond."
    - content: "seconds or milliseconds"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Expirations can be set using seconds or milliseconds precision, but the expire time resolution is always 1 millisecond."
