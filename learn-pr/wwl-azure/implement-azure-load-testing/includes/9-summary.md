In this module, you learned about Azure Load Testing, a service that allows developers and testers to generate high-scale loads to identify performance bottlenecks in applications and automate regression testing.

You learned how to create a top-level resource for Azure Load Testing, create load tests through a URL-based test or a JMeter test script, and make the test plan configurable using parameters. You also gained knowledge on how to configure a load test using YAML, simulate user traffic, and set test failure criteria and auto stop criteria. Additionally, you learned how to pass secrets and environment variables as parameters to a load test, store secrets in Azure Key Vault or a CI/CD pipeline's secret store, and use them in the Apache JMeter script.
