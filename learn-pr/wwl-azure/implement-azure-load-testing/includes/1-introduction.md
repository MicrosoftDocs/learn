Azure Load testing is a managed service that can be used to simulate load on your application's UI and APIs endpoints.

Azure Load Testing provides capabilities for automating load tests and integrating them into your continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) workflow. You can define test criteria, such as average response time or error thresholds, and automatically stop load tests based on specific error conditions.
