In the Azure portal, you can filter your Azure Monitor activity logs so you can view specific information. The filters enable you to review only the activity log data that meets your criteria. You might set filters to review monitoring data about critical events for your primary subscription and production virtual machine during peak business hours.

### Things to know about activity log filters

Let's review some of the filters you can set to control what data to review in your activity log:

- **Subscription**: Show the data for one or more specified Azure subscription names.

- **Timespan**: Show data for a specified time by choosing the start and end time for events, such as a six-hour period.

- **Event Severity**: Show events at the selected severity levels, including _Informational_, _Warning_, _Error_, or _Critical_.

- **Resource group**: Show data for one or more specified resource groups within your specified subscriptions.

- **Resource (name)**: Show data for the specified resources.

- **Resource type**: Show data for resources of a specified type, such as `Microsoft.Compute/virtualmachines`.

- **Operation name**: Show data for a selected Azure Resource Manager operation, such as `Microsoft.SQL/servers/Write`.

- **Event initiated by**: Show operation data for a specified user who performed the operation, referred to as the "caller."

After you define a set of filters, you can pin the filter set to the Azure Monitor dashboard. You can also download your activity log search results as a CSV file.

In addition to the filters, you can enter a text string in the **Search** box. Azure Monitor tries to match your search string against data returned for all fields in all events that corresponds to your filter settings.

### Things to know about event categories

The following table summarizes the categories of events that you can review in your activity logs. The information displayed for events is based on your other filter settings.
