The virtual datacenter (VDC) concept's primary purpose is to facilitate design and implementation of enterprise workloads. The VDC offers recommendations and best practices for implementing a collection of separate but related entities with common supporting functions, features, and infrastructure. VDC recommendations can reduce costs because of economies of scale, optimize security through component and data flow centralization, and simplify operations, management, and compliance audits.

The key to unlocking the advantages of VDC is a centralized hub and spoke network topology with a mix of Azure services and features:

- Azure Virtual Network
- Network security groups
- Virtual network peering
- User-defined routes
- Azure Identity with role-based access control (RBAC role)
- Azure DNS
- Azure Firewall
- Azure Front Door
- Azure Virtual WAN
