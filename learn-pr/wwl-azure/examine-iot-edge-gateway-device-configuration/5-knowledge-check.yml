  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "A developer wants to connect devices that aren't IP-enabled to an IoT hub using an IoT Edge gateway device. The developer wants each device to appear as a separate device in IoT Hub. Which IoT Edge gateway pattern should the developer use?"
    choices:
    - content: "Transparent"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The Transparent gateway pattern is used for IP-enabled devices."
    - content: "Protocol translation"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. When you use the Protocol translation gateway pattern, only the gateway device has an identity in IoT Hub."
    - content: "Identity translation"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. When you use the Identity translation gateway pattern, non-IP enabled downstream devices appear in IoT Hub as first-class devices with twins and methods."
  - content: "A developer wants to connect devices that aren't IP-enabled to an IoT hub using an IoT Edge gateway device. The developer wants only the IoT Edge gateway device to have an identity in IoT Hub. Which IoT Edge gateway pattern should the developer use?"
    choices:
    - content: "Transparent"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The Transparent gateway pattern is used for IP-enabled devices."
    - content: "Protocol translation"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. When you use the Protocol translation gateway pattern, devices that don't support MQTT, AMQP, or HTTP can use a gateway device to send data to IoT Hub on their behalf. Only the gateway device has an identity in IoT Hub."
    - content: "Identity translation"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. When you use the Identity translation gateway pattern, all devices have an identity in IoT Hub."
