  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "You want to connect devices that are not IP-enabled to your IoT hub using an IoT Edge Gateway device. You want each device to appear as a separate device in IoT Hub. Which Edge Gateway pattern should you use?"
    choices:
    - content: "Transparent"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The Transparent gateway pattern is used for IP-enabled devices."
    - content: "Protocol translation"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. When using the Protocol translation gateway pattern, only the gateway device has an identity in IoT Hub."
    - content: "Identity translation"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. When using the Identity translation gateway pattern, non-IP enabled downstream devices appear in IoT Hub as first-class devices with twins and methods."
  - content: "You want to connect devices that are not IP-enabled to your IoT hub using an IoT Edge Gateway device. You want only the Edge Gateway device to have an identity in IoT Hub. Which Edge Gateway pattern should you use?"
    choices:
    - content: "Transparent"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The Transparent gateway pattern is used for IP-enabled devices."
    - content: "Protocol translation"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. When using the Protocol translation gateway pattern, devices that do not support MQTT, AMQP, or HTTP can use a gateway device to send data to IoT Hub on their behalf. Only the gateway device has an identity in IoT Hub."
    - content: "Identity translation"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. When using the Identity translation gateway pattern, all devices have an identity in IoT Hub."
