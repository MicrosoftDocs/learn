Azure Monitor is a service in Azure that provides performance and availability monitoring for applications and services in Azure, other cloud environments, or on-premises environments.
You are in IT Operations at Tailwind Traders.  Part of your responsibilities include collaborating with the application developers in your organization. You need to be able to collect the appropriate log, performance, and error data generated by running their applications. As Tailwind Traders already has Azure Monitor in place, you decide that enabling Application Insights would be an ideal solution because it allows you to detect performance anomalies in those applications. Additionally, Application Insights provides you with powerful analytics tools so that you can more easily diagnose issues and better understand how your applications are used.

## Learning objectives

In this module you will learn how to:
- Describe how Application Insights is used to monitor application performance
- Distinguish between the different Application Insights sampling rates
- Describe Azure diagnostic settings and resource logs
- Leverage Azure SQL Insights to improve performance of Azure SQL database applications

## Prerequisites
- Understand the basic functionality of Azure Monitor and Log Analytics workspaces.
