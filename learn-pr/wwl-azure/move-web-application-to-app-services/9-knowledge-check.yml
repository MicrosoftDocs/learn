  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "When considering a migration, what is one reason the length of time the current solution has been deployed can complicate a migration?"
    choices:
    - content: "Shorter deployments may have fewer users."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Generally having less users can mean less of an impact on a migration."
    - content: "Longer deployments historically have cost more than shorter ones."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While \"sunk costs\" can be a factor, past costs generally have no impact on the complexity of a migration."
    - content: "Longer deployments may include dated technology that no one understands."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. In longer deployments, technology may have been used that no one on the current staff understands and that can make migration more difficult."
  - content: "When considering a migration, why would a team prioritize solution workloads?"
    choices:
    - content: "To determine which ones cost the most."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Prioritization isn't a costing exercise. It's done to help determine which ones should move first."
    - content: "To ensure all workloads get moved by the same engineering teams."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Prioritizing workloads can help determine which ones should move first and which ones to move later."
    - content: "To move the lowest priority workloads first."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Moving the lowest-priority workloads first allows the testing of the migration elements, which can help get a better understanding of the process before moving the higher priority ones."
