As you consider making the move to the cloud, carefully planning and exploring all the options can make that move efficient and smoother. In this module we've looked at some of the services available on Azure that can make your cloud implementation unified, powerful, and easier to manage than an on-premises installation.

By moving to Azure's cloud, you'll have the tools you need to build out a robust solution in one place. Azure gives you the security, scalability, and tools to manage even the most demanding workloads.

In this module, you learned how to:

* Describe hosting and scaling options for web apps in Azure
* Describe Azure services to help you monitor and secure your app
* Describe how the Azure DNS service can help with app security
* Migrate an app to Azure

While this review hasn't been exhaustive, we were able to survey some of the essential services that you can use on Azure. Many of them can be explored on a trial basis to see if they'll work for your situation.
