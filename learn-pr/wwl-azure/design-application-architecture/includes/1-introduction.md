The cloud is changing how applications are designed and secured. Instead of monoliths, applications are divided into smaller, decentralized services. These services communicate through APIs or by using asynchronous messaging or events. The services scale horizontally, adding new instances as demand requires.

These design changes bring new challenges. Application states are distributed, and operations are done in parallel and asynchronously. Applications must:
- Communicate with each other effectively.
- Be able to be deployed rapidly.
- Be resilient when failures occur.
- Be able to integrate with other systems seamlessly.

In this module, we explore how Azure lets you create applications composed of various components, including website front ends, back-end services, and triggered functions. We investigate how Azure includes various communication strategies to enable the components to pass data to each other.

## Meet Tailwind Traders

:::image type="icon" source="../media/tailwind-traders.png" border="false":::

Tailwind Traders is a fictitious home improvement retailer. The company operates retail hardware stores across the globe and online.

As you work through this lesson, suppose you work for Tailwind Traders. You're tasked with evaluating and designing an effective application architecture for the company. The architecture should provide the best Azure solutions for exchanging messages. The strategy must help automate deployment solutions for the company applications, respond appropriately to events, and manage configurations. You're researching how Azure enables integration with APIs and provides appropriate caching. 

## Learning objectives

In this module, you learn how to:

- Describe message and event scenarios.

- Design a messaging solution.

- Design an Azure Event Hubs messaging solution. 

- Design an event-driven solution.

- Design an automated app deployment solution.

- Design an API integration solution. 

- Design an application configuration management solution.

- Design a caching solution.
