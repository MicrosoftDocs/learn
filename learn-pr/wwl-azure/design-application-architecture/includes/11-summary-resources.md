During this module, you learned how to evaluate and design an effective application architecture that provides best of Azure solutions for exchanging messages, automate deployment solutions for your applications, manage configuration, integrate with APIs, and provide appropriate caching. You have also learned how to use these services to create scalable and efficient solutions.

Now that you've completed this module, you should be able to:

- Assess different messaging patterns and architecture.

- Design a messaging architecture. 

- Recommend an event-driven architecture.

- Evaluate automated deployment solutions for your applications.

- Select an application configuration management solution.

- Evaluate a solution for API integration.

- Recommend a caching solution for applications.
