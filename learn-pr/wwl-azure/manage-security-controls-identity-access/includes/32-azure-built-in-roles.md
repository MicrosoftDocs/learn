Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC) has several **Azure built-in roles** that you can assign to **users**, **groups**, **service principals**, and **managed identities**. Role assignments are the way you control access to Azure resources. If the built-in roles don't meet the specific needs of your organization, you can create your own Azure custom roles.

The following tables provide a brief description of each built-in role.

## General

| **Built-in role**                       | **Description**                                                                                                                                                     |

| Contributor                             | Grants full access to manage all resources, but does not allow you to assign roles in Azure RBAC, manage assignments in Azure Blueprints, or share image galleries. |
| Owner                                   | Grants full access to manage all resources, including the ability to assign roles in Azure RBAC.                                                                    |

| Azure Kubernetes Fleet Manager RBAC Admin         | This role grants admin access - provides write permissions on most objects within a namespace, with the exception of ResourceQuota object and the namespace object itself. Applying this role at cluster scope will give access across all namespaces.                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| Azure Kubernetes Fleet Manager RBAC Reader        | Allows read-only access to see most objects in a namespace. It does not allow viewing roles or role bindings. This role does not allow viewing Secrets, since reading the contents of Secrets enables access to ServiceAccount credentials in the namespace, which would allow API access as any ServiceAccount in the namespace (a form of privilege escalation). Applying this role at cluster scope will give access across all namespaces. |
| Azure Kubernetes Fleet Manager RBAC Writer        | Allows read/write access to most objects in a namespace. This role does not allow viewing or modifying roles or role bindings. However, this role allows accessing Secrets as any ServiceAccount in the namespace, so it can be used to gain the API access levels of any ServiceAccount in the namespace. Applying this role at cluster scope will give access across all namespaces.                                                         |

| Azure Kubernetes Service RBAC Reader              | Allows read-only access to see most objects in a namespace. It does not allow viewing roles or role bindings. This role does not allow viewing Secrets, since reading the contents of Secrets enables access to ServiceAccount credentials in the namespace, which would allow API access as any ServiceAccount in the namespace (a form of privilege escalation). Applying this role at cluster scope will give access across all namespaces. |
| Azure Kubernetes Service RBAC Writer              | Allows read/write access to most objects in a namespace. This role does not allow viewing or modifying roles or role bindings. However, this role allows accessing Secrets and running Pods as any ServiceAccount in the namespace, so it can be used to gain the API access levels of any ServiceAccount in the namespace. Applying this role at cluster scope will give access across all namespaces.                                        |
