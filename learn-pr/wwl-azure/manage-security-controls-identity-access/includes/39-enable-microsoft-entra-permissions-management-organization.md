Once you've enabled Permissions Management, you can connect it to your Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Platform (GCP) platforms.

> [!NOTE]
> To complete this task, you must have at least Billing Administrator permissions. You can't enable Permissions Management as a user from another tenant who has signed in via B2B or via Azure Lighthouse.

## Prerequisites

To enable Permissions Management in your organization:

 -  You must have a Microsoft Entra tenant. If you don't already have one, create a free account.<br>
 -  You must be eligible for or have an active assignment to the Permissions Management Administrator role as a user in that tenant.

## How to enable Permissions Management on your Microsoft Entra tenant

In your browser:

 -  Browse to the Microsoft Entra admin center and sign in to Microsoft Entra ID as at least a Billing Administrator.
 -  If needed, activate the *Permissions Management Administrator* role in your Microsoft Entra tenant.
 -  In the Azure portal, select **Microsoft Entra Permissions Management**, then select the link to purchase a license or begin a trial.

## Activate a free trial or paid license

There are two ways to activate a trial or a full product license.

1.  The first way is to go to the Microsoft 365 admin center.
    
    
     -  Sign in as a *Global Administrator* for your tenant.
     -  Go to Setup and sign up for a Microsoft Entra Permissions Management trial.
     -  For self-service, Go to the Microsoft 365 portal to sign up for a 45-day free trial or to purchase licenses.
2.  The second way is through Volume Licensing or Enterprise agreements.
    
    
     -  If your organization falls under a volume license or enterprise agreement scenario, contact your Microsoft representative.

Permissions Management launches with the **Data Collectors** dashboard.

## Configure data collection settings

1.  If the Data Collectors dashboard isn't displayed when Permissions Management launches:
    
    
     -  In the Permissions Management home page, select Settings (the gear icon), then select the Data Collectors subtab.
2.  Select the authorization system you want: AWS, Azure, or GCP.
