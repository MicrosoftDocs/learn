| Tenant                               | A dedicated and trusted instance of Microsoft Entra ID. The tenant is automatically created when your organization signs up for a Microsoft cloud service subscription. These subscriptions include Microsoft Azure, Microsoft Intune, or Microsoft 365. This tenant represents a single organization and is intended for managing your employees, business apps, and other internal resources. For this reason, it's considered a workforce tenant configuration. By contrast, you can create a tenant in an *external* configuration, which is used in customer identity and access management (CIAM) solutions for your consumer-facing apps (learn more about [Microsoft Entra External ID](/entra/external-id/customers/overview-customers-ciam)). |
| Single tenant                        | Azure tenants that access other services in a dedicated environment are considered single tenant.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Multitenant                          | Azure tenants that access other services in a shared environment, across multiple organizations, are considered multitenant.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Microsoft Entra directory            | Each Azure tenant has a dedicated and trusted Microsoft Entra directory. The Microsoft Entra directory includes the tenant's users, groups, and apps and is used to perform identity and access management functions for tenant resources.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Custom domain                        | Every new Microsoft Entra directory comes with an initial domain name, for example domainname.onmicrosoft.com. In addition to that initial name, you can also add your organization's domain names. Your organization's domain names include the names you use to do business and your users use to access your organization's resources, to the list. Adding custom domain names helps you to create user names that are familiar to your users, such as alain@contoso.com.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Microsoft account (also called, MSA) | Personal accounts that provide access to your consumer-oriented Microsoft products and cloud services. These products and services include Outlook, OneDrive, Xbox LIVE, or Microsoft 365. Your Microsoft account is created and stored in the Microsoft consumer identity account system that's run by Microsoft.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
