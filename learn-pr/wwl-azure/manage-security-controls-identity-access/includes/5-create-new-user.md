### Basics

The Basics tab contains the core fields required to create a new user. Before you begin, review the guidance on user name properties.

 -  **User principal name**: Enter a unique username and select a domain from the menu after the @ symbol. Select Domain not listed if you need to create a new domain. For more information, see Add your custom **domain name.<br>**
 -  **Mail nickname**: If you need to enter an email nickname that is different from the user principal name you entered, uncheck the Derive from user principal name option, then enter the mail nickname.
 -  **Display name**: Enter the user's name, such as Chris Green or Chris A. Green
 -  **Password**: Provide a password for the user to use during their initial sign-in. Uncheck the Auto-generate password option to enter a different password.
 -  **Account enabled**: This option is checked by default. Uncheck to prevent the new user from being able to sign-in. You can change this setting after the user is created. This setting was called Block sign in in the legacy create user process.

### Properties

There are five categories of user properties you can provide. These properties can be added or updated after the user is created. To manage these details, go to **Identity** &gt; **Users** &gt; **All users** and select a user to update.

 -  **Identity**: Enter the user's first and last name. Set the User type as either Member or Guest.<br>
 -  **Job information**: Add any job-related information, such as the user's job title, department, or manager.
 -  **Contact information**: Add any relevant contact information for the user.
 -  **Parental controls**: For organizations like K-12 school districts, the user's age group may need to be provided. Minors are 12 and under, Not adult are 13-18 years old, and Adults are 18 and over. The combination of age group and consent provided by parent options determine the Legal age group classification. The Legal age group classification may limit the user's access and authority.
 -  **Settings**: Specify the user's global location.
