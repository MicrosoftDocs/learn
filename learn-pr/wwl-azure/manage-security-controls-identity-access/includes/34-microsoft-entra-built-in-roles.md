In Microsoft Entra ID, if another administrator or non-administrator needs to manage Microsoft Entra resources, you assign them a Microsoft Entra role that provides the permissions they need. For example, you can **assign roles to allow adding** or **changing users**, **resetting user passwords**, **managing user licenses**, or **managing domain names**.

The following is a list of Microsoft Entra built-in roles and is not an exhaustive representation.

 -  Application Administrator **PRIVILEGED**
 -  Application Developer **PRIVILEGED**
 -  Attribute Assignment Administrator
 -  Attribute Assignment Reader
 -  Attribute Definition Administrator
 -  Attribute Definition Reader
 -  Attribute Log Administrator
 -  Attribute Log Reader
 -  Authentication Administrator **PRIVILEGED**
 -  Authentication Policy Administrator

## Application administrator

This is a privileged role. Users in this role can create and manage all aspects of enterprise applications, application registrations, and application proxy settings. Note that users assigned to this role are not added as owners when creating new application registrations or enterprise applications.

This role also grants the ability to consent for delegated permissions and application permissions, with the exception of application permissions for Microsoft Graph.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This exception means that you can still consent to application permissions for other apps (for example, non-Microsoft apps or apps that you have registered). You can still request these permissions as part of the app registration, but granting (that is, consenting to) these permissions requires a more privileged administrator, such as Global Administrator.

This role grants the ability to manage application credentials. Users assigned this role can add credentials to an application, and use those credentials to impersonate the application’s identity. If the application’s identity has been granted access to a resource, such as the ability to create or update User or other objects, then a user assigned to this role could perform those actions while impersonating the application. This ability to impersonate the application’s identity may be an elevation of privilege over what the user can do via their role assignments. It is important to understand that assigning a user to the Application Administrator role gives them the ability to impersonate an application’s identity.

## Authentication administrator

This is a privileged role. Assign the Authentication Administrator role to users who need to do the following:

 -  Set or reset any authentication method (including passwords) for non-administrators and some roles. For a list of the roles that an Authentication Administrator can read or update authentication methods, see Who can reset passwords.<br>
 -  Require users who are non-administrators or assigned to some roles to re-register against existing non-password credentials (for example, MFA or FIDO), and can also revoke remember MFA on the device, which prompts for MFA on the next sign-in.
 -  Perform sensitive actions for some users. For more information, see Who can perform sensitive actions.
 -  Create and manage support tickets in Azure and the Microsoft 365 admin center.

Users with this role **cannot** do the following:

 -  Cannot change the credentials or reset MFA for members and owners of a role-assignable group.<br>
 -  Cannot manage MFA settings in the legacy MFA management portal or Hardware OATH tokens.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Users with this role can change credentials for people who may have access to sensitive or private information or critical configuration inside and outside of Microsoft Entra ID. Changing the credentials of a user may mean the ability to assume that user's identity and permissions.

 -  Application Registration and Enterprise Application owners, who can manage credentials of apps they own. Those apps may have privileged permissions in Microsoft Entra ID and elsewhere not granted to Authentication Administrators. Through this path an Authentication Administrator can assume the identity of an application owner and then further assume the identity of a privileged application by updating the credentials for the application.<br>
 -  Azure subscription owners, who may have access to sensitive or private information or critical configuration in Azure.
 -  Security Group and Microsoft 365 group owners, who can manage group membership. Those groups may grant access to sensitive or private information or critical configuration in Microsoft Entra ID and elsewhere.
 -  Administrators in other services outside of Microsoft Entra ID like Exchange Online, Microsoft 365 Defender portal, Microsoft Purview compliance portal, and human resources systems.
 -  Non-administrators like executives, legal counsel, and human resources employees who may have access to sensitive or private information.
