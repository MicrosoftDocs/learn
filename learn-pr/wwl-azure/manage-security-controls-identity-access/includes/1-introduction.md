This module focuses on effectively managing security controls in Microsoft Entra ID by securing identities, authentication, and authorization to protect users, groups, and external identities against threats while ensuring secure and seamless access to resources.

## Scenario

Imagine you're an Azure security engineer responsible for securing identities and managing access controls in Microsoft Entra ID to protect users, groups, and external identities from security threats. You implement Microsoft Entra ID Protection, multifactor authentication, and Conditional Access policies to prevent unauthorized access while ensuring a seamless and secure user experience.

## Learning objectives

By the end of this module, participants will be able to:

 -  Secure user identities in Microsoft Entra ID by implementing strong authentication and access management controls.
 -  Protect groups and access management by enforcing security measures to prevent unauthorized changes or misuse.
 -  Manage external identities securely by defining policies that ensure confidentiality, integrity, and proper access control.
 -  Implement Microsoft Entra ID Protection to detect, investigate, and mitigate identity-related security threats.
 -  Apply Conditional Access policies to enforce security controls based on user behavior, device compliance, and contextual risks.

## Goals

The module aims to equip participants with the knowledge and skills necessary to manage security controls in Microsoft Entra ID by securing user identities, protecting groups, and enforcing security measures for external identities. Participants will also learn to implement Microsoft Entra ID Protection to proactively detect and respond to identity-related security threats while maintaining compliance and access integrity.
