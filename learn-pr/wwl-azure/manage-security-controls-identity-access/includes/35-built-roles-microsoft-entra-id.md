The ability to manage resources is granted by assigning roles that provide the required permissions. Roles can be assigned to individual users or groups. To align with the Zero Trust guiding principles, use Just-In-Time and Just-Enough-Access policies when assigning roles.

## Assign roles

There are two main steps to the role assignment process. First you'll select the role to assign. Then you'll adjust the role settings and duration.

### Select the role to assign

1.  Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com/) as a Privileged Role Administrator.
2.  Browse to **Identity** &gt; **Users** &gt; **All users**.

5.  Select a role to assign from the dropdown list and select the **Next** button.

## Adjust the role settings

You can assign roles as either **eligible** or **active**. Eligible roles are assigned to a user but must be elevated Just-In-Time by the user through Privileged Identity Management (PIM).

1.  From the Setting section of the **Add assignments** page, select an **Assignment type** option.<br>
2.  Leave the **Permanently eligible** option selected if the role should always be available to elevate for the user. If you uncheck this option, you can specify a date range for the role eligibility.
3.  Select the **Assign** button. Assigned roles appear in the associated section for the user, so eligible and active roles are listed separately.
