You've created your first Spring Cloud service, installed your microservices as applications, and exposed them through the **api-gateway**. Now that everything is up and running, it would be beneficial to monitor your applications availability. Monitoring helps you determine if there are errors or exceptions within your applications.

In this exercise, you'll add end-to-end monitoring to your applications.

## Learning objectives

After completing this module, you'll be able to:

 -  Live stream logs from your applications.
 -  Configure Application Insights to receive monitoring information from your applications.
 -  Analyze application specific monitoring data.
 -  Configure diagnostics settings.
 -  Analyze log files.

## Prerequisites

 -  Intermediate-level familiarity with and local installations of the following tools: Git, Java JDK 8 or later, and a Java IDE or text editor.
 -  Basic Git commands, including cloning, committing files, and pushing changes to GitHub.
 -  Intermediate-level familiarity with Azure.
