In this exercise, you create a GitHub workflow that performs an action when you merge a pull request.

## Prerequisites

* A [GitHub](https://github.com?azure-portal=true) account.
* The ability to navigate and edit files in GitHub.

## Getting started

When you select the **Start the exercise on GitHub** button, you're navigated to a public GitHub template repository that prompts you to complete a series of steps. Following are some tips for completing the exercise:

* Create a public repository because private repositories use Actions minutes.
* After you make your own repository from the template, wait about 20 seconds and refresh.
* Follow the instructions in the repository's README to understand how the exercise works, its learning objectives, and how to successfully complete the exercise.

When you're finished the exercise in GitHub, return here for:
