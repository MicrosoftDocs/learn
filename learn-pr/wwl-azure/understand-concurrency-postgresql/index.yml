  title: Understand concurrency in PostgreSQL
  description: "Azure Database for PostgreSQL is a multi-user relational database solution. The ability to support many concurrent users enables PostgreSQL databases to scale out and enable applications that support many users and locations at the same time. The increase in users brings a risk of conflicts and so it is important to understand the concurrency systems that are in place in Azure Database for PostgreSQL to manage concurrency and conflicts. In this module we will look at both isolation levels and locking in Azure Database for PostgreSQL."
