    - content: "Azure DNS manages the security and access to your website."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. In general, this statement is true, but it doesn't describe the primary purpose."
    - content: "Azure DNS manages and hosts the registered domain for a website and its associated records."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Azure DNS hosts the registered domains. Administrators can control and configure domain records like `A`, `CNAME`, and `MX`, and set up alias records."
    - content: "Azure DNS registers new domain names, so there's no need to use a domain registrar."
      isCorrect: false

  - content: "What type of DNS record can map one or more IP addresses against a single domain?"
    choices:
    - content: "`CNAME`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The `CNAME record maps a domain name to another domain name"
    - content: "`SOA`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The `SOA` record is the start of authority for the domain. It's used by other DNS servers to resolve the domain name."
    - content: "`A` or `AAAA`"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The `A` or `AAAA` record maps an IP address to a domain. Multiple IP addresses are known as a _record set_."
