A domain name system (DNS) is used to translate (or resolve) a service name to an IP address. Azure DNS is a service that lets you host the DNS records for your domains on Azure infrastructure. By implementing Azure DNS, you can use the same credentials, APIs, tools, and billing as your other Azure services.
