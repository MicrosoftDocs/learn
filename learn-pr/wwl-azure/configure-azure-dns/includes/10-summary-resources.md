Azure DNS is a hosting service for DNS domains that provides name resolution by using Microsoft Azure infrastructure. By hosting your domains in Azure, you can manage your DNS records by using the same credentials, APIs, tools, and billing as your other Azure services.

You should now be able to:

 -  Identify features and usage cases for domains, custom domains, and private zones.
 -  Verify custom domain names using DNS records.
 -  Implement DNS zones, DNS delegation, and DNS record sets.
