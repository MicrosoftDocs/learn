In this module, you learned about Azure DNS. You learned how to identify features and usage cases for domains, custom domains, and private zones. You also learned how to verify custom domain names using DNS records and implement DNS zones, delegation, and record sets. 

The main takeaways from this module are:

- Azure DNS is a hosting service that allows you to manage DNS domains using Microsoft Azure infrastructure.

- You can verify custom domain names using DNS records and implement DNS zones, delegation, and record sets.

- Azure DNS is a reliable and secure DNS service that eliminates the need for a custom DNS solution in a virtual network.

- Private DNS zones in Azure offer more flexibility in designing virtual network architecture and provide name resolution between virtual networks.
