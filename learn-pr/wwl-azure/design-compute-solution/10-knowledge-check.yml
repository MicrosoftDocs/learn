  questions:
  - content: "Which compute option best supports the real-time inventory tracking requirement?"
    choices:
    - content: "Azure Logic Apps"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. It's possible to implement the same logic in Azure Logic Apps. However, because the team has already invested time in building the service in C#, they can use the same code in an Azure function."
    - content: "Azure Functions"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The Tailwind Traders development team has already written the logic in C#. It makes sense to copy the relevant C# code from the Windows service and port it to an Azure function. The developers can bind the function to trigger each time a new message appears on a specific queue."
    - content: "Azure Virtual Machines"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Deploying virtual machines isn't the best solution in this scenario."
  - content: "What type of virtual machine is best for the datacenter migration requirement?"
    choices:
    - content: "General purpose VM"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. General purpose VMs are designed to have a balanced CPU-to-memory ratio. General-purpose VMs are ideal for testing and development, small to medium databases, and low to medium traffic web servers."
    - content: "Compute-optimized VM"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Compute-optimized VMs are designed to have a high CPU-to-memory ratio. Compute-optimized VMs are suitable for medium traffic web servers, network appliances, batch processes, and application servers."
    - content: "Memory-optimized VM"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Memory-optimized VMs are designed to have a high memory-to-CPU ratio. Memory-optimized VMs are great for relational database servers, medium to large caches, and in-memory analytics."
  - content: "What compute solution is best for hosting the company's data processing application?"
    choices:
    - content: "Azure Container Instances"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Azure Container Instances is an ideal compute solution for containers. The company can achieve significant cost savings by using per-second billing."
    - content: "Azure Virtual Machines"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Provisioning virtual machines can be more expensive and underutilized."
    - content: "Web Apps (supported by Azure App Service)"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The Web Apps feature is a better option for hosted web applications."
