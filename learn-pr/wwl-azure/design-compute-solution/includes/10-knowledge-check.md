Tailwind Traders has several active development projects. As the solution Architect for the company, you're responsible for selecting the right compute technology for each project. Ideally, you'd like to create compute resources and configure them to do the work and only pay for the services used.

Here are the specific project requirements:

- **Real-time inventory tracking.** Each evening, product availability is updated on the company website. The management team wants the stock inventory updated as soon as products are ordered. To fulfill this requirement, the product database needs to be updated, and stock reorder notifications need to be sent, as needed. The current program is a Windows service written in C#.

- **Migrate datacenter virtual machines**. The datacenter virtual machines host relational database servers. These machines are used for online orders. The company needs a solution to move this capability to the cloud. 

- **Host data processing application in the cloud.** The company has a small data processing application. The app ingests new product photos and writes the content to Azure Blob Storage. The app takes only a few seconds to run. The sales team needs a solution that hosts the app in the cloud and reduces costs.
