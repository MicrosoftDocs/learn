In this module, we explore AI-ready compute solutions available in Azure. We look at Azure Virtual Machines, Azure Logic Apps, Azure App Service, Azure Functions, Azure Kubernetes Service, and other options. Some compute solutions support serverless scenarios, while other solutions work well with virtual machines and containers. We examine fast, scalable, flexible solution options to add compute power to your infrastructure. 

## Meet Tailwind Traders

:::image type="icon" source="../media/tailwind-traders-logo.png" border="false":::

Tailwind Traders is a fictitious home improvement retailer. The company operates retail hardware stores across the globe and online.

As you work through this module, suppose you work for Tailwind Traders. The management team needs your input on several development projects that need to migrate to the cloud. There are also several new projects that should be optimized for the cloud. The departmental budgets are tight. It's important to select the right compute technology for each project. Ideally, you'd like to create and configure compute resources for each project, and pay only for the resources and services used.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you learn how to:

- Choose an Azure compute service.
