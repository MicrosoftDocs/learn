AI tools for developers can enhance productivity and reduce the likelihood of human error. But with so many tools available, it's challenging to know which tool is best suited for a particular project or individual.

To help align AI tools with development tasks and projects, this unit examines the following resources:

- Azure AI services.
- Azure AI Studio.
- AI Builder.
- Copilot Studio.
- Semantic Kernel SDK.
- Visual Studio IntelliCode.
- ChatGPT.
- GitHub Copilot.

## Azure AI services

The Azure AI services are a set of cloud-based services that enable developers to build AI-powered applications without requiring expertise in machine learning. These services cover a wide range of AI capabilities, including speech recognition, natural language processing, computer vision, and decision-making. Azure AI services are designed to be easy to use and integrate with existing applications.

## Copilot Studio

Copilot Studio is a copilot authoring tool that enables user to create and manage AI-powered chatbots. It provides a visual interface for designing conversational flows, training chatbots, and monitoring their performance. Copilot Studio supports natural language understanding (NLU) and natural language generation (NLG) capabilities, allowing users to build chatbots that can understand and respond to user queries.

> [!NOTE]
> A copilot is an AI-powered conversational interface based on large language models (LLMs) and additional sources of knowledge. It's a powerful AI companion that can handle a range of requests, from providing simple responses to common questions to resolving issues requiring complex conversations. Copilots can engage with customers and employees in multiple languages across websites, mobile apps, Facebook, Microsoft Teams, or any channel supported by the Azure Bot Service.

You can easily create copilots in Copilot Studio without the need for data scientists or developers. The platform provides a range of templates and tools to help you design and train chatbots, making it easy to get started. Copilot Studio also includes features for monitoring chatbot performance, analyzing user interactions, and improving conversational flows over time.

Some of the ways you might use copilots include:

- Sales help and support issues.
- Opening hours and store information.
- Employee health and vacation benefits.
- Public health tracking information.
- Common employee questions for businesses.

Copilot Studio is available as a standalone web app, and as a discrete app within Teams. Most of the functionality between the two is the same. However, there might be different reasons to choose one version or the other based on the ways you want to use Copilot Studio.

Copilot Studio is intended for:

- Users who want to create and manage AI-powered chatbots without needing to write code.
- Business analysts who need to build chatbots to automate customer interactions.
- Organizations that want to empower users with chatbot capabilities without requiring specialized expertise.
- Projects that require chatbots to handle customer inquiries, provide support, or automate business processes.

## Semantic Kernel SDK

The Semantic Kernel SDK enables developers to implement AI model interactions within their existing code project.

Today's AI models can easily generate text responses and images based on user supplied prompts. While this capability is helpful when building a simple chat app, it's not enough to build fully automated AI agents that can automate business processes and empower users to achieve more. To do so, you need a framework that can take the responses from these models and use them to influence and support actions within existing code. The Semantic Kernel SDK provides the framework needed to create these types of projects.

Semantic Kernel is an open-source SDK that lets you easily build agents that can interact with AI models and use responses to enhance your existing code. As a highly extensible SDK, you can use Semantic Kernel with models from OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, Hugging Face, and others. By combining your existing C#, Python, and Java code with these models, you can build agents that extend your applications in ways that were previously impossible.

Semantic Kernel SDK is intended for:

- Developers who want to integrate AI models into their existing code projects.
- Organizations that want to build AI-powered agents to automate business processes.
- Projects that require AI models to interact with existing code and influence actions.

## Visual Studio IntelliCode

Visual Studio IntelliCode is an extension for Visual Studio that enhances the coding experience by providing AI-powered recommendations. IntelliCode uses machine learning models trained on thousands of open-source projects to suggest context-appropriate code completions. It supports multiple programming languages and helps developers write more reliable and maintainable code.

Visual Studio IntelliCode features:

- **AI-Powered Code Completions**: Offers intelligent suggestions that go beyond simple alphabetical lists, understanding coding patterns and practices.

Visual Studio IntelliCode is intended for:

- Developers who want to improve their coding productivity and efficiency.
- Teams that want to maintain consistent coding practices and code quality.
- Projects that require code completions, refactoring assistance, and code style inference.

## ChatGPT

ChatGPT is a conversational AI model developed by OpenAI that can engage in human-like conversations on a wide range of topics. It's designed to generate coherent and contextually relevant responses to user queries. ChatGPT can be used in chatbots, virtual assistants, and other conversational applications to provide engaging and informative interactions.

ChatGPT can be used to generate code snippets, provide explanations of programming concepts, and assist with debugging tasks. However, it's important to note that ChatGPT is not designed for programming tasks and may not always provide accurate or relevant code suggestions. Developers should use ChatGPT as a general-purpose conversational AI model and verify the accuracy of its responses before incorporating them into their code.

Since ChatGPT isn't integrated into a development environment, it may be better for generating ideas or explanations rather than directly writing code. Developers can use ChatGPT to brainstorm solutions, clarify concepts, or explore new ideas before implementing them in their codebase.

ChatGPT is intended for:

- Developers or teams who want to brainstorm solutions, clarify concepts, or explore new ideas outside of the development environment.
- Projects that require conversational AI capabilities for chatbots, virtual assistants, or other applications.
- Organizations that want to experiment with AI models for conversational interactions.
- Citizen developers who want to build an application or web site for personal use.
