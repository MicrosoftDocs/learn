GitHub Copilot natively integrates with Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, and other developer environments.

GitHub Copilot uses two extensions for Visual Studio Code:

- GitHub Copilot: The GitHub Copilot extension supports code completions, including code suggestions generated using code comments.

- GitHub Copilot Chat: The GitHub Copilot Chat extension supports the AI peer programming tools, including chat conversations between the user and AI models.
