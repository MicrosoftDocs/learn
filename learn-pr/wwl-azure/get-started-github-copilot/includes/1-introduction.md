> [!IMPORTANT]
> To complete this GitHub Copilot training, you must have an active subscription for GitHub Copilot in your personal GitHub account (includes the GitHub Copilot Free plan), or you must be assigned to a subscription managed by an organization or enterprise. Module activities may include GitHub Copilot suggestions that match public code. If you're a member of an organization on GitHub Enterprise Cloud who has been assigned a GitHub Copilot subscription through your organization, the setting for suggestions matching public code may be inherited from your organization or enterprise. If your account blocks suggestions that match public code, module activities may not work as expected.
