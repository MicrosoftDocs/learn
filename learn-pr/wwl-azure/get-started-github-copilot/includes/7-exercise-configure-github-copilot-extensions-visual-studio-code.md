GitHub Copilot settings are configured in your GitHub.com account and the Visual Studio Code environment. In Visual Studio Code, you access settings for GitHub Copilot and GitHub Copilot Chat using the GitHub Copilot status menu. The settings allow you to enable or disable GitHub Copilot for specific languages, configure the behavior of GitHub Copilot Chat, and customize the GitHub Copilot experience to suit your preferences. You can also configure GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com to manage your GitHub Copilot subscription, configure the retention of prompts and suggestions, and allow or block suggestions matching public code.

## Configure GitHub Copilot and Copilot Chat in Visual Studio Code

The GitHub Copilot extensions are configured with default settings when you install the extensions in Visual Studio Code. You can customize these settings to suit your preferences.

Visual Studio Code provides two ways to access the settings for the GitHub Copilot extensions:

- You can use the `Manage` icon to open the Visual Studio Code Settings tab. On the Settings tab, you can select **Extensions** and then select **Copilot**.
- You can use the GitHub Copilot status icon to access the GitHub Copilot status menu and then select **Edit Settings**.

    Notice that the settings list is now filtered for GitHub Copilot only.

    The settings for GitHub Copilot include the following options:

    - Enable Auto Completions
    - Enable or disable Copilot completions for specified languages

1. Take a minute to review the settings for **Enable or disable Copilot completions for specified languages**.

    Notice that the settings for this option are configured using a list of languages and a value of **true** or **false** to enable or disable GitHub Copilot for each language. By default, GitHub Copilot is enabled for all languages. This setting is specified with the wildcard character `*` on the first row and the value **true**. The subsequent rows specify languages for which GitHub Copilot is enabled or disabled. For example, GitHub Copilot is enabled for **C#**, **JavaScript**, and **Python** and disabled for **Plaintext** and **Markdown**.

1. Under **Enable or disable Copilot completions for specified languages**, select **markdown**.

    Notice that the value for Markdown is set to **false**. This means that GitHub Copilot is disabled for Markdown files.

1. To enable Copilot for Markdown files, select **Edit Item** (pencil icon), select **false**, change the value to **true**, and then select **OK**.

    The settings for GitHub Copilot Chat include **Preview** and **Experimental** options. Setting choices include the following options:

    - **Fix Test Failure**: This option is enabled by default so that GitHub Copilot can provide suggestions for fixing test failures.
    - **Follow Ups**: By default, this setting is set to **firstOnly**, which means that GitHub Copilot provides follow-up suggestions only after the first suggestion. The other options are **always** and **never**.
    - **Local Override**: By default, this option is set to **auto**, which means that GitHub Copilot uses the locale of the Visual Studio Code display language.
    - **Scope Selection**: This option is disabled by default. When enabled, the user is prompted for a scope symbol when the user uses `/explain` in Chat without anything selected in the Editor.
    - **Terminal Chat Location**: The default setting is chatView, which specifies the Chat View. The other options are for the Quick Chat area and the Terminal.
    - **Use Project Templates**: This option is enabled by default so that GitHub Copilot uses relevant GitHub project templates when the user uses `/new` in Chat.
    - **Enable Code Actions**: This option is enabled by default so that GitHub Copilot can provide code actions in the Editor.
    - **Trigger Automatically**: This option is enabled by default so that GitHub Copilot suggestions are shown automatically as you type.

    We recommend keeping the default settings during this training. This helps to ensure that you have the expected experience when working on the modules in this learning path. When you have completed the training, you can experiment with these settings to customize your experience with GitHub Copilot and Copilot Chat.
