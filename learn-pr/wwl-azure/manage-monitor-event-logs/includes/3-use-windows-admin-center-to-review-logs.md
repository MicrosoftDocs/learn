Windows Admin Center is a web-based console that you can use to manage computers that are running Windows Server and Windows 10. Typically, you use Windows Admin Center to manage servers instead of using Remote Server Administration Tools.

> Windows Admin Center works with any browser thatâ€™s compliant with modern standards, and you can install it on computers that run Windows 10 and Windows Server.
