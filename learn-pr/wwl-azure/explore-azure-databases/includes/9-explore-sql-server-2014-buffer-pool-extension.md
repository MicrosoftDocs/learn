SQL Server 2014 introduced a new feature, the Buffer Pool Extension. This functionality extends the buffer pool of SQL Server, which is kept in memory with a second-level cache that is backed by local SSDs of a server or VM. The buffer pool extension enables keeping a larger working set of data 'in memory'. Compared to accessing Azure Standard Storage the access into the extension of the buffer pool, which is stored on local SSDs of an Azure VM is many factors faster. Comparing Buffer Pool Extension to Azure Premium Storage Read Cache, as recommended for SQL Server data files, no significant advantages are expected for Buffer Pool Extensions. The reason is that both caches (SQL Server Buffer Pool Extension and Premium Storage Read Cache) are using the local disks of the Azure compute node.

Experiences gained in SQL Server Buffer Pool Extension with SAP workload are mixed and still do not provide clear recommendations on whether to use it in all cases. The ideal case is that the working set the SAP application requires fits into main memory. With Azure meanwhile offering VMs that come with up to 4 TB of memory, it should be possible to keep the working set in memory. Hence the usage of Buffer Pool Extension is limited to some rare cases and should not be a mainstream case.
