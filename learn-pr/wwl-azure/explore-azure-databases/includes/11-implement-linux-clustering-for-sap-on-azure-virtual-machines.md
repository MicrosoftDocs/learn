All tasks in this lab are performed from the Azure portal (including the Bash Cloud Shell session).

> [!NOTE]
> When not using Cloud Shell, the lab virtual machine must have [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli-windows) installed and include an SSH client, such as [PuTTY](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html).
