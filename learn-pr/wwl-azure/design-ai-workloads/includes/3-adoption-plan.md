## Plan for AI adoption

An [AI adoption plan](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/scenarios/ai/plan) helps turn an AI strategy into real, actionable work. It keeps your AI projects aligned with business priorities, helps you think through the skills and resources you need, and makes it easier to plan timelines you can deliver on.

### Assess AI skills 

Use a skills-and-data readiness framework to objectively evaluate your organization's current AI capability. This framework helps determine which use cases are feasible based on your maturity level.

| Level | Skills| Data Readiness | Feasible use cases |
| - | - | - | - |
| 1 | Basic AI concepts. Simple prompts. | Minimal to enterprise data. | Azure quick start projects. Copilot solutions. |
| 2 | Model selection. Deployment basics. Data cleaning. | Minimal to small, structured datasets. | Analytical AI. Generative AI app (no RAG). Simple ML app. | 
| 3 | Prompt engineering. Preprocessing. Chunking. | Historical business data available. | Generative AI app with RAG. Custom ML model. Small AI model on Azure VMs. |
| 4 | Advanced ML. Orchestration. Optimization. | Large, high-quality datasets. | Large AI workloads on VMs, AKS, or ACA. |

### Acquire AI skills 

Address any skills gaps through training, hiring, or partnerships. Fixing your skill gaps reduces delays and lowers project risk. Microsoft Learn is provides free AI training, certifications, and product guidance. 

## Access AI resources
Clear access and licensing planning helps avoid delays, control costs, and stay compliant. Each AI solution has different access needs, so you need to understand them to plan security and budgets correctly.

### Prioritize AI use cases 

Prioritizing your AI use cases helps you focus time and effort on the projects that matter most and that your organization is ready to take on. By ranking use cases based on feasibility, business value, and available resources, you can reduce risk and start delivering results sooner. This approach makes it easier to build a realistic roadmap that your team can execute.

### Validate concepts through proof of concepts 

Proof of concepts (PoCs) helps reduce implementation risk by letting you test ideas before committing to full‑scale development. A PoC gives you a safe, controlled way to confirm that a solution is technically feasible and delivers business value. By focusing your validation efforts, you can spot issues early and get the insights you need to make smarter, more confident decisions.

### Establish responsible AI practices

Responsible AI practices help protect your organization from ethical, legal, and reputational risks, while making sure AI solutions reflect your organization’s values. By building these principles early, you can avoid costly rework later and earn trust from stakeholders. Build ethics, governance, and security into the plan from the beginning, rather than adding them later.

### Estimate delivery timelines

Setting realistic timelines ensures smoother resource planning and better stakeholder alignment. How accurate your estimates are depends on the complexity of the project, how mature your organization is, and what resources you have available. To avoid guesswork, base your timelines on what you learn from proof‑of‑concepts and what your team can support.
