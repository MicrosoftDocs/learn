This module walks you through how to design and run Azure AI workloads by choosing the right blend of SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS services. The content focused on aligning AI solutions with business goals, skills, and governance, while applying security, operations, and responsible AI best practices.

### Key takeaways

* Use SaaS for fast productivity gains, PaaS for scalable and customizable solutions, and IaaS for regulated or high‑control workloads.

* Prioritize use cases, assess skills and data readiness, validate solutions with proofs of concept, and set realistic timelines.

* Select specialized compute, high‑throughput storage, and low‑latency networking with Azure landing zones.

* Use Azure AI platforms for generative and nongenerative AI with built‑in orchestration, data grounding, and secure networking.

* To reduce risk and ensure accountability, govern AI across security, cost, data, compliance, and operations.

* Protect AI workloads with AI‑specific security controls and manage them across deployment, cost, data, monitoring, and business continuity.
