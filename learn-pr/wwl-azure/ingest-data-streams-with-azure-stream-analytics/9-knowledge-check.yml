    - content: "A windowing function that segment a data stream into a contiguous series of fixed-size, non-overlapping time segments and operate against them. Events cannot belong to more than one tumbling window."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Tumbling window functions segment a data stream into a contiguous series of fixed-size, non-overlapping time segments and operate against them."
    - content: "A windowing function that groups events by identical timestamp values."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A windowing function that groups events by identical timestamp values describes a Snapshot window."

      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Azure Blob storage is one of the three supported input sources for Azure Stream Analytics jobs."
    - content: "Azure Cosmos DB"

      explanation: "Correct. Azure Cosmos DB is a valid **output** for your Stream Analytics jobs but cannot be used as an input."
    - content: "Azure Event Hubs"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Azure Event Hubs is a supported input source for Azure Stream Analytics jobs and can ingest real-time streaming data."
  - content: "Below is a list of key benefits of using Azure Stream Analytics to process streaming data. Which of the following statements is incorrect?"
    choices:
    - content: "The ability to write and test transformation queries in the Azure portal"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That is not correct. Using the Azure portal to write and test your transformation queries using the SQL-like Stream Analytics Query Language (SAQL) is a key benefit. You can use the built-in functions of SAQL to find interesting patterns from the incoming stream of data."
    - content: "Being able to rapidly deploy queries into production by creating and starting an Azure Stream Analytics job"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That is not the correct answer. The ability to rapidly deploy your queries into production by creating and starting an Azure Stream Analytics job is one of the key benefits of using Azure Stream Analytics to process streaming data."
    - content: "Integration with Azure Blob storage"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Integration with Azure Blob storage is not one of the primary benefits of using Azure Stream Analytics to process _streaming_ data. The integration with Blob storage can be used to process _static_ data."
