## Scenario

Your organization requires control of the network traffic to and from the web application. To further enhance the security of the web application, network security groups (NSG) and application security groups (ASG) can be configured. NSG is a security layer that filters network traffic to and from Azure resources, while ASG allows grouping of resources to be managed collectively. These security groups provide fine-grained control over the network traffic to and from the web application components.
