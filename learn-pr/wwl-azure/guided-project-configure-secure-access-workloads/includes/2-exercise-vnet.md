## Scenario 

The IT department needs network isolation and segmentation for the web application. Once the virtual network is created, the next step would be to configure virtual network peering. This peering allows the virtual networks to communicate with each other securely and privately.

To provide network isolation and segmentation for the web application, you create an Azure virtual network and configure subnets and virtual network peering.
