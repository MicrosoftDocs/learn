In the context of platform engineering, enabling developers to independently manage their resources and workflows has become a cornerstone of productivity and innovation. Providing developers with the tools to provision and managing infrastructure fosters agility and accelerates development cycles. However, this flexibility must be combined with robust governance to ensure security, compliance, and operational consistency across the platform.

Developer self-service thrives when paired with thoughtful governance frameworks and automation strategies that maintain oversight without stifling flexibility. This approach ensures developers can work efficiently while the platform adheres to organizational standards and safeguards. By using modern tools and techniques, organizations can create controlled yet agile environments where developers have seamless access to resources, supported by secure access controls, audit trails, and automated workflows that align with best practices.

This module introduces you to the concept of developer self-service within platform engineering. It covers the importance of enabling developers to independently manage their resources and workflows, and the balance between self-service and governance. The module explores various tools and techniques, such as Azure Deployment Environments and Microsoft Dev Box, to streamline and automate developer workflows. It also delves into the architecture of a developer self-service platform, including components like the Developer Platform API, Developer Platform Graph, and Developer Platform Orchestrator. Additionally, the module discusses governance and security measures to ensure compliance and protect against risks associated with self-service workflows.
