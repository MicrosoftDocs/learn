  title: "Check Your Knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "What is one significant way computer programming has changed?"
    choices:
    - content: "Programmers no longer use computer code."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Most programming is still done with code."
    - content: "Applications are stored on mainframes."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Mainframes were used heavily in the past, but modern computing rarely uses them."
    - content: "Programs can now be used from the internet."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Programmers can write small programs called functions to do just one thing and call them from the internet."
  - content: "How do mainframes and the cloud differ?"
    choices:
    - content: "The cloud doesn't rely on computer servers, but mainframes do."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Both the cloud and mainframes use servers."
    - content: "Mainframes are more secure than the cloud."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. While some mainframes were very secure because they weren't on a network, modern cloud computers are just as secure as mainframes."
    - content: "The cloud scales but mainframes don't."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. This is one big difference between the two. The cloud can grow and shrink based on need."
  - content: "What is a benefit of getting application data over the internet versus on a disk?"
    choices:
    - content: "The data is more secure."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Both data delivered over the internet and on disk are secure."
    - content: "The data is less prone to being corrupt."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Data delivered over the internet and on disk can get corrupted occasionally."
    - content: "The data can be updated."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. By delivering data over the internet, it's possible to update it when needed. This isn't possible with data delivered on disk."
