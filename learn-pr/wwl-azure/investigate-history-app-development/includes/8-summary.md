You've learned in this module that computers have come a long way since they were invented. Computers used to be the size of rooms. They typically did just a few things. And they were hard to scale.

Modern cloud computing made both the hardware and software more modular. Programs can be as small as a single function but can be used with other programs. Programs designed in this way give them a lot of power. Hardware can also scale up and down depending on how much power and storage are needed. Modern computing lets people from all over the world use applications and store data.

Specifically, this module explored the following areas:

 -  A brief history of computing from mainframes to the modern cloud
 -  How programs changed. They went from large applications that were difficult to update to nimble apps that require less maintenance by users
 -  How the internet empowered computer developers to more with less overhead

It's an exciting time to be a software developer. The cloud and modern tools open up a lot of opportunities. Computers are at the center of modern life. The engineers that build the software and hardware make the modern home and office possible.
