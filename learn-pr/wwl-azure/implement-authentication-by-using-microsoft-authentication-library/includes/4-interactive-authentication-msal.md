In this exercise, you register an application in Microsoft Entra ID, then create a .NET console application that uses MSAL.NET to perform interactive authentication and acquire an access token for Microsoft Graph. You learn how to configure authentication scopes, handle user consent, and see how tokens are cached for subsequent runs. 

Tasks performed in this exercise:

* Register an application with the Microsoft identity platform
* Create a .NET console app that implements the  **PublicClientApplicationBuilder** class to configure authentication.
* Acquire a token interactively using the **user.read** Microsoft Graph permission.

This exercise takes approximately **15** minutes to complete.
