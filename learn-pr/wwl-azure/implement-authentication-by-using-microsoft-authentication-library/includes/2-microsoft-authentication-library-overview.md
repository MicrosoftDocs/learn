The Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL) enables developers to acquire security tokens from the Microsoft identity platform to authenticate users and access secured web APIs. It can be used to provide secure access to Microsoft Graph, other Microsoft APIs, third-party web APIs, or your own web API. MSAL supports many different application architectures and platforms including .NET, JavaScript, Java, Python, Android, and iOS.

MSAL gives you many ways to get tokens, with a consistent API for many platforms. Using MSAL provides the following benefits:

* No need to directly use the OAuth libraries or code against the protocol in your application.
* Acquires tokens on behalf of a user or on behalf of an application (when applicable to the platform).
* Maintains a token cache and refreshes tokens for you when they're close to expire. You don't need to handle token expiration on your own.
* Helps you specify which audience you want your application to sign in.
* Helps you set up your application from configuration files.
* Helps you troubleshoot your app by exposing actionable exceptions, logging, and telemetry.

 ## Application types and scenarios

Within MSAL, a token can be acquired from many application types: web applications, web APIs, single-page apps (JavaScript), mobile and native applications, and daemons and server-side applications. MSAL currently supports the platforms and frameworks listed in the following table.

## Authentication flows

The following table shows some of the different authentication flows provided by Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL). These flows can be used in various application scenarios.

| Authentication flow | Enables | Supported application types |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Authorization code | User sign-in and access to web APIs on behalf of the user. | Desktop, Mobile, Single-page app (SPA) (requires PKCE), Web |
| Client credentials | Access to web APIs by using the identity of the application itself. Typically used for server-to-server communication and automated scripts requiring no user interaction. | Daemon |
| Device code | User sign-in and access to web APIs on behalf of the user on input-constrained devices like smart TVs and IoT devices. Also used by command line interface (CLI) applications. | Desktop, Mobile |
| Implicit grant | User sign-in and access to web APIs on behalf of the user. *The implicit grant flow is no longer recommended - use authorization code with PKCE instead.* | Single-page app (SPA), Web |
| On-behalf-of (OBO) | Access from an "upstream" web API to a "downstream" web API on behalf of the user. The user's identity and delegated permissions are passed through to the downstream API from the upstream API. | Web API |
| Username/password (ROPC) | Allows an application to sign in the user by directly handling their password. *The ROPC flow is NOT recommended.* | Desktop, Mobile |
| Integrated Windows authentication (IWA) | Allows applications on domain or Microsoft Entra joined computers to acquire a token silently (without any UI interaction from the user). | Desktop, Mobile |

## Public client and confidential client applications

The Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL) defines two types of clients; public clients and confidential clients. A client is a software entity that has a unique identifier assigned by an identity provider. The client types differ based their ability to authenticate securely with the authorization server and to hold sensitive, identity proving information so that it can't be accessed or known to a user within the scope of its access.

When examining the public or confidential nature of a given client, we're evaluating the ability of that client to prove its identity to the authorization server. This is important because the authorization server must be able to trust the identity of the client in order to issue access tokens.

* **Public client applications** run on devices, such as desktop, browserless APIs, mobile or client-side browser apps. They can't be trusted to safely keep application secrets, so they can only access web APIs on behalf of the user. Anytime the source, or compiled bytecode of a given app, is transmitted anywhere it can be read, disassembled, or otherwise inspected by untrusted parties. As they also only support public client flows and can't hold configuration-time secrets, they can't have client secrets.

* **Confidential client applications** run on servers, such as web apps, web API apps, or service/daemon apps. They're considered difficult to access by users or attackers, and therefore can adequately hold configuration-time secrets to assert proof of its identity. The client ID is exposed through the web browser, but the secret is passed only in the back channel and never directly exposed.
