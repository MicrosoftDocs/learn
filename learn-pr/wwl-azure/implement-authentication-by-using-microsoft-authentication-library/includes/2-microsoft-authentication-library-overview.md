The Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL) can be used to provide secure access to Microsoft Graph, other Microsoft APIs, or your own web API. MSAL supports many different application architectures and platforms including .NET, JavaScript, Java, Python, Android, and iOS.

MSAL gives you many ways to get tokens, with a consistent API for many platforms. Using MSAL provides the following benefits:

* No need to directly use the OAuth libraries or code against the protocol in your application.
* Acquires tokens on behalf of a user or on behalf of an application (when applicable to the platform).
* Maintains a token cache and refreshes tokens for you when they're close to expire. You don't need to handle token expiration on your own.
* Helps you specify which audience you want your application to sign in.
* Helps you set up your application from configuration files.
* Helps you troubleshoot your app by exposing actionable exceptions, logging, and telemetry.

 ## Application types and scenarios

Within MSAL, a token can be acquired from many application types: web applications, web APIs, single-page apps (JavaScript), mobile and native applications, and daemons and server-side applications. MSAL currently supports the platforms and frameworks listed in the following table.

| Library | Supported platforms and frameworks |
|--|--|
| [MSAL for Android](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-android) | Android |
| [MSAL Angular](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js/tree/dev/lib/msal-angular) | Single-page apps with Angular and Angular.js frameworks |
| [MSAL for iOS and macOS](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-objc) | iOS and macOS |
| [MSAL Go (Preview)](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-go) | Windows, macOS, Linux |
| [MSAL Java](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-java) | Windows, macOS, Linux |
| [MSAL.js](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js/tree/dev/lib/msal-browser) | JavaScript/TypeScript frameworks such as Vue.js, Ember.js, or Durandal.js |
| [MSAL.NET](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-dotnet) | .NET Framework, .NET Core, Xamarin Android, Xamarin iOS, Universal Windows Platform |
| [MSAL Node](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js/tree/dev/lib/msal-node) | Web apps with Express, desktop apps with Electron, Cross-platform console apps |
| [MSAL Python](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-python) | Windows, macOS, Linux |
| [MSAL React](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js/tree/dev/lib/msal-react) | Single-page apps with React and React-based libraries (Next.js, Gatsby.js) |

## Authentication flows

The following table shows some of the different authentication flows provided by Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL). These flows can be used in various application scenarios.

| Flow | Description |
|--|--|
| Authorization code | Native and web apps securely obtain tokens in the name of the user |
| Client credentials | Service applications run without user interaction |
| On-behalf-of | The application calls a service/web API, which in turns calls Microsoft Graph |
| Implicit | Used in browser-based applications |
| Device code | Enables sign-in to a device by using another device that has a browser |
| Integrated Windows | Windows computers silently acquire an access token when they're domain joined |
| Interactive | Mobile and desktops applications call Microsoft Graph in the name of a user |
| Username/password | The application signs in a user by using their username and password | 

### Public client, and confidential client applications

Multiple types of applications can acquire security tokens. These applications tend to be separated into the following two categories. Each is used with different libraries and objects.

* **Public client applications**: Are apps that run on devices or desktop computers or in a web browser. They're not trusted to safely keep application secrets, so they only access web APIs on behalf of the user. (They support only public client flows.) Public clients can't hold configuration-time secrets, so they don't have client secrets.

* **Confidential client applications**: Are apps that run on servers (web apps, web API apps, or even service/daemon apps). They're considered difficult to access, and for that reason capable of keeping an application secret. Confidential clients can hold configuration-time secrets. Each instance of the client has a distinct configuration (including client ID and client secret).
