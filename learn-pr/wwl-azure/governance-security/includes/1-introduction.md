This module focuses on enabling administrators to effectively plan, implement, and manage security governance in Azure, ensuring compliance with organizational policies and best practices.

## Scenario

Imagine you are a security administrator responsible for maintaining the security posture of your organization's Azure environment. Your organization relies on Azure for critical workloads, and you need to establish robust governance practices to protect sensitive data and maintain regulatory compliance.

## Learning objectives

By the end of this module, participants will be able to:

 -  Create, assign, and interpret security policies and initiatives in Azure Policy to enforce compliance and security standards.
 -  Configure security settings using Azure Blueprint to streamline the deployment of secure infrastructures.
 -  Deploy secure infrastructures using a landing zone to ensure consistent and secure Azure environments.
 -  Create and configure an Azure Key Vault to securely manage certificates, secrets, and keys.
 -  Provide recommendations on when to use a dedicated Hardware Security Module (HSM) for enhanced key management security.
 -  Configure access to Key Vault, including vault access policies and Azure Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), to control permissions effectively.
 -  Manage certificates, secrets, and keys within Azure Key Vault for secure storage and distribution.
 -  Configure key rotation to enhance security by regularly updating cryptographic keys.
 -  Implement backup and recovery processes for certificates, secrets, and keys to ensure data resilience and availability.

## Goals

The module aims to equip participants with the knowledge and skills necessary to establish and manage governance practices for security in Azure. Participants will be able to enforce security policies, configure secure infrastructures, manage cryptographic keys securely, and implement backup and recovery measures, ultimately enhancing the security posture and compliance of their Azure environments.
