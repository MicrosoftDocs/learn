  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "What can be managed within an Azure Key Vault?"
    choices:
    - content: "Virtual machine sizes and configurations."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Vault is not involved in managing VM sizes or configurations. It's focused on cryptographic keys and secrets management."
    - content: "Certificates, secrets, and encryption keys."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Key Vault is specifically designed for securely storing and accessing secrets, keys, and certificates, providing a centralized management solution for these sensitive data."
    - content: "Networking equipment configurations."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Key Vault manages cryptographic keys and secrets, not network configurations."
  - content: "What is the primary function of Azure Policy?"
    choices:
    - content: "To enhance network speed and efficiency."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Azure Policy does not directly affect network speed or efficiency. Its main role is governance and compliance."
    - content: "To provide unlimited storage capacity for any Azure service."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Azure Policy focuses on governance and compliance, not on providing storage solutions."
    - content: "To create, assign, and manage governance policies for Azure resources."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Azure Policy is used to enforce organizational standards and assess compliance at scale, ensuring resources conform to corporate policies and regulatory requirements."
  - content: "How do Azure Blueprints help in configuring security settings?"
    choices:
    - content: "By deploying pre-configured templates that include security settings."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Azure Blueprints automate the deployment of resources, including security policies, RBAC settings, and ARM templates, ensuring a consistent and compliant environment."
    - content: "By manually managing each resource individually."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Blueprints provide automation for deployment, not manual management."
    - content: "By automatically scaling resources based on demand."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Blueprints focus on governance and compliance, not on resource scaling."
  - content: "How is key rotation configured in Azure Key Vault?"
    choices:
    - content: "By manually updating keys at each use."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Manual updates do not adhere to best practices for key rotation, which requires a more automated and reliable method."
    - content: "Using physical security mechanisms."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Key rotation is a digital process that involves updating cryptographic keys at specified intervals, not related to physical security."
    - content: "Through automatic rotation policies."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Azure Key Vault supports configuring automatic key rotation policies, enhancing security by regularly updating cryptographic keys without manual intervention."
  - content: "What is the purpose of a dedicated Hardware Security Module (HSM)?"
    choices:
    - content: "To serve as an external backup device for Azure services."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "HSMs are focused on securing cryptographic keys and performing secure cryptographic operations, not serving as backup devices."
    - content: "To enhance security by physically protecting cryptographic keys."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Dedicated HSMs provide a high level of security for cryptographic operations and key management by physically isolating and protecting keys from unauthorized access."
    - content: "To provide a physical computing device for processing graphical data."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "HSMs are designed for securing cryptographic keys, not for processing graphical data."
