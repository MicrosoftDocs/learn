Ensuring the health and performance of a platform requires continuous tracking and measurement of key metrics, along with a robust system for monitoring and alerting. For instance, in the scenario of a platform experiencing slowdowns after a major update, monitoring metrics like response times, CPU usage, and error rates can help identify whether these slowdowns are related to infrastructure issues, application performance, or user experience. Tools like **Azure Monitor** and **Application Insights** can be used to collect and visualize these metrics in real time. Azure Monitor provides a unified view of infrastructure health, while Application Insights focuses on application-level performance metrics.

### Identifying Key Metrics for Platform Health

Key metrics are essential for understanding the health and performance of the platform. Infrastructure metrics such as CPU utilization, memory usage, disk I/O, and network bandwidth provide insights into the platform’s resource consumption, helping engineers detect bottlenecks or potential system failures. **Azure Monitor** can be used to gather these infrastructure metrics, providing a centralized location for data from virtual machines, databases, storage, and network resources. These metrics offer a real-time view of the system’s capacity and health.

Application metrics focus on user-facing performance and system reliability. Metrics like request counts, response times, error rates, and uptime are critical in tracking how well the platform is performing in real-time. With **Application Insights**, platform teams can gather detailed application-level metrics that track requests, exceptions, response times, and dependency performance, helping to pinpoint the root cause of issues affecting user-facing services. These metrics allow teams to identify issues affecting the platform’s ability to serve requests, monitor service health, and take preemptive actions to prevent downtime or slow performance.

For developers, developer experience metrics are as important. Metrics like build times, deployment durations, incident frequency, and developer satisfaction help gauge how well the platform supports the development process. Tools such as **Azure DevOps** provide insights into the CI/CD pipeline, offering metrics on build and deployment durations. These tools also help identify areas where the development process can be streamlined or automated. Tracking these metrics ensures that both the platform’s operational performance and its developer experience are optimized.

### Monitoring and Alerting

Effective monitoring and alerting are key to proactive platform management. Setting thresholds and alerts for critical metrics allows teams to respond to potential issues before they escalate. For example, an alert might be triggered when CPU usage exceeds 90%, indicating that the system is under strain and could fail without intervention. With **Azure Alerts**, teams can set dynamic thresholds based on historical data or predefined limits, ensuring that notifications are accurate and actionable.

Alert management is crucial for handling the different levels of urgency in incidents. Defining alert severity levels—such as critical, warning, and informational—helps ensure that teams prioritize their response appropriately. **Azure Monitor** provides the ability to create multi-level alerts based on metric thresholds, and **Action Groups** allow for the routing of alerts to the right teams based on severity. For instance, critical alerts may warrant immediate attention, while informational alerts could be logged for review during regular platform reviews. Alert routing, based on severity, ensures that the right team is notified of the issue, improving response times and minimizing downtime.

Additionally, automated remediation is an important part of the incident management process, which will be covered in more detail in the next unit. For common issues, such as high CPU usage or failed deployments, automated responses like auto-scaling or rolling back deployments can be configured to mitigate the impact of an incident.

### Proactive Monitoring

Synthetic monitoring plays a key role in proactive monitoring by simulating user interactions with the platform. These simulated tests can be configured to run periodically and identify performance issues before real users experience them. For example, **Azure Synthetic Monitoring**, which is integrated with **Application Insights**, can simulate user journeys such as logging in or performing a transaction, providing insight into how the platform performs under different conditions. This allows teams to resolve potential issues before they impact the end-user experience.

On the other hand, Real User Monitoring (RUM) provides data based on actual user interactions with the platform. **Azure Application Insights** also supports RUM, offering detailed telemetry on user behavior, page load times, session data, and encountered errors. By tracking how real users engage with the platform, RUM helps teams understand the real-world performance of their services and features. It captures data on user behavior, page load times, and any errors encountered, which can highlight areas for improvement. Using RUM with synthetic monitoring allows teams to have a comprehensive view of both proactive and reactive platform performance, ensuring that they can act quickly to maintain an optimal user experience.
