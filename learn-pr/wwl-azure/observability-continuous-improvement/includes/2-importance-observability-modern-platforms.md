In platform engineering, continuous improvement is critical to delivering reliable, scalable, and high-performing systems. While observability often serves as a safety net for catching issues before they escalate, its true value lies in enabling teams to optimize systems proactively. For instance, after a deployment, analyzing telemetry might reveal inefficiencies such as recurring high CPU usage during specific workflows. Addressing these findings can lead to optimizations that improve platform performance and prevent future issues.

### What is Observability?

Observability is the ability to gain insights into a system’s internal state based on its external outputs. These outputs form three pillars of observability: metrics, logs, and traces, with each providing distinct yet complementary views of the observed system's behavior. Metrics offer quantitative data, such as CPU usage, response times, or request rates, which help teams assess system health. Logs provide detailed information about events, errors, and system behaviors, enabling teams to trace issues back to specific actions or processes. Traces track the flow of requests through different components of the system, allowing teams to identify bottlenecks or performance issues across service boundaries. Together, these pillars form the foundation of effective observability, providing the necessary insights to diagnose problems, improve platform performance, and enhance the developer experience.

Observability extends beyond system performance and reliability; it also measures how effectively platform engineering meets its goals. This aligns with adopting a product mindset, where the focus is on ensuring the platform delivers value to internal development teams while achieving broader business objectives. Metrics enable platform engineers to demonstrate value through data, addressing potential skepticism about return on investments. Setting objectives and key results (OKRs) tied to measurable metrics provides clarity and helps refine goals over time. OKRs are a goal-setting framework designed to align teams and individuals with organizational priorities by combining objectives with specific, measurable outcomes. An **objective** defines _what_ you want to achieve—typically aspirational and motivational. The **key results**, on the other hand, outline _how_ you'll measure progress toward the objective.

For example, an objective might be "Improve developer onboarding experience," with key results such as "Reduce the median time to complete the first pull request from five days to two days" or "Achieve a Net User Satisfaction (NSAT) score of 90% among new developers." By using OKRs, platform engineering teams can create a shared focus, track progress effectively, and foster continuous improvement.

Key metrics to track include speed to business value (for example, onboarding time and CI process duration), software quality (for example, mean time to remediate and security issue resolution time), platform ease of use (for example, net user satisfaction), and ecosystem health (for example, team empowerment and engagement scores).

Additionally, metrics for software delivery performance, operational efficiency, and platform adoption can provide deeper insights into the health and success of your platform. For software delivery performance, metrics from the DevOps Research and Assessment (DORA) framework are valuable. These include change lead time (the time from code commitment to deployment), deployment frequency, change fail rate (the percentage of changes resulting in failure), and mean time to restore service (MTTR) after an incident. These metrics provide a clear picture of how efficiently and reliably software is being delivered.

For operational efficiency, important metrics include MTTR, mean time between failures (MTBF), average time to acknowledge incidents, and key end-customer metrics such as availability, latency, and throughput. Additionally, cost metrics like cost per team or cost per deployment help assess resource efficiency and overall value.

Platform capability adoption metrics focus on how widely and effectively the platform is being utilized. Examples include the number of teams or developers using specific tools or features over time, the percentage of repositories adopting the platform, and the popularity of templates, pipelines, or other platform components. Tracking these metrics not only demonstrates platform impact but also highlights opportunities for further enhancement and growth.

To effectively support applications and infrastructure, monitoring and auditing should span the entire technology stack but in the manner that is tailored to the needs of specific roles. Platform engineering and operations teams require dashboards that focus on infrastructure health and capacity, complete with actionable alerts. Developers, on the other hand, benefit from application-specific metrics, logs, traces, and customized dashboards that provide insights into both application and infrastructure performance. Balancing these needs is critical to avoid cognitive overload from excessive data or gaps caused by insufficient information.

Addressing these challenges involves adopting standards like OpenTelemetry for consistent logging and dashboard creation, ensuring efficient data processing. Access permissions should enable secure, role-specific visibility into logs and dashboards, using tools like Grafana for aggregated views and trusted access. Retention policies must balance cost and compliance by establishing clear defaults. Additionally, monitoring resource limits—such as Kubernetes cluster capacity—and defining key health metrics (for example, CPU, memory, network usage) with tools like Prometheus or Azure Container Insights ensures proactive management of shared resources. Alerting rules, stored as code, further support automated and scalable observability practices. Tools like Azure Application Insights can streamline data collection, while regular surveys on platform usability and ecosystem health help guide continuous improvement and future development efforts.

### Key Benefits of Observability

The key benefits of observability are evident in improving platform reliability, enhancing the developer experience, and enabling faster incident response. First and foremost, observability enables improved reliability by offering visibility into system performance in real-time. This allows platform teams to identify and fix issues faster, reducing the impact of potential failures. With real-time access to metrics and logs, engineers can address problems before they escalate, ensuring that the platform remains stable and performs optimally.

Another significant benefit of observability is its contribution to a better developer experience. Developers benefit from the insights observability provides, as it enables them to troubleshoot and debug issues more effectively. If there's deployment failures, having access to logs, metrics, and traces allow developers to resolve the issue quickly, without needing to escalate it to the operations team. This empowers developers to work more efficiently, freeing them from dependencies on other teams and speeding up the development process.

Observability also leads to faster incident response. With a comprehensive monitoring system in place, platform teams can respond to issues in real-time, minimizing downtime and disruptions. Alerts based on predefined thresholds can notify the team as soon as issues arise, allowing them to take an immediate corrective action. The ability to monitor the system constantly and resolve issues quickly ensures that developers can focus on building new features instead of constantly firefighting platform issues, creating a more productive and efficient development environment.

### Continuous Improvement through Observability

Observability not only helps detect and resolve issues but also plays a critical role in continuous improvement. The data gathered from metrics, logs, and traces can be analyzed to uncover insights about system performance and identify areas for optimization. For instance, patterns in the logs might reveal recurring performance bottlenecks or inefficient resource utilization, which can then be addressed through platform enhancements. By using the insights from observability, platform teams can continuously refine and evolve the platform, ensuring it remains efficient, scalable, and adaptable to the needs of developers and end-users alike. By applying continuous improvement practices driven by observability, platform teams can foster an environment of ongoing platform evolution, ensuring that the system remains capable of handling growing user demands and new features.
