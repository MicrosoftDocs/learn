Intune provides several ways to monitor the compliance status of the apps that you've assigned to users or device in the **Apps** blade in the Microsoft Intune admin center. You can also find information about all assigned apps and determine which version of a given app that you've deployed. The following pages provide that information:

 -  **Apps** > **Overview** page
    
     -  List of all apps in Intune and assignment status. You can select an app to get detailed information about the assignments and install status.
 -  **Apps** > **Monitor** > **App licenses** page
    
     -  Lists apps from the Microsoft Store or Business. License information for the apps is shown in the list. You can select an app to get detailed information about the assignments and install status.

 -  **Apps** > **Monitor** > **Discovered apps** page
    
     -  Lists all apps discovered by Intune at the last Hardware Inventory time. For devices with Device Ownership marked as "Corporate", this will be all apps installed on the device. For devices with Device Ownership marked as "Personal", this will be all apps installed via the Intune Company Portal or apps installed in a Required deployment. The number of devices that a given app is installed on, is shown in the list. You can select an app to list the devices the app is installed on.
