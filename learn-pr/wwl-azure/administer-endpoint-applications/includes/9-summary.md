Apps managed by Intune are all deployed using the same overall process no matter what application type is being installed. From Intune, Administrators assign applications to users and groups, configure policies for deployment, and then monitor the results. For devices that aren't enrolled with Intune, device users must go to their organizations Company Portal and manually install apps and app updates that are made available by an organization’s administrator.

Microsoft 365 apps are already available within Intune and can be assigned to Windows client and macOS devices. Intune can manage and deploy Microsoft 365 apps, but you can also use Configuration Manager, the Office Deployment Tool, the Office Customization Tool, or even have end users install from the Microsoft 365 portal.

In Windows 11 and later, Microsoft Edge is the default browser experience. Microsoft Edge introduced a feature called IE Mode that allows Microsoft Edge to render legacy sites. Intune can be used to monitor the compliance status and version information of apps that have been assigned to users or devices in the Apps blade within the Microsoft Intune admin center.
