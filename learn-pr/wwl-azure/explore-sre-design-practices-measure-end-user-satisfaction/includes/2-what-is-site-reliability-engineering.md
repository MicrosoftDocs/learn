Software developers spend many time-chasing bugs and putting out production fires. Thanks to agile development, we're constantly shipping new code.

By-products of constant change are constant issues with performance, software defects, and other issues that eat up our time.

Web applications that receive even a modest amount of traffic require constant care and feeding. It includes overseeing deployments, monitoring overall performance, reviewing error logs, and troubleshooting software defects.

These tasks have traditionally been handled by a mixture of lead developers, development management, system administrators, and, more often than not, nobody. The problem is that these critical tasks lacked a clear owner until now.

Site reliability engineering (SRE) empowers software developers to own the ongoing daily operation of their applications in production.

The goal is to bridge the gap between the development team that wants to ship things as fast as possible and the operations team that doesn't want anything to blow up in production.

In many organizations, you could argue that site reliability engineering eliminates much of the IT operations workload related to application monitoring.

It shifts the responsibility to be part of the development team itself. *“Fundamentally, it's what happens when you ask a software engineer to design an operations function.”* – Niall Murphy, Google.

Site reliability engineers typically spend up to 50% of their time dealing with the daily care and feeding of software applications. They spend the rest of their time-writing code as any other software developer would.

A key skill of a software reliability engineer is that they have a deep understanding of the application, the code, and how it runs, is configured, and scales. That knowledge makes them so valuable at also monitoring and supporting it as a site reliability engineer.

Some of the typical responsibilities of a site reliability engineer:

 -  Proactively monitor and review application performance.
 -  Handle on-call and emergency support.
 -  Ensure software has good logging and diagnostics.
 -  Create and maintain operational runbooks.
 -  Help triage-escalated support tickets.
 -  Work on feature requests, defects, and other development tasks
 -  Contribute to the overall product roadmap.
 -  Do live site reviews and capture feedback for system outages.

The concept of site reliability engineering started in 2003 within Google.

As Google continued to grow and scale to become a massive company today, it found many-growing pains.

Their challenge was how to support large-scale systems while also introducing new features continuously.

To accomplish the goal, they created a new role that had the dual purpose of developing new features while also ensuring that production systems ran smoothly.

Site reliability engineering has grown significantly within Google, and most projects have site reliability engineers as part of the team. Google now has over 1,500 site reliability engineers.

## Site reliability engineering versus DevOps

So, I know what you are thinking. How does site reliability engineering compare to DevOps?

DevOps is a more recent movement designed to help organizations’ IT departments move agile and performant ways.

It builds a healthy-working relationship between the Operations staff and Dev team, allowing each to see how their work influences and affects the other.

By combining knowledge and effort, DevOps should produce a more robust, reliable, agile product.

Both SRE and DevOps are methodologies addressing organizations’ needs for production operation management.

But the differences between the two doctrines are significant: While DevOps raises problems and dispatches them to Dev to solve, the SRE approach is to find the issues and solve some of them themselves.

While DevOps teams would usually choose the more conservative approach, leaving the production environment untouched unless necessary, SREs are more confident in their ability to maintain a stable production environment and push for rapid changes and software updates.

Not unlike the DevOps team, SREs also thrive on a stable production environment, but one of the SRE team’s goals is to improve performance and operational efficiency.

For other companies like us born in the cloud and heavily use PaaS services, I believe they'll also see site reliability engineering as the missing element to their development team success.

I could see them using both DevOps and site reliability engineering for larger companies or companies that don't use the cloud.

DevOps practices can help ensure IT helps rack, stack, configure, and deploy the servers and applications.

The site reliability engineers can then handle the daily operation of the applications.

They also work as a fast feedback loop to the entire team about how the application does and runs in production.

## Site reliability engineering skills

The skills needed will vary wildly based on your type of application, how and where it's deployed, and how it's monitored.

For organizations using Serverless such as Azure PaaS, in-depth knowledge of Windows or Linux systems management isn't a priority.

However, it may be critical to teams if you're using servers for deployments.

The other key skills for a good site reliability engineer are more focused on application monitoring and diagnostics.

You want to hire people who are good problem solvers and have a knack for finding problems.

Experience with application performance management tools like App Insights, New Relic, and others would be valuable.

They should be well versed in application logging best practices and exception handling.

## The future of site reliability engineering

Software developers are increasingly taking a more significant role in deployments, production operations, and application monitoring.

The tools available today make it easy to deploy our applications and monitor them.

Things like PaaS and application monitoring solutions make it easy for developers to own their projects from ideation to production.

While IT operations will always exist in most medium to large enterprises.

Their work will continue to change because of the cloud, PaaS, containers, and other technologies.
