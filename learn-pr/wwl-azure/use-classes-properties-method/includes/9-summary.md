## Summary

In this module you took what you learned about classes, objects, methods and properties and put them to use. You learned how to instantiate a class that creates an in-memory object of your class. You also learned how to implement methods and properties in your class and the differences between the two. 

Methods are how objects interact with one another and and can do more than properties. Properties are how you can get and set specific values on an object. You also learned that while methods typically perform actions on an object, they can also be used to return a value or custom object. Finally, you learned about what the keyword `static` does to an object member, essentially making it globally available in your application.
