    - content: "'Custormer myCustomer = Customer (\"Customer Name\");'."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The \"new\" keyword is missing."
    - content: "'Custormer myCustomer = new Customer(\"Customer Name\");'."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! This answer is an accurate description of how an object can be instantiated."
  - content: "Which of these statements is the correct way to instantiate an object?"
    choices:
    - content: "'Custormer myCustomer = new Customer(string \"Customer Name\");'."
