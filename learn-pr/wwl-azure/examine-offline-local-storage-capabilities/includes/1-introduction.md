The Azure IoT Edge environment can be configured to support offline and local storage scenarios for situations when networks or device connections are not always available.

Suppose you have joined a team that is implementing an Azure IoT solution for the company. The company needs your team to develop custom solutions for IoT Edge devices using Azure IoT Edge technologies. Understanding the Azure IoT Edge environment's ability to support offline scenarios will help to prepare the team for their upcoming coding tasks. You decide to examine the offline and local storage capabilities enabled by Azure IoT Edge.

In this module, you will:

 -  Examine the extended offline capabilities.
 -  Examine local storage using Azure Blob storage.
 -  Examine module access to local storage.

By the end of this module, you will be able to describe the extended offline capabilities and local storage options that are available for the Azure IoT Edge environment.
