  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "Which of the following choices accurately describes Azure IoT Edge support for extended offline operations?"
    choices:
    - content: "Full support is provided for all versions of Azure IoT Edge."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Full support is provided for IoT Edge version 1.0.7 or higher, earlier versions have a subset of offline features."
    - content: "After an initial one-time sync with IoT Hub, IoT Edge devices can function indefinitely offline."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. IoT Edge devices can function indefinitely offline after the initial, one-time sync. However, storage of messages depends on the time to live (TTL) setting and the available disk space for storing the messages."
    - content: "The Time-to-Live setting is used to set the time interval that an offline device uses when attempting to reconnect with IoT Hub."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The time to live setting is the amount of time (in seconds) that a message can wait to be delivered before it expires."
  - content: "A developer for a company has discovered that they are losing data during periods when the local WiFi signal is lost and devices are offline. The developer investigates whether IoT Edge provides a solution for this problem. Which of the following answer choices accurately describes using Azure Blob Storage for IoT Edge devices?"
    choices:
    - content: "It uses a blob storage module to provide a block blob storage solution on your IoT Edge device."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. A blob storage module is used to provide a block blob storage solution for IoT Edge device and can be used for offline scenarios."
    - content: "It uses the IoT Edge hub module to provide a block blob storage solution on your IoT Edge device."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The IoT Edge hub module does not provide block blob storage resource."
    - content: "It uses IoT hub as the blob endpoint for any storage requests that are made by the IoT Edge device."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. IoT Hub does not provide a built-in blob storage endpoint for IoT Edge devices and is not accessible when the device is offline."
