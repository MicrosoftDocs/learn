  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "A developer has built a digital twins (graph) environment and they want to create some sample queries. They run the following query: `SELECT T, CT FROM DIGITALTWINS T JOIN CT RELATED T.rel_has_caves WHERE T.$dtId = 'factory_1'` Assuming that the query runs as expected, what results are returned?"
    choices:
    - content: "The \"cave\" digital twins that have a \"rel_has_caves\" relationship to the \"factory\" digital twin with an ID of \"factory_1\"."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The query will return the digital twin T that has an ID of \"factory_1\" in addition to the twins that meet the other requirements."
    - content: "The \"factory_1\" digital twin and all digital twins that are related to it."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The \"factory_1\" digital twin will be returned, but the other digital twins that are returned will be filtered by the specified requirements."
    - content: "The \"factory_1\" digital twin and all of the digital twins that have a \"rel_has_caves\" relationship to it."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The \"factory_1\" digital twin will be returned along with all of the digital twins that have a \"rel_has_caves\" relationship to it."
  - content: "A digital twins environment includes twins that support telemetry coming from IoT hub devices. Which Azure service should be used to ingest telemetry from the upstream IoT hub?"
    choices:
    - content: "Azure Device Provisioning Service"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The Azure IoT Hub Device Provisioning Service is used to deploy IoT devices, it does not provide the tools to ingest data from IoT Hub."
    - content: "Azure Function"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. An Azure Function is used to ingest telemetry (into ADT) from the upstream IoT hub."
    - content: "Azure Digital Twins Explorer"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The Azure Digital Twins Explorer is used to view and manage the graph, but does not provide the tools to ingest data from IoT Hub."
