  - content: "Which level of government addresses issues that are national or global in scope?"
    choices:
    - content: "Federal"

The National Government, also known as the United States Government (USG) or the Federal Government, provides for America's defense, conducts foreign affairs, and addresses issues that are national or global in scope.
