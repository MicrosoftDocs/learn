Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) is Microsoft’s cloud-based identity and access management service, which helps your employee's sign in and access resources in:

 -  External resources, such as Microsoft 365, the Azure portal, and thousands of other SaaS applications.
 -  Internal resources, such as apps on your corporate network and intranet, along with any cloud apps developed by your own organization.

 -  Create users, groups, and administrative units to securely access resources and services.
