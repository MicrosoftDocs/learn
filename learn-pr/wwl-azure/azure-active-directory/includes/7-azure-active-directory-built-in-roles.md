In Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), if another administrator or nonadministrator needs to manage Azure AD resources, you assign them an Azure AD role that provides the permissions they need. For example, you can assign roles to allow adding or changing users, resetting user passwords, managing user licenses, or managing domain names.

| External Identity Provider Administrator                                            | This administrator manages federation between Azure AD organizations and external identity providers. With this role, users can add new identity providers and configure all available settings (for example, authentication path, service ID, assigned key containers). This user can enable the Azure AD organization to trust authentications from external identity providers. The resulting impact on end-user experiences depends on the type of organization:<br><br>\-Azure AD organizations for employees and partners: The addition of a federation (for example, with Gmail) immediately impacts all guest invitations not yet redeemed. See Adding Google as an identity provider for B2B guest users.<br><br>\-Azure Active Directory B2C organizations: The addition of a federation (for example, with Facebook, or with another Azure AD organization) doesn't immediately impact end-user flows until the identity provider is added as an option in a user flow (also called a built-in policy).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

Furthermore, Global Administrators can elevate their access to manage all Azure subscriptions and management groups. This allows Global Administrators to get full access to all Azure resources using the respective Azure AD Tenant. The person who signs up for the Azure AD organization becomes a Global Administrator. There can be more than one Global Administrator at your company. Global Administrators can reset the password for any user and all other administrators.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

Additionally, this role contains the ability to manage users and devices in order to associate policy and create and manage groups.<br>This role can create and manage security groups, but doesn't have administrator rights over Microsoft 365 groups. That means administrators can't update owners or memberships of Microsoft 365 groups in the organization.
