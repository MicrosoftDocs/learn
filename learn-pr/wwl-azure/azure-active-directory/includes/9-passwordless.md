Sign-in without ever using a password. With passwordless, the password is replaced with something you have plus something you are or something you know. For example, Windows Hello for Business can use a biometric gesture like a face or fingerprint or a device-specific personal identification number (PIN) that isn't transmitted over a network.

## Passwordless authentication methods

 -  **Windows Hello for Business** \- biometric and PIN credentials are directly tied to the user's PC, which prevents access from anyone other than the owner.
 -  **Fast Identity Online (FIDO) 2 Security Keys** \- generally stored on a Universal Serial Bus (USB) stick, FIDO2 security keys are an unphishable standards-based passwordless authentication method that can come in any form factor.
 -  **Microsoft Authenticator App** \- Authenticator App turns any iOS or Android phone into a strong, passwordless credential. Users can sign in to any platform or browser by getting a notification to their phone, matching a number displayed on the screen to the one on their phone, and then using their biometric (touch or face) or PIN to confirm.
 -  **FIDO2 Smartcards (preview)** \- new method to use FIDO2 keys for passwordless login via a smartcard.
 -  **Temporary Access Pass (preview)** \- time-limited passcode allows you to set up security keys and the Microsoft Authenticator without ever needing to use, much less know, your password!
