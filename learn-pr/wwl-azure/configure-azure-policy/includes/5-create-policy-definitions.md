There are many Built-in Policy Definitions for you to choose from. Sorting by Category will help you locate what you need. For example,

 -  The Allowed Virtual Machine SKUs enables you to specify a set of virtual machine SKUs that your organization can deploy.
 -  The Allowed Locations policy enables you to restrict the locations that your organization can specify when deploying resources. The Allowed Locations policy can be used to enforce your geo-compliance requirements.
