quiz:
  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "In your scenario, what components does the Hyper-V host require to replicate your VMs to Azure?"
    choices:
    - content: "Mobility service, Azure Site Recovery provider, Registration key file"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The Mobility service is used for agent-based migration and is installed on the machines you want to replicate. Your scenario is for agentless migration, so nothing needs to be installed on the Hyper-V VMs."
    - content: "Azure Site Recovery provider, Azure Site Recovery agent, Registration key file"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. All three components are required by the Hyper-V host for replicating VMs to Azure."
    - content: "Registration appliance, Registration key file, Azure Site Recovery agent"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The registration appliance is used for agent-based migration. However, your scenario is for agentless migration."
  - content: "During replication, where does the replication provider upload the replicated data from the on-premises Hyper-V VMs?"
    choices:
    - content: "Azure Key Vault"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Azure Key Vault is used to manage access keys to the replication storage account when doing an agentless migration of VMware VMs."
    - content: "Hyper-V replica disks"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The Server Migration tool the processes the replicated data, and applies it to replica disks in the subscription. However, the replicated data is first uploaded to an Azure storage account."
    - content: "Azure storage account"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Replicated data is uploaded to an Azure storage account."
