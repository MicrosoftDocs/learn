  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "Which of the following choices is a step in the high-level deployment process for IoT Edge modules?"
    choices:
    - content: "Remove the device identities from the IoT Hub registry."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Removing the device from the IoT Hub registry would prevent the device from connection to IoT hub until it is reprovisioned."
    - content: "Reprovision the devices after configuration."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Devices do not need to be reprovisioned when a module is deployed to an IoT Edge device."
    - content: "Retrieve the status of the devices after configuration."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Retrieving the status of the devices after configuration helps to verify that the module deployed successfully."
  - content: "What is an IoT Edge deployment manifest used for?"
    choices:
    - content: "It tells your device which modules to install and how to configure them to work together."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The deployment manifest is a JSON document that tells your device which modules to install and how to configure them to work together."
    - content: "It tells your device to forward authentication requests to IoT Hub when a device first tries to connect."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Forwarding authentication requests to IoT Hub when a device first tries to connect is a function of the Edge Hub module."
    - content: "It is a report that an IoT Edge device sends to IoT Hub indicating the status of instantiated modules."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The IoT Edge agent is responsible for instantiating modules, ensuring that they continue to run, and reporting back to IoT Hub. The report sent by the IoT Edge agent is not the deployment manifest."
