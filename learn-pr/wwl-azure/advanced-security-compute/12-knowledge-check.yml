  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "Which feature is essential for monitoring the security of Azure Container Instances (ACIs)?"
    choices:
    - content: "Azure Monitor"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Azure Monitor provides comprehensive monitoring capabilities, allowing for the detection of security issues and performance anomalies in ACIs."
    - content: "Ignoring all security alerts"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Ignoring security alerts can lead to undetected threats and vulnerabilities within containerized applications."
    - content: "Disabling diagnostic logs"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Disabling diagnostic logs reduces visibility into the operational health and security posture of container instances, hindering incident response."
  - content: "What enables secure remote access to Azure VMs without exposing them to the public internet?"
    choices:
    - content: "Unrestricted access through any internet connection"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Exposing VMs directly via public IP addresses increases vulnerability to attacks."
    - content: "Azure Bastion"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Azure Bastion provides secure, seamless RDP/SSH access within the Azure portal over SSL, eliminating the need for public IP addresses on VMs."
    - content: "Direct access using public IP addresses"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Unrestricted access poses significant security risks by potentially exposing sensitive systems to malicious actors."
  - content: "What best practice secures access to Azure Container Registry (ACR)?"
    choices:
    - content: "Integration with Microsoft Entra ID and RBAC"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Integrating ACR with Microsoft Entra ID and using RBAC ensures that access is securely managed based on user roles and responsibilities."
    - content: "Using a single, shared administrator account for all users"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "A single shared administrator account contradicts the principle of least privilege and increases the risk of accidental or malicious misuse."
    - content: "Public access with no authentication"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Public access without authentication would allow anyone to access and potentially compromise stored container images."
  - content: "What encryption method is recommended for securing data at rest on Azure VMs?"
    choices:
    - content: "Using plain text files for sensitive data storage"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Storing sensitive data in plain text files significantly increases the risk of data breaches and unauthorized access."
    - content: "Azure Disk Encryption using BitLocker or dm-crypt"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Azure Disk Encryption leverages BitLocker (Windows) and dm-crypt (Linux) to securely encrypt virtual machine disks, protecting data at rest."
    - content: "Manual encryption methods implemented at the application layer"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "While application layer encryption can be part of a security strategy, it should not replace disk-level encryption for comprehensive data protection."
  - content: "How is network isolation achieved in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)?"
    choices:
    - content: "By disabling network policies"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Disabling network policies would remove the mechanisms that restrict and control pod communication, reducing security."
    - content: "Through unrestricted ingress and egress rules"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Unrestricted ingress and egress rules would allow all types of traffic, negating the benefits of network isolation."
    - content: "Using network policies to control ingress and egress traffic"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Network policies in AKS enable administrators to define rules that govern ingress and egress traffic to pods, enhancing security."
