  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "An administrator is provisioning Windows Server VMs in Azure. They upload a specialized VM image as a generalized image. What is likely to happen when they perform this task?"
    choices:
    - content: "The administrator will receive a provisioning failure error with the VM stuck at the OOBE screen because the new VM is running with the original computer name, username and password."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The administrator will receive this error."
    - content: "The administrator receives no error and is able to complete the task."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Upload or capture of a specialized VM image as a generalized image causes a provisioning failure and an error is displayed."
    - content: "The administrator receives a provisioning timeout error because the original VM is not usable as it is marked as generalized."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Timeout errors result when an administrator uploads or captures a generalized VM image as a specialized image."
  - content: "An administrator attempts to connect remotely to a VM for performing a management task. They are unable to establish an RDP connection. What should the administrator do next?"
    choices:
    - content: "Restart their administrative computer."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This is unlikely to have any impact on the problem."
    - content: "Deploy and configure Azure Bastion."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Although deploying Azure Bastion is a good solution in helping to secure remote connectivity to the VM, it's not a solution to the current problem."
    - content: "Verify and test the RDP connection details being used to connect to the target VM."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. It's possible the details have changed."
  - content: "An administrator has received an error when they started a Windows Server VM. They've no idea why the VM won't start. What should they do first to determine the cause of the startup failure?"
    choices:
    - content: "Review boot diagnostics."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Boot diagnostics displays a screenshot of the failed startup. This could be crucial in determining next steps."
    - content: "Connect to the VM with RDP."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The VM must be operational for RDP connectivity."
    - content: "Connect to the VM with the Azure Serial Console."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This is a potentially useful step, but it's important to know why a VM failed to start first."
