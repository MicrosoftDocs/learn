As with on-premises physical servers, you’ll occasionally encounter problems with your Azure-hosted Windows Server virtual machines (VMs). In some respects, the approach you take to troubleshoot Azure-hosted VMs is similar to the approach you take in an on-premises context. However, in other respects, there are some crucial differences. For example, if a hosted VM doesn’t startup, you don’t have the same physical access to the device as in your on-premises datacenter. In addition, if you’re connecting to a hosted VM, there are often other security considerations, such as just-in-time access and Azure Bastion; these features help secure access to your VMs, but if configured incorrectly, can make access difficult or impossible. In this module, you’ll learn to troubleshoot Azure-hosted Windows Server VM startup, connectivity, extensions, and performance. You’ll also learn how to troubleshoot storage and encryption.

In this module, you will:

- Learn how to troubleshoot Windows Server VM deployment in Azure.
