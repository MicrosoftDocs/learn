Azure Container Apps provides built-in authentication and authorization features to secure your external ingress-enabled container app with minimal or no code. The built-in authentication feature for Container Apps can save you time and effort by providing out-of-the-box authentication with federated identity providers, allowing you to focus on the rest of your application.

* Azure Container Apps provides access to various built-in authentication providers.
* The built-in auth features donâ€™t require any particular language, SDK, security expertise, or even any code that you have to write.

This feature should only be used with HTTPS. Ensure `allowInsecure` is disabled on your container app's ingress configuration. You can configure your container app for authentication with or without restricting access to your site content and APIs.

* To restrict app access only to authenticated users, set its *Restrict access* setting to **Require authentication**.
* To authenticate but not restrict access, set its *Restrict access* setting to **Allow unauthenticated** access.

## Identity providers

Container Apps uses federated identity, in which a third-party identity provider manages the user identities and authentication flow for you. The following identity providers are available by default:

| Provider | Sign-in endpoint | How-To guidance |
|---|---|---|
| Microsoft Identity Platform | `/.auth/login/aad` | [Microsoft Identity Platform](/azure/container-apps/authentication-azure-active-directory) |
| Facebook | `/.auth/login/facebook` | [Facebook](/azure/container-apps/authentication-facebook) |
| GitHub | `/.auth/login/github` | [GitHub](/azure/container-apps/authentication-github) |
| Google | `/.auth/login/google` | [Google](/azure/container-apps/authentication-google) |
| Twitter | `/.auth/login/twitter` | [Twitter](/azure/container-apps/authentication-twitter) |
| Any OpenID Connect provider | `/.auth/login/<providerName>` | [OpenID Connect](/azure/container-apps/authentication-openid) |

When you use one of these providers, the sign-in endpoint is available for user authentication and authentication token validation from the provider. You can provide your users with any number of these provider options.

## Feature architecture

The authentication and authorization middleware component is a feature of the platform that runs as a sidecar container on each replica in your application. When enabled, every incoming HTTP request passes through the security layer before being handled by your application.

The platform middleware handles several things for your app:

* Authenticates users and clients with the specified identity provider(s)
* Manages the authenticated session
* Injects identity information into HTTP request headers

The authentication and authorization module runs in a separate container, isolated from your application code. As the security container doesn't run in-process, no direct integration with specific language frameworks is possible. However, relevant information your app needs is provided in request headers.

## Authentication flow

The authentication flow is the same for all providers, but differs depending on whether you want to sign in with the provider's SDK:

* **Without provider SDK** (server-directed flow or server flow): The application delegates federated sign-in to Container Apps. Delegation is typically the case with browser apps, which presents the provider's sign-in page to the user.

* **With provider SDK** (client-directed flow or client flow): The application signs users in to the provider manually and then submits the authentication token to Container Apps for validation. This approach is typical for browser-less apps that don't present the provider's sign-in page to the user. An example is a native mobile app that signs users in using the provider's SDK.
