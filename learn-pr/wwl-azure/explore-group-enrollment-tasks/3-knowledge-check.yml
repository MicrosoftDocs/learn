  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "The Device Provisioning Service uses X.509 certificates to help ensure that device connections are secure. What type of certificate is used to verify proof of possession for the root certificate?"
    choices:
    - content: "A leaf certificate."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A leaf certificate is the end-entity certificate that is used to validate a device."
    - content: "An intermediate certificate."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Intermediate certificates are used to validate leaf certificates or other intermediate certificates."
    - content: "A verification certificate."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. A verification certificate, which is created by using the root certificate and a DPS-generated verification code, is used to establish proof of possession."
  - content: "What needs to be completed in order to deprovision a single device from a group enrollment?"
    choices:
    - content: "Disable or delete the device from the IoT hub's identity registry."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This action does not prevent the device from being reprovisioned as part of the group enrollment."
    - content: "Create a disabled individual enrollment for the device's leaf certificate, disable or delete the device from the IoT hub's identity registry, and then delete the disabled individual enrollment for the device."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Deleting the disabled enrollment for the device would allow the device to re-enroll through the enrollment group."
    - content: "Create a disabled individual enrollment for the device's leaf certificate and then disable or delete the device from the IoT hub's identity registry."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The disabled individual enrollment blocks DPS from reprovisioning the device and deleting or disabling the device from IoT Hub prevents the device from connecting to the IoT hub."
