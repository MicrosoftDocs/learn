## Scenario

In this lab, you'll learn how to use an Azure DevOps CI/CD pipeline to build a custom Docker image, push it to Azure Container Registry, and deploy it as a container to Azure App Service.

## Objectives

After completing this lab, you'll be able to:

 -  Build a custom Docker image by using a Microsoft hosted Linux agent.
 -  Push an image to Azure Container Registry.
 -  Deploy a Docker image as a container to Azure App Service using Azure DevOps.

## Requirements

 -  This lab requires **Microsoft Edge** or an [Azure DevOps-supported browser](/azure/devops/server/compatibility).
