Data storage for an IoT solution involves a combination of short and long-term storage.

Suppose you have joined a team that is implementing an Azure IoT solution for the company. Your team will be implementing device message processing in support of data analytics and other downstream requirements. Understanding the rationale behind various data storage options will help to ensure that message and event data is retained in an appropriate repository. You decide to examine Azure storage options for both hot and cold data paths.

In this module, you will:

 -  Examine the lambda architecture for data storage.
 -  Review Azure storage options commonly implemented with IoT solutions.
 -  Examine the features provided by specific Azure storage options.

By the end of this module, you will be able to describe the hot and cold storage path options for an Azure IoT solution.
