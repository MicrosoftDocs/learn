title: Configure Azure Blob Storage
summary: |
  Learn how to configure Configure Azure Blob Storage, including tiers and object replication.
abstract: |
  In this module, you learn how to:
  - Understand the purpose and benefits of Azure Blob Storage.
  - Create and configure Azure Blob Storage accounts.
  - Manage containers and blobs within Azure Blob Storage.
  - Optimize blob storage performance and scalability.
  - Implement lifecycle management policies to automate data movement and deletion.
  - Determine the best pricing plans for your Azure Blob Storage.
prerequisites: |
  *   Basic understanding of cloud computing. Familiarity with cloud computing concepts, such as virtualization, scalability, and pay-as-you-go pricing models, can provide a foundation for understanding how Azure Blob Storage fits into the broader cloud ecosystem.
  *   Knowledge of Azure fundamentals. Having a basic understanding of Microsoft Azure services and concepts, such as Azure Resource Manager, Azure Storage Accounts, and Azure Virtual Networks, can help you navigate and configure blob storage effectively.
  *   Familiarity with storage concepts. Understanding fundamental storage concepts like file systems, directories, files, and data replication can be beneficial when working with blob storage.
  *   Experience with Azure portal or Azure CLI. Familiarity with the Azure portal (web-based management interface) or Azure CLI (command-line interface) can help you navigate and configure blob storage resources efficiently.
  *   Basic programming or scripting skills. While not always required, having some knowledge of programming or scripting languages like Azure PowerShell can be advantageous when automating blob storage configuration tasks.
