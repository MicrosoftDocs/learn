Azure Blob storage is a service that stores unstructured data in the cloud as objects/blobs. Blob storage can store any type of text or binary data, such as a document, media file, or application installer. Blob storage is also referred to as object storage.

Common uses of Blob storage include:

 -  Serving images or documents directly to a browser.
 -  Storing files for distributed access, such as installation.
 -  Streaming video and audio.
 -  Storing data for backup and restore, disaster recovery, and archiving.
 -  Storing data for analysis by an on-premises or Azure-hosted service.

## Blob service resources

Blob storage offers three types of resources:

 -  The storage account
 -  Containers in the storage account
 -  Blobs in a container

The following diagram shows the relationship between these resources.
