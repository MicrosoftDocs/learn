Azure Blob Storage is an AI-ready service for storing large amounts of unstructured object data. Unstructured data is data that doesn't adhere to a particular data model or definition, such as text or binary data. 

In this module, your media company has an extensive library of video clips that are accessed thousands of times a day. The company relies on you to configure Blob Storage for the video data. You plan to use access tiers to reduce cost and improve performance. You're developing a lifecycle management strategy for the older videos. Your plan also includes configuring object replication for failover.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you will:

- Understand the purpose and benefits of Azure Blob Storage.
- Create and configure Azure Blob Storage accounts.
- Manage containers and blobs within Azure Blob Storage.
- Optimize blob storage performance and scalability.
- Implement lifecycle management policies to automate data movement and deletion.
- Determine the best pricing plans for your Azure Blob Storage.
