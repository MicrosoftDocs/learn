[Azure Information Protection](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/information-protection/what-is-information-protection?azure-portal=true) is a cloud-based solution that helps organizations classify and (optionally) protect its documents and emails by applying labels. Labels can be applied automatically (by administrators who define rules and conditions), manually (by users), or with a combination of both (where users are guided by recommendations).

**Usage scenario**

The following screen capture is an example of MSIP in action on a user's computer. In this example, the administrator has configured a label with rules that detect sensitive data. When a user saves a Microsoft Word document containing a credit card number, a custom tooltip is displayed. The tooltip recommends labeling the file as *Confidential/ All Employees*, which is a label that the administrator has configured. This label classifies the document and protects it.

After your content is classified (and optionally protected), you can then track and control how the content is used. For example, you can analyze data flows to gain insight into your business; detect risky behaviors and take corrective measures; track access to documents; and prevent data leakage or misuse.
