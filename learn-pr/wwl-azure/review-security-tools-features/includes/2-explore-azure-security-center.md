[Azure Security Center](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/security-center?azure-portal=true)  is a monitoring service that provides threat protection across all of your services both in Azure, and on-premises. Security Center can:

+ Provide security recommendations based on your configurations, resources, and networks.
+ Monitor security settings across on-premises and cloud workloads, and automatically apply required security to new services as they come online.
+ Continuously monitor all your services and perform automatic security assessments to identify potential vulnerabilities before they can be exploited.
+ Use machine learning to detect and block malware from being installed on your virtual machines and services. You can also define a list of allowed applications to ensure that only the apps you validate can execute.
+ Analyze and identify potential inbound attacks and help to investigate threats and any post-breach activity that might have occurred.
+ Provide just-in-time access control for ports, reducing your attack surface by ensuring the network only allows traffic that you require.


**Azure Security Center versions**

Azure Security Center is available in two tiers:

+ **Free**. Available as part of your Azure subscription, this tier is limited to assessments and recommendations of Azure resources only.
+ **Standard**. This tier provides a full suite of security-related services including continuous monitoring, threat detection, just-in-time access control for ports, and more.

To access the full suite of Azure Security Center services you will need to upgrade to a Standard tier subscription. You can access the 30-day free trial from within the Azure Security Center dashboard in the Azure portal.
