Azure has out-of-the-box help for a great deal of the security issues we face. One of the first steps we should take is assessing how much help from Azure we can use based on whether we're leveraging IaaS, PaaS, or SaaS.

Azure Security Center centralizes much of the help Azure has to offer. It provides a single dashboard, with a view into many of your services, and helps make sure you are following best practices. Continuously updated machine learning algorithms help identify whether the latest threats are aimed at your resources. And it helps your organization mitigate threats.

This module is only introductory. Security is a deep and complex topic, so whatever your cloud approach, an ongoing security education is necessary. However, this module should get you started in the right direction.  We explored:

+ Azure Security Center.
+ Azure Key Vault.
+ Azure Information Protection.
