Azure Virtual Network peering lets you connect virtual networks in the same or different regions. Azure Virtual Network peering provides secure communication between resources in the peered networks.

Suppose your engineering company is migrating services to Azure. The company is deploying services into separate Azure virtual networks. Private connectivity between the virtual networks isn't yet configured. Several business units identified services in the virtual networks that need to communicate with each other. 

You're responsible for implementing an Azure Virtual Network peering solution and enabling connectivity between the virtual networks. Two of your strategy goals include preventing exposure of the services to the internet, and keeping the integration as simple as possible. Your solution should address transit and connectivity concerns.

The goal of this module is to successfully implement Azure Virtual Network peering. 

## Learning objectives

In this module, you learn how to:

- Identify usage cases and product features of Azure Virtual Network peering.
