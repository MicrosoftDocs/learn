  title: ""
  questions:
  - content: "When virtual networks are successfully peered, what's the peering status for both virtual networks in the peering?"
    choices:
    - content: "**Initiated**"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The **Initiated** status is shown when the peering is first created."
    - content: "**Connected**"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The peering isn't successfully established until the peering status for both virtual networks is **Connected**."
    - content: "**Peered**"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. **Peered** isn't a valid virtual network peering status."
  - content: "What approach enables peered virtual networks to share the gateway and get access to resources?"
    choices:
    - content: "Point-to-site connectivity"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Point-to-site connectivity creates a secure connection to a virtual network from an individual client computer."
    - content: "Transitivity"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Transitivity refers to virtual networks communicating with the peers of their peers."
    - content: "Gateway transit"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Gateway transit allows peered virtual networks to share the gateway and get access to resources."
  - content: "How is Azure Virtual Network peering best described?"
    choices:
    - content: "Traffic between virtual networks is kept on the Microsoft backbone network."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The Azure backbone handles traffic between virtual networks in a virtual network peering."
    - content: "Virtual network peering disrupts other resources."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. When peering is implemented, there's no downtime to resources in either virtual network."
    - content: "Peered virtual networks must be in the same region."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Global virtual network peering connects virtual networks in different Azure regions."
