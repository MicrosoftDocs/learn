## Benefits and features

 -  **Single sign-on to any cloud or on-premises web app**. Azure Active Directory provides secure single sign-on to cloud and on-premises applications. SSO includes Microsoft 365 and thousands of SaaS applications such as Salesforce, Workday, DocuSign, ServiceNow, and Box.
 -  **Works with iOS, macOS, Android, and Windows devices**. Users can launch applications from a personalized web-based access panel, mobile app, Microsoft 365, or custom company portals using their existing work credentials. The experience is the same on iOS, macOS, Android, and Windows devices.
 -  **Protect on-premises web applications with secure remote access**. Access your on-premises web applications from everywhere and protect with multifactor authentication, conditional access policies, and group-based access management. Users can access SaaS and on-premises web apps from the same portal.
 -  **Easily extend Active Directory to the cloud**. You can connect Active Directory and other on-premises directories to Azure Active Directory in just a few steps. This connection means a consistent set of users, groups, passwords, and devices across both environments.
 -  **Protect sensitive data and applications**. You can enhance application access security with unique identity protection capabilities. This includes a consolidated view into suspicious sign-in activities and potential vulnerabilities. You can also take advantage of advanced security reports, notifications, remediation recommendations, and risk-based policies.
 -  **Reduce costs and enhance security with self-service capabilities**. Delegate important tasks such as resetting passwords and the creation and management of groups to your employees. Providing self-service application access and password management through verification steps can reduce helpdesk calls and enhance security.

> [!NOTE]
> If you are a Microsoft 365, Azure, or Dynamics CRM Online customer, you might not realize that you are already using Azure AD. Every Microsoft 365, Azure and Dynamics CRM tenant is already an Azure AD tenant. Whenever you want you can start using that tenant to manage access to thousands of other cloud applications Azure AD integrates with.
