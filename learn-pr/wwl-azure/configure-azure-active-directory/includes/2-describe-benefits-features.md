[Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)](/azure/active-directory/) is Microsoft's multi-tenant cloud-based directory and identity management service. Azure AD helps to support user access to resources and applications, such as:

- Internal resources and apps located on your corporate network.

- External resources like Microsoft 365, the Azure portal, and SaaS applications. 

- Cloud apps developed for your organization.

The following diagram shows an example implementation of Azure AD. In this scenario, Windows Server AD is using [Kerberos](/windows-server/security/kerberos/kerberos-authentication-overview) and [NTLM authentication](/windows-server/security/kerberos/ntlm-overview) to on-premises applications.

## Things to know about Azure AD features

Let's examine some of the prominent features of Azure AD. 

| Azure&nbsp;AD&nbsp;feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Single sign-on (SSO) access** | Azure AD provides secure single sign-on (SSO) to web apps on the cloud and to on-premises apps. Users can sign in with the same set of credentials to access all their apps. |
| **Ubiquitous device support** | Azure AD works with iOS, macOS, Android, and Windows devices, and offers a common experience across the devices. Users can launch apps from a personalized web-based access panel, mobile app, Microsoft 365, or custom company portals by using their existing work credentials. |
| **Secure remote access** | Azure AD enables secure remote access for on-premises web apps. Secure access can include multifactor authentication (MFA), conditional access policies, and group-based access management. Users can access on-premises web apps from everywhere, including from the same portal. |
| **Cloud extensibility** | Azure AD can extend to the cloud to help you manage a consistent set of users, groups, passwords, and devices across environments. |
| **Sensitive data protection** | Azure AD offers unique identity protection capabilities to secure your sensitive data and apps. Admins can monitor for suspicious sign-in activity and potential vulnerabilities in a consolidated view of users and resources in the directory. |
| **Self-service support** | Azure AD lets you delegate tasks to company employees that might otherwise be completed by admins with higher access privileges. Providing self-service app access and password management through verification steps can reduce helpdesk calls and enhance security. |

## Things to consider when using Azure AD features

Azure AD offers many features and benefits. Consider which features can be used to best support your corporate scenarios.

- **Consider enabling single sign-on access**. Enable SSO access for your users to connect to the cloud or use on-premises apps. Azure AD SSO supports Microsoft 365 and thousands of SaaS apps, such as Salesforce, Workday, DocuSign, ServiceNow, and Box.

- **Consider UX and device support**. Build a consistent user experience that works for all devices and directory access points. You can design custom company portals and personalized web-based access for your employees that lets them connect with their existing work credentials.

- **Consider benefits of secure remote access**. Protect your on-premises web apps by implementing secure remote access with MFA and access policies.

- **Consider advantages of cloud extensibility**. Connect Active Directory and other on-premises directories in the cloud to Azure AD in just a few steps. You can make it easier for your admins to manage the same users, groups, passwords, and devices across all supported environments.

- **Consider advanced protection for sensitive data**. Enhance the security of your sensitive data and apps by using the built-in protection features of Azure AD. Your admins can utilize advanced security reports, notifications, remediation recommendations, and risk-based policies.

- **Consider reduced costs, self-service options**. Take advantage of the Azure AD self-service features to help reduce costs for your organization. Delegate certain tasks like resetting passwords, or creating and managing groups to your non-admin users.
