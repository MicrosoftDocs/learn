  questions:
  - content: "Which choice correctly describes Azure Active Directory?"
    choices:
    - content: "Azure AD can be queried through LDAP."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Because Azure AD is based on the HTTP and HTTPS protocols, it can't be queried through LDAP. Instead, Azure AD uses the REST API over HTTP and HTTPS."
    - content: "Azure AD is primarily an identity solution."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Azure AD is primarily an identity solution. It's designed for internet-based applications by using HTTP and HTTPS communications."
    - content: "Azure AD uses organizational units (OUs) and group policy objects (GPOs)."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Azure AD users and groups are created in a flat structure. There are no organizational units (OUs) or group policy objects (GPOs)."
  
  - content: "What term defines a dedicated and trusted instance of Azure Active Directory?"
    choices:
    - content: "Azure tenant"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. A tenant is a dedicated and trusted instance of Azure AD. A tenant is automatically created when an organization signs up for a Microsoft cloud service subscription​."
    - content: "Identity"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. An identity is an object that can be authenticated. An identity can be a user with a username and password. Identities also include applications or other servers that might require authentication through secret keys or certificates."
    - content: "Azure AD account"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. An Azure AD Account is an identity created through Azure AD or another Microsoft cloud service, such as Microsoft 365. Identities are stored in Azure AD and accessible to the organization's cloud service subscriptions. This account is also sometimes called a work or school account."
  
  - content: "Review the design requirements for your identity solution. Which option should you implement to satisfy your system requirements?"
    choices:
    - content: "Azure Active Directory - Microsoft 365 Apps edition"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The Azure AD Microsoft 365 Apps edition doesn't provide the requested support for protecting sensitive data. Review the list of edition features, and consider the options for the Premium P2 edition."
    - content: "Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. AD DS is only one component of the Windows Active Directory suite. It's not an identity solution."
    - content: "Azure Active Directory - Premium P2 edition"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The Azure AD Premium P2 edition provides the support you need to meet your system requirements."
    - content: "Hybrid approach of AD DS and Azure Active Directory"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A hybrid approach isn't recommended. We recommend Azure AD, unless your configuration targets IaaS workloads that depend specifically on AD DS."

  - content: "Your users want to sign-in to devices, apps, and services from anywhere. Users want to sign-in by using an organizational work or school account instead of a personal account. What should you do first?"
    choices:
    - content: "Enable the device in Azure AD."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. You should first join the devices."
    - content: "Register the device with Azure AD."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Registering the device doesn't provide the features you need."
    - content: "Join the device to Azure AD."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Joining the device provides the features you need."
