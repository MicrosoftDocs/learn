  questions:
  - content: "A data scientist trains and logs a model with MLflow. When the data scientist deploys the model, the schema of the model's input and output isn't correct. What should the data scientist customize to fix the issue?"
    choices:
    - content: "Customize the model's environment."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The environment includes the necessary packages for the model to run."
    - content: "Change the model's flavor."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The flavor specifies the machine learning framework of the model."
    - content: "Customize the model's signature."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The model's signature defines the schemas of the inputs and outputs."
  - content: "A data scientist trained a deep learning model with TensorFlow. The deployed model is compute-intensive and needs to use the most optimal inference server for similar workloads. Which model type is compatible with compute-intensive and no-code deployments?"
    choices:
    - content: "MLflow"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. MLflow is ideal for standard deployments."
    - content: "Triton"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Triton is ideal for compute-intensive deployments."
    - content: "Custom"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. No-code deployment isn't available in Azure Machine Learning for custom models."
