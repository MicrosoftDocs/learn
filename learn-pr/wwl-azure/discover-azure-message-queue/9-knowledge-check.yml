  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "What is a key consideration when choosing to use Service Bus queues over Storage queues?"
    choices:
    - content: "Your solution requires the queue to provide a guaranteed first-in-first-out (FIFO) ordered delivery."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Service Bus queues provide a guaranteed first-in-first-out (FIFO) ordered delivery."
    - content: "Your application must store over 80 gigabytes of messages in a queue."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This is a feature of Storage queues, not Service Bus queues."
    - content: "You require server side logs of all of the transactions executed against your queues."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This is also a feature of Storage queues, not Service Bus queues."
  - content: "What is the main difference between Service Bus queues and topics with subscriptions?"
    choices:
    - content: "Queues allow processing of a message by a single consumer, while topics with subscriptions provide a one-to-many form of communication."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. A queue allows processing of a message by a single consumer. In contrast, topics and subscriptions provide a one-to-many form of communication."
    - content: "Queues allow processing of a message by multiple consumers, while topics with subscriptions provide a one-to-one form of communication."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Queues offer First In, First Out (FIFO) message delivery to one or more competing consumers, but only one consumer processes each message."
    - content: "Topics with subscriptions allow processing of a message by a single consumer, while queues provide a one-to-many form of communication."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Topics and subscriptions provide a one-to-many form of communication in a publish and subscribe pattern, scaling to large numbers of recipients."
  - content: "What is the role of the `ContentType` property in Service Bus message payloads?"
    choices:
    - content: "It encrypts the payload for secure transmission."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The `ContentType` property doesn't encrypt the payload."
    - content: "It determines the size of the payload."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The `ContentType` property doesn't determine the size of the payload."
    - content: "It enables applications to describe the payload, with the suggested format for the property values being a MIME content-type description."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The `ContentType` property describes the payload, suggesting a MIME content-type format."
  - content: "What is the purpose of the 'QueueClient' class in Azure Queue Storage when using .NET?"
    choices:
    - content: "It manages the configuration files for client applications."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The 'QueueClient' class is not used for managing configuration files, but for interacting with queues in Azure Queue Storage."
    - content: "It retrieves and manipulates queues stored in Azure Queue Storage."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The 'QueueClient' class is used to interact with queues in Azure Queue Storage, including creating, retrieving, and deleting queues."
    - content: "It creates and manage messages within a specific queue."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While 'QueueClient' does interact with messages, it is primarily used to retrieve and manipulate queues, not individual messages."
