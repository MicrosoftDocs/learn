  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "Which of the following advanced features of Azure Service Bus creates a first-in, first-out (FIFO) guarantee?"
    choices:
    - content: "Transactions"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A transaction groups two or more operations together into an execution scope."
    - content: "Scheduled delivery"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Messages can be submitted to a queue or topic for delayed processing, but that doesn't guarantee a FIFO."
    - content: "Message sessions"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. To create a first-in, first-out (FIFO) guarantee in Service Bus, use sessions. Message sessions enable joint and ordered handling of unbounded sequences of related messages."
  - content: "In Azure Service Bus messages are durably stored which enables a load-leveling benefit. Which of the following correctly describes the load-leveling benefit relative to a consuming application's performance?"
    choices:
    - content: "Performance needs to handle peak load"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Intermediating message producers and consumers with a queue means that the consuming application only has to be able to handle average load instead of peak load."
    - content: "Performance needs to handle average load"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Intermediating message producers and consumers with a queue means that the consuming application only has to be able to handle average load instead of peak load."
    - content: "Performance needs to handle low loads"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Intermediating message producers and consumers with a queue means that the consuming application only has to be able to handle average load instead of peak load."
