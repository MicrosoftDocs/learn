Azure Queue Storage is a service for storing large numbers of messages. You access messages from anywhere in the world via authenticated calls using HTTP or HTTPS. A queue message can be up to 64 KB in size. A queue might contain millions of messages, up to the total capacity limit of a storage account. Queues are commonly used to create a backlog of work to process asynchronously.

The Queue service contains the following components:

* **URL format:** Queues are addressable using the URL format `https://<storage account>.queue.core.windows.net/<queue>`. For example, the following URL addresses a queue in the diagram above `https://myaccount.queue.core.windows.net/images-to-download`

* **Storage account:** All access to Azure Storage is done through a storage account. 

* **Queue:** A queue contains a set of messages. All messages must be in a queue. The queue name must be all lowercase.

* **Message:** A message, in any format, of up to 64 KB. Before version 2017-07-29, the maximum time-to-live allowed is seven days. For version 2017-07-29 or later, the maximum time-to-live can be any positive number, or -1 indicating that the message doesn't expire. If this parameter is omitted, the default time-to-live is seven days.
