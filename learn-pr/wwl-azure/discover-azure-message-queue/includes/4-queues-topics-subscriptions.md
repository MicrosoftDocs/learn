The messaging entities that form the core of the messaging capabilities in Service Bus are **queues**, **topics and subscriptions**, and rules/actions.

## Queues

Queues offer **First In, First Out** (FIFO) message delivery to one or more competing consumers. That is, receivers typically receive and process messages in the order in which they were added to the queue. And, only one message consumer receives and processes each message. Because messages are stored durably in the queue, producers (senders) and consumers (receivers) don't have to process messages concurrently. 

A related benefit is **load-leveling**, which enables producers and consumers to send and receive messages at different rates. In many applications, the system load varies over time. However, the processing time required for each unit of work is typically constant. Intermediating message producers and consumers with a queue means that the consuming application only has to be able to handle average load instead of peak load.

Using queues to intermediate between message producers and consumers provides an inherent loose coupling between the components. Because producers and consumers aren't aware of each other, a consumer can be upgraded without having any effect on the producer.

You can create queues using the Azure portal, PowerShell, CLI, or Resource Manager templates. Then, send and receive messages using clients written in C#, Java, Python, and JavaScript.

## Receive modes

You can specify two different modes in which Service Bus receives messages: **Receive and delete** or **Peek lock**.

### Receive and delete

In this mode, when Service Bus receives the request from the consumer, it marks the message as consumed and returns it to the consumer application. This mode is the simplest model. It works best for scenarios in which the application can tolerate not processing a message if a failure occurs. For example, consider a scenario in which the consumer issues the receive request and then crashes before processing it. As Service Bus marks the message as consumed, the application begins consuming messages upon restart. It misses the message that it consumed before the crash.

### Peek lock

In this mode, the receive operation becomes two-stage, which makes it possible to support applications that can't tolerate missing messages.

1.  Finds the next message to be consumed, **locks** it to prevent other consumers from receiving it, and then, return the message to the application.

2.  After the application finishes processing the message, it requests the Service Bus service to complete the second stage of the receive process. Then, the service **marks the message as consumed**.

If the application is unable to process the message for some reason, it can request the Service Bus service to **abandon** the message. Service Bus **unlocks** the message and makes it available to be received again, either by the same consumer or by another competing consumer. Secondly, there's a **timeout** associated with the lock. If the application fails to process the message before the lock timeout expires, Service Bus unlocks the message and makes it available to be received again.

## Topics and subscriptions

A queue allows processing of a message by a single consumer. In contrast to queues, topics and subscriptions provide a one-to-many form of communication in a publish and subscribe pattern. It's useful for scaling to large numbers of recipients. Each published message is made available to each subscription registered with the topic. Publisher sends a message to a topic and one or more subscribers receive a copy of the message, depending on filter rules set on these subscriptions. The subscriptions can use more filters to restrict the messages that they want to receive.

Publishers send messages to a topic in the same way that they send messages to a queue. But, consumers don't receive messages directly from the topic. Instead, consumers receive messages from subscriptions of the topic. A topic subscription resembles a virtual queue that receives copies of the messages that are sent to the topic. Consumers receive messages from a subscription identically to the way they receive messages from a queue.

Creating a topic is similar to creating a queue, as described in the previous section. You can create topics and subscriptions using the Azure portal, PowerShell, CLI, or Resource Manager templates. Then, send messages to a topic and receive messages from subscriptions using clients written in C#, Java, Python, and JavaScript.

### Rules and actions

In many scenarios, messages that have specific characteristics must be processed in different ways. To enable this processing, you can configure subscriptions to find messages that have desired properties and then perform certain modifications to those properties. While Service Bus subscriptions see all messages sent to the topic, you can only copy a subset of those messages to the virtual subscription queue. This filtering is accomplished using subscription filters. Such modifications are called **filter actions**. When a subscription is created, you can supply a filter expression that operates on the properties of the message. The properties can be both the system properties (for example, **Label**) and custom application properties (for example, **StoreName**.) The SQL filter expression is optional in this case. Without a SQL filter expression, any filter action defined on a subscription is performed on all the messages for that subscription.
