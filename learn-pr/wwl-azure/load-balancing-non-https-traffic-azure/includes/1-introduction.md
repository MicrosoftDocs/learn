Imagine yourself in the role of a network engineer at an organization that is in the process of migrating infrastructure and applications to Azure. As the network engineer you need to ensure that line-of-business applications, services, and data are available to end users of your corporate network whenever and wherever possible and ensure that users get access to those network resources in an efficient and timely manner. 

Azure provides several different flavors of load balancing services that you can use to help with the distribution of workloads across multiple computing resources on your networks. The aim of load balancing is to optimize the use of your resources, while maximizing throughput and minimizing the time it takes for a response. You can create internal and public load balancers in an Azure environment to distribute the network traffic within your network and the network traffic arriving from outside your network. In this module you will learn about using the Azure Load Balancer, and Traffic Manager load balancing services.

## Learning objectives

- ​    Understand options for load balancing
