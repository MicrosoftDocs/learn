- **Report user activity within the tenant**. The security team requires access to the history of every event in the tenant.

- **Measure user experience and analyze user behavior**. The reputation of the company depends on the performance, reliability, and security of its systems. It's critical to monitor your systems closely to identify any performance problems or attacks before they can affect users.
