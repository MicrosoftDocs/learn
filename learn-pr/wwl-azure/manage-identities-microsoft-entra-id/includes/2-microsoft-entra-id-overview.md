Microsoft Entra ID is a cloud-based identity and access management service that your employees can use to access external resources. Example resources include Microsoft 365, the Azure portal, and thousands of other SaaS applications.

Microsoft Entra ID also helps them access internal resources like apps on your corporate intranet, and any cloud apps developed for your own organization. To learn how to create a tenant, see [Quickstart: Create a new tenant in Microsoft Entra ID](/entra/fundamentals/create-new-tenant).

To learn the differences between Active Directory and Microsoft Entra ID, see [Compare Active Directory to Microsoft Entra ID](/entra/fundamentals/compare). You can also refer to [Microsoft Cloud for Enterprise Architects Series](/microsoft-365/solutions/cloud-architecture-models) posters to better understand the core identity services in Azure like Microsoft Entra ID and Microsoft 365.

## Who uses Microsoft Entra ID?

Microsoft Entra ID provides different benefits to members of your organization based on their role:

 -  IT admins use Microsoft Entra ID to control access to apps and app resources, based on business requirements.

This role has the equivalent access of a user who is assigned the Owner role at the subscription scope. For more information, see [Azure roles, Microsoft Entra roles, and classic subscription administrator roles](/azure/role-based-access-control/rbac-and-directory-admin-roles).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Owner                                | This role helps you manage all Azure resources, including access. This role is built on a newer authorization system called Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC) that provides fine-grained access management to Azure resources. For more information, see [Azure roles, Microsoft Entra roles, and classic subscription administrator roles](/azure/role-based-access-control/rbac-and-directory-admin-roles).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

| Azure subscription                   | Used to pay for Azure cloud services. You can have many subscriptions and they're linked to a credit card.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Tenant                               | A dedicated and trusted instance of Microsoft Entra ID. The tenant is automatically created when your organization signs up for a Microsoft cloud service subscription. These subscriptions include Microsoft Azure, Microsoft Intune, or Microsoft 365. This tenant represents a single organization and is intended for managing your employees, business apps, and other internal resources. For this reason, it's considered a workforce tenant configuration. By contrast, you can create a tenant in an *external* configuration, which is used in customer identity and access management (CIAM) solutions for your consumer-facing apps (learn more about [Microsoft Entra External ID](/entra/external-id/customers/overview-customers-ciam)). |
| Single tenant                        | Azure tenants that access other services in a dedicated environment are considered single tenant.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Multitenant                          | Azure tenants that access other services in a shared environment, across multiple organizations, are considered multitenant.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Microsoft Entra directory            | Each Azure tenant has a dedicated and trusted Microsoft Entra directory. The Microsoft Entra directory includes the tenant's users, groups, and apps and is used to perform identity and access management functions for tenant resources.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Custom domain                        | Every new Microsoft Entra directory comes with an initial domain name, for example domainname.onmicrosoft.com. In addition to that initial name, you can also add your organization's domain names. Your organization's domain names include the names you use to do business and your users use to access your organization's resources, to the list. Adding custom domain names helps you to create user names that are familiar to your users, such as alain@contoso.com.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Microsoft account (also called, MSA) | Personal accounts that provide access to your consumer-oriented Microsoft products and cloud services. These products and services include Outlook, OneDrive, Xbox LIVE, or Microsoft 365. Your Microsoft account is created and stored in the Microsoft consumer identity account system that's run by Microsoft.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
