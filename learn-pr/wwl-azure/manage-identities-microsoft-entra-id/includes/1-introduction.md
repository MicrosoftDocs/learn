This module focuses on effectively managing identities and enhancing security in Microsoft Entra ID, ensuring that users, groups, and external identities were protected against security threats and unauthorized access.

## Scenario

Imagine you're an identity and security administrator responsible for safeguarding user accounts and access to resources in your organization's Microsoft Entra ID environment. Your organization relies on Microsoft Entra ID for authentication and access control, and you need to ensure that identities are secured, whether they were internal or external, and that they're protected against potential security breaches.

## Learning objectives

By the end of this module, participants will be able to:

 -  Secure user identities in Microsoft Entra ID to prevent unauthorized access and protect user accounts.
 -  Implement security measures to protect groups in Microsoft Entra ID, ensuring proper access control and group management.
 -  Make informed recommendations on when to use external identities and how to securely manage them.
 -  Implement security measures to protect external identities, maintaining confidentiality and integrity.
 -  Implement Microsoft Entra ID Protection to proactively identify and respond to identity-related security threats and vulnerabilities.

## Goals

The module aims to equip participants with the knowledge and skills necessary to manage identities and enhance security within Microsoft Entra ID. Participants will learn how to secure user accounts, groups, and external identities, and they'll be able to implement Microsoft Entra ID Protection to detect and mitigate identity-related security risks, ultimately strengthening the organization's overall security posture.
