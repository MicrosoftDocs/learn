  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "When someone creates a device enrollment, they must specify how they want to assign devices to IoT hubs. What is the default setting?"
    choices:
    - content: "Evenly weighted distribution"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. This value is the default setting and will maintain a balanced workload as devices are provisioned and retired. If you are provisioning devices to only one IoT hub, you can keep this setting."
    - content: "Static configuration via the enrollment list"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This value is not the default option. Use this option when the specification of the desired IoT hub in the enrollment list takes priority over the Device Provisioning Service-level allocation policy."
    - content: "Lowest latency"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This value is not the default option. Use this option when you multiple IoT hubs and want devices to be provisioned to the IoT hub based on the hub with the lowest latency to the device."
  - content: "The device enrollment process includes the option to specify the initial configuration of a device. What mechanism is used to specify initial device settings?"
    choices:
    - content: "The enrollment process instructs IoT hub to trigger a direct method when the initial device connected event is detected."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The device enrollment process is separate from a device’s registration with IoT hub and does not include the ability to invoke a direct method on a device."
    - content: "The enrollment process includes an initial device twin state field that enables you to specify desired properties for the device."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The Initial Device Twin State field contains JSON data that represents the initial configuration of desired properties for the device. When the device connects to IoT hub for the first time, it will read the desired properties and update itself."
    - content: "The enrollment process uses a security token to request device access permission from IoT hub and pushes the initial configuration to the device directly."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The device enrollment process does not interface directly with devices."
