When your code has an exception, how you "handle" it is of critical importance to keep your code from crashing unexpectedly. In this module you learned how to handle these sorts of exceptions, surrounding code that might raise an exception with a Try...Catch block.

In this module, you learned how to:

- Create an exception class.
- Use a Try/Catch block.
- Throw an exception.
- Implement exception handling in your code.

Congratulations on making it this far!
