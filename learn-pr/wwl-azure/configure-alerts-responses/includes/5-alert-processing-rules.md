have the rule processed on a predefined schedule. Alert processing rules are different from alert rules. Alert rules generate new alerts, while alert processing rules modify the fired alerts as they're being fired.

You can use alert processing rules to add action groups or remove (suppress) action groups from your fired alerts. You can apply alert processing rules to different resource scopes, from a single resource, or to an entire subscription. You can also use them to apply various filters or have the rule work on a predefined schedule.

Common uses for alert processing rules include:

- Suppress notifications during planned maintenance
- Management at scale
- Add action groups to all alert types

You can control when an alert processing rule will apply. The alert processing rule is always active, by default. You can select a one-time window for this rule to apply, or you can have a recurring window, such as a weekly recurrence.

## Suppressing notifications during planned maintenance

Many customers set up a planned maintenance time for their resources, either on a one-time basis or on a regular schedule. The planned maintenance might cover a single resource, like a virtual machine, or multiple resources, like all virtual machines in a resource group. So, you might want to stop receiving alert notifications for those resources during the maintenance window. Alert processing rules allow you to do that.

You could suppress alert notifications by disabling the alert rules themselves at the beginning of the maintenance window, and reenable them after the maintenance is over. In that case, the alerts won't fire in the first place. That approach has several limitations:

- This approach is only practical if the scope of the alert rule is exactly the scope of the resources under maintenance. For example, a single alert rule might cover multiple resources, but only a few of those resources are going through maintenance. So, if you disable the alert rule, you won't be alerted when the remaining resources covered by that rule run into issues.
- You might have many alert rules that cover the resource. Updating all of them is time consuming and error prone.
- You might have some alerts that aren't created by an alert rule at all, like alerts from Azure Backup.

In all these cases, an alert processing rule provides an easy way to suppress notifications.

## Management at scale

Most customers tend to define a few action groups that are used repeatedly in their alert rules. For example, they might want to call a specific action group whenever any high-severity alert is fired. As their number of alert rules grows, manually making sure that each alert rule has the right set of action groups is becoming harder.

Alert processing rules allow you to specify that logic in a single rule, instead of having to set it consistently in all your alert rules. They also cover alert types that aren't generated by an alert rule.

## Add action groups to all alert types

Azure Monitor alert rules let you select which action groups will be triggered when their alerts are fired. However, not all Azure alert sources let you specify action groups. Some examples of such alerts include Azure Backup alerts, VM Insights guest health alerts, Azure Stack Edge, and Azure Stack Hub. For those alert types, you can use alert processing rules to add action groups.

## Alert processing rules filters and scope

Each alert processing rule has a scope. A scope is a list of one or more specific Azure resources, a specific resource group, or an entire subscription. The alert processing rule applies to alerts that fired on resources within that scope.

You can also define filters to narrow down which specific subset of alerts are affected within the scope.

You can figure the following filters:

- **Alert context (payload)**. The rule applies only to alerts that contain any of the filter's strings within the alert context section of the alert. This section includes fields specific to each alert type.
- **Alert rule ID**. The rule applies only to alerts from a specific alert rule. The value should be the full resource ID. To locate the alert rule ID, open a specific alert rule in the portal, select Properties, and copy the Resource ID value. 
- **Alert rule name**. The rule applies only to alerts with this alert rule name. It can also be useful with a Contains operator.
- **Description**. The rule applies only to alerts that contain the specified string within the alert rule description field.
- **Monitor condition**. The rule applies only to alerts with the specified monitor condition, either Fired or Resolved.
- **Monitor service**. The rule applies only to alerts from any of the specified monitoring services that are sending the signal. Different services are available depending on the type of signal.
- **Resource**. The rule applies only to alerts from the specified Azure resource. For example, you can use this filter with Does not equal to exclude one or more resources when the rule's scope is a subscription.
- **Resource group**. The rule applies only to alerts from the specified resource groups. For example, you can use this filter with Does not equal to exclude one or more resource groups when the rule's scope is a subscription.
- **Resource type**. The rule applies only to alerts on resources from the specified resource types, such as virtual machines. You can use Equals to match one or more specific resources. You can also use Contains to match a resource type and all its child resources.
- **Severity**. The rule applies only to alerts with the selected severities.

If you define multiple filters in a rule, all the rules apply. There's a logical AND between all filters.

## Alert processing rules actions

Alert processing rules can perform one of the following actions:

- **Suppression**: This action removes all the action groups from the affected fired alerts. So, the fired alerts won't invoke any of their action groups, not even at the end of the maintenance window. Those fired alerts will still be visible when you list your alerts in the portal, Azure Resource Graph, API, or PowerShell. The suppression action has a higher priority over the Apply action groups action. If a single fired alert is affected by different alert processing rules of both types, the action groups of that alert will be suppressed.
- **Apply action groups**: This action adds one or more action groups to the affected fired alerts.

## Create an alert processing rule

To create an alert processing rule, perform the following steps:
1. In the **Alerts** page of the Azure Portal select **Create > Alert processing rules** to open the new alert processing rule wizard.
1. On the **Scope** tab, you select which fired alerts are covered by this rule. Pick the scope of resources whose alerts will be covered. You can choose multiple resources and resource groups, or an entire subscription. You can also optionally add filters.
1. On the **Rule settings** tab, you select which action to apply on the affected alerts. Choose between **Suppress notifications** or **Apply action group**. If you choose **Apply action group**, you can select existing action groups by selecting **Add action groups**. You can also create a new action group.
1. On the **Scheduling** tab, you select an optional schedule for the rule. By default, the rule works all the time, unless you disable it. You can set it to work On a specific time, or you can set up a Recurring schedule.
1. On the **Details** tab, you give this rule a name, pick where it will be stored, and optionally add a description for your reference.
1. On the **Tags** tab, you can optionally add tags to the rule.
1. On the **Review + create** tab, you can review and create the alert processing rule.
