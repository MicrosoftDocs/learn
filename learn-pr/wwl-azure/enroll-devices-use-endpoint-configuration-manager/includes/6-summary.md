This module covered the Microsoft Configuration Manager and Microsoft Intune. The Configuration Manager client gives administrators the ability to track software on a device, provide inventory information in relation to hardware, and manage and deploy the OS and LoB applications. For users, the Configuration Manager client enables a feature rich self-service catalog of software that empowers the user to choose what software to install. Client deployment methods such as client push, manual deployment, OS deployment, and Microsoft Intune allow admins flexibility in their deployment approach. Built-in features within Configuration Manager such as client status, client activity, primary user, OS build, and Client check can alert you to issues requiring further attention. Collections are a way for Configuration Manager to represent devices or users that have same degree of commonality allowing for easier targeted deployments and reporting.
