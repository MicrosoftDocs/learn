  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "Which type of scaling involves adding or removing resources (such as virtual machines or containers) to meet demand?"
    choices:
    - content: "Vertical scaling"
      isCorrect: false

    - content: "Horizontal scaling"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Horizontal scaling is adding or subtracting the number of resources."
    - content: "Direct scaling"
      isCorrect: false
