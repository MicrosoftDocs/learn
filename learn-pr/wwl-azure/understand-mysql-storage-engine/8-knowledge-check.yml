      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Azure Database for MySQL doesn't support the Blackhole storage engine."
    - content: "MyISAM and InnoDB"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Azure Database for MySQL doesn't support the MyISAM storage engine."
    - content: "Memory and InnoDB"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Azure Database for MySQL supports InnoDB and Memory storage engines."
  - content: "If you don't specify a storage engine when creating a table, what happens?"
    choices:
    - content: "The table will not be created."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. the table will still be created if you don't specify a storage engine."
    - content: "The data will never be written to disk."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. data will still be written to disk if you don't specify a storage engine."
    - content: "The default storage engine will be used."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. InnoDB is the default storage engine and will be used if you don't specify a storage engine."
  - content: "Which statement should you use when specifying the storage engine for a table?"
    choices:
    - content: "CREATE TABLE"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. CREATE TABLE with the ENGINE = InnoDB is the correct statement for specifying the storage engine for a table."
    - content: "CREATE ENGINE"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. you don't use the CREATE ENGINE statement to specify the storage engine for a table."
    - content: "CREATE TABLESPACE"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. you don't use the CREATE TABLESPACE statement to specify the storage engine for a table."
  - content: "What is best practice when creating tables in InnoDB?"

    - content: "All tables are created in the system tablespace."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. It isn't best practice for tables to be created in the system tablespace."
    - content: "All tables are created in the file per table tablespace."

      explanation: "Correct. Best practice is for tables to be created in their own file-per-table tablespace."
    - content: "All tables are created in a custom general tablespace."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. It isn't best practice for tables to be created in a custom general tablespace."
  - content: "What is the purpose of the write-ahead log (WAL)?"
    choices:
    - content: "To improve performance."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Although write-ahead logging can improve performance, that isn't its primary purpose."
    - content: "To recover data in the event of a crash."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The primary purpose of the write-ahead log is to recover data in the event of a crash."
    - content: "To group changes together and write them to disk in one batch."
