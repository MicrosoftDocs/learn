In this module, you learned how to set up and configure Microsoft Defender for Cloud to protect your cloud resources and improve your security posture. You explored the differences between Foundational CSPM and Defender CSPM. Then you reviewed the various workload protections plans available, and learned how to apply security policies based on the Microsoft Cloud Security Benchmark.

## Key concepts covered

- **Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM)**: Understanding Foundational CSPM capabilities versus Defender CSPM features including governance, regulatory compliance, and attack path analysis.
- **Workload Protection Plans**: Deploying Microsoft Defender plans for Servers, Storage, Databases, Containers, APIs, and other Azure services to protect your workloads.
- **Microsoft Cloud Security Benchmark (MCSB)**: Applying Microsoft's cloud security framework with control domains covering network security, identity management, data protection, and more.
- **Security Policies and Compliance**: Configuring policies, managing recommendations, and improving regulatory compliance using built-in standards.
- **Secure Score**: Understanding how secure score is calculated and how to improve your security posture by remediating recommendations within security controls.
- **Just-in-Time (JIT) VM Access**: Implementing JIT access to reduce attack surface by controlling inbound traffic to management ports (requires Microsoft Defender for Servers Plan 2).
- **Azure Arc Integration**: Extending Defender for Cloud protection to on-premises and multicloud resources through Azure Arc.
- **Threat Detection**: Understanding MITRE ATT&CK framework integration and brute force attack detection capabilities.

## Looking ahead: Microsoft Defender Portal

Microsoft Defender for Cloud is progressively integrating with the Microsoft Defender portal, which provides a unified security operations experience across Microsoft Defender products. As this integration evolves, you see more capabilities including:

- **Defender Portal Integration**: Unified security experience across Microsoft Defender for Cloud, Defender for Endpoint, Defender for Office 365, and other Microsoft Defender services.
- **Risk-Based Cloud Secure Score**: An enhanced secure score model in the Defender portal that factors in asset risk and criticality for more accurate security prioritization.
- **Unified Security Recommendations**: A consolidated view of security recommendations across your entire Microsoft security ecosystem.
- **Cloud Security Dashboard**: Enhanced dashboards providing comprehensive visibility into cloud security posture, threats, and compliance.
- **Enhanced Cloud Asset Inventory**: Improved asset management capabilities for tracking and securing resources across multicloud and hybrid environments.

These features represent the continuing evolution of Microsoft Defender for Cloud as it becomes an integral part of Microsoft's unified security platform.
