Microsoft Defender for Cloud helps streamline the process for meeting regulatory compliance requirements, using the regulatory compliance dashboard. Defender for Cloud continuously assesses your hybrid cloud environment to analyze the risk factors according to the controls and best practices in the standards that you've applied to your subscriptions. The dashboard reflects the status of your compliance with these standards.

When you enable Defender for Cloud on an Azure subscription, the Microsoft cloud security benchmark is automatically assigned to that subscription. This widely respected benchmark builds on the controls from the Center for Internet Security (CIS), PCI-DSS and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) with a focus on cloud-centric security.<br>

The regulatory compliance dashboard shows the status of all the assessments within your environment for your chosen standards and regulations. As you act on the recommendations and reduce risk factors in your environment, your compliance posture improves.<br>

## Assess your regulatory compliance<br>

The regulatory compliance dashboard shows your selected compliance standards with all their requirements, where supported requirements are mapped to applicable security assessments. The status of these assessments reflects your compliance with the standard.

Use the regulatory compliance dashboard to help focus your attention on the gaps in compliance with your chosen standards and regulations. This focused view also enables you to continuously monitor your compliance over time within dynamic cloud and hybrid environments.

The dashboard provides you with an overview of your compliance status and the set of supported compliance regulations. You'll see your overall compliance score, and the number of passing vs. failing assessments associated with each standard.

Recommendations give you suggestions on how to better secure your resources. You implement a recommendation by following the remediation steps provided in the recommendation.

> [!NOTE]
> Assessments **run approximately every 12 hours,** so you will see the impact on your compliance data only after the next run of the relevant assessment.

## Remediation steps

After reviewing all the recommendations, decide which one to remediate first. We recommend that you prioritize the security controls with the highest potential to increase your secure score.

1. From the list, select a recommendation.

2. Follow the instructions in the Remediation steps section. Each recommendation has its own set of instructions. The following screenshot shows remediation steps for configuring applications to only allow traffic over HTTPS.
