title: Develop Monitor and Status Dashboards
summary: This comprehensive module teaches you to develop effective monitoring and status dashboards for modern DevOps environments. You'll learn to use Azure Dashboards for integrated visualizations, Azure Monitor Workbooks for interactive reporting, and Power BI for advanced analytics. Learn to configure GitHub monitoring, track critical pipeline health metrics (failure rates, duration, flaky tests), and optimize pipeline performance for cost, time, and reliability. Discover strategies for building custom monitoring applications and implementing concurrency optimization to maximize throughput while controlling costs.

  By the end of this module, you'll be able to:

  -   Configure comprehensive monitoring in GitHub with status badges, insights, and Actions analytics

  -   Create and customize Azure Dashboards with pinned visualizations from multiple Azure services

  -   Develop interactive Azure Monitor Workbooks with parameters, queries, and custom visualizations

  -   Implement Power BI dashboards for advanced DevOps analytics and business intelligence

  -   Build custom monitoring applications using Azure DevOps REST APIs and Application Insights SDKs

  -   Monitor pipeline health metrics including failure rates, execution duration, and flaky test detection

  -   Optimize pipelines for cost, time, performance, and reliability using data-driven strategies

  -   Implement pipeline concurrency optimization to balance throughput performance with infrastructure costs

  -   Design effective visualization strategies that communicate system health to diverse stakeholders

  -   Establish alerting and notification systems based on dashboard metrics and threshold violations
prerequisites: |
  - Fundamental understanding of Azure DevOps or GitHub workflows and CI/CD concepts
  - Basic familiarity with Azure portal navigation and Azure Monitor fundamentals
  - Experience with build and release pipelines in either Azure Pipelines or GitHub Actions
