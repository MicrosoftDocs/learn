  title: Optimize Pipelines for Cost, Time, Performance, and Reliability
  description: "Learn data-driven strategies to optimize CI/CD pipelines across multiple dimensions: reduce costs through efficient resource usage, minimize execution time with parallelization, improve performance with caching and incremental builds, and enhance reliability through retry logic and stability patterns. Discover balancing trade-offs between competing optimization goals."
