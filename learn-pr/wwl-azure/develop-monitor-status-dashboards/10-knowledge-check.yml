quiz:
  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
    - content: "What is one of the advantages of using Azure dashboards for data visualization?"
      choices:
        - content: "Enables deep integration into Azure, allowing visualizations to be pinned from multiple Azure pages."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct. Azure dashboards offer deep integration into Azure, supporting both metrics and logs, and allowing data from multiple sources."
        - content: "Allows custom parameters support for log charts"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. Azure dashboards do not provide custom parameters support for log charts."
        - content: "Supports interactivity with dashboard data"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. Azure dashboards do not support interactivity with dashboard data."
    - content: "What is the impact of flaky tests on the overall health and reliability of Azure Pipelines?"
      choices:
        - content: "Flaky tests can cause intermittent build failures, leading to unpredictable pipeline behavior, consuming resources for investigations, and delaying the progression of the pipeline."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct. Flaky tests can lead to unpredictable pipeline behavior, consume resources for investigations, and delay the progression of the pipeline, affecting the overall health and reliability of Azure Pipelines."
        - content: "Flaky tests have no significant impact on the overall health and reliability of Azure Pipelines."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. Flaky tests can cause intermittent build failures, leading to unpredictable pipeline behavior and affecting the overall health and reliability of Azure Pipelines."
        - content: "Flaky tests only affect the testing phase of the pipeline and do not impact the overall health and reliability of Azure Pipelines."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. While flaky tests originate from the testing phase, their impact extends to the overall health and reliability of the pipeline itself."
    - content: "What is a key consideration when optimizing pipeline concurrency in Azure DevOps?"
      choices:
        - content: "Balancing performance requirements against cost considerations."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct. Optimization involves balancing performance needs with cost considerations for efficient resource utilization."
        - content: "Increasing the number of parallel jobs without considering cost implications."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. While increasing parallel jobs can improve performance, it's important to balance this with cost considerations."
        - content: "Ignoring pipeline performance metrics."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. Monitoring pipeline performance metrics is crucial for identifying optimization opportunities."
