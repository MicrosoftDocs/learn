Azure virtual machine (VM) extensions are small applications that provide post-deployment configuration and automation tasks on Azure VMs. For example, if a virtual machine requires software installation, anti-virus protection, or to run a script inside of it, a VM extension can be used.

 -  Identify features and usage cases for virtual machine extensions.
 -  Identify features and usage cases for custom script extensions.
