Azure Administrators need to secure access to their Azure resources like virtual machines (VMs), websites, networks, and storage. They need mechanisms to help them manage who can access their resources, and what actions are allowed. Organizations that do business in the cloud recognize that securing their resources is a critical function of their infrastructure.

In this module, your business is investigating how to ensure their corporate data and assets are protected.
