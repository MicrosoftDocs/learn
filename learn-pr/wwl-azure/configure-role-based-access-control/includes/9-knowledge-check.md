Your company has decided to implement Azure role-based access control (RBAC) to secure their resources and manage user access. You're reviewing the scenarios to support, and have a list of issues to address:

- Not all users have access to the same resources. A new employee should have only limited resource access. 

- Most administrators require full access to all corporate resources. A few admins need limited access to specific resources so they can read the settings, but not make changes.

- How are scopes and permissions applied for Azure resources, including the custom role definition?

- Your manager has asked if there are differences between Azure roles and Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) roles.
