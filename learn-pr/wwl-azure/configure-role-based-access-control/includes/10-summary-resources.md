Azure role-based access control (RBAC) is a system that enables granular access management of Azure resources. Azure Administrators use Azure RBAC to segregate duties within a team, and grant users the specific access they need to perform their jobs.

In this module, you identified the features and use cases for RBAC. You discovered how to create role definitions and role assignments, and find and use built-in Azure RBAC roles. You explored how to use RBAC to manage access to subscriptions with RBAC. You reviewed the differences between Azure RBAC and Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) roles.
