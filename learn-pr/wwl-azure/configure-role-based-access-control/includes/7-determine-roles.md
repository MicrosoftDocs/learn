Azure provides over 100 pre-defined role definitions. Roles can grant access to data within an object. If a user has _read data_ access to a storage account, then they can read the blobs or messages in the storage account.

The following table describes four built-in role definitions that are considered fundamental.

| Fundamental&nbsp;role | Description |
| --- | --- |
| _Owner_ | The _Owner_ role has full access to all resources, including the right to delegate access to others. The _Service Administrator_ and _Co-Administrators_ roles are assigned the _Owner_ role at the subscription scope. |
| _Contributor_ | The _Contributor_ role can create and manage all types of Azure resources. This role can't grant access to others. | 
| _Reader_ | The _Reader_ role can view existing Azure resources. | 
| _User Access Administrator_ | The _User Access Administrator_ role can manage user access to Azure resources. |
