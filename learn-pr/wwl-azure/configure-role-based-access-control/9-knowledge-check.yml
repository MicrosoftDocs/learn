  title: ""
  questions:
  - content: "You have three virtual machines (VM1, VM2, VM3) in a resource group. A new admin is hired, and they need to be able to modify settings on VM3. They shouldn't be able to make changes to VM1 or VM2. How can you implement RBAC to minimize administrative overhead?"
    choices:
    - content: "Assign the admin to the Contributor role on the resource group."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The Contributor role assignment on the resource group allows the admin to modify all VMs in the resource group."
    - content: "Assign the admin to the Contributor role on VM3."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. When you assign the Contributor role to the specific resource, the admin can change the settings on that resource; in this case, VM3."
    - content: "Move VM3 to a new resource group, and then assign the admin to the Owner role on VM3."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The Owner role gives the admin more permissions than they need. It's best to give only the permissions required."
  - content: "What is the purpose of the 'AssignableScopes' permissions in a role definition?"
    choices:
    - content: "Specifies the actions that aren't allowed"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The 'AssignableScopes' permissions don't specify the actions that aren't allowed."
    - content: "Specifies the scopes where a role definition can be assigned"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The 'AssignableScopes' permissions specify the scopes where a role definition can be assigned."
    - content: "Specifies the actions that are allowed"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The 'AssignableScopes' permissions don't specify the actions that are allowed."
  - content: "Explain the main differences between Azure roles and Microsoft Entra roles."
    choices:
    - content: "Azure roles apply to Azure resources. Microsoft Entra roles apply to Microsoft Entra resources such as users, groups, and domains."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct.  Azure roles are used to manage access to VMs, storage, and other Azure resources. Microsoft Entra roles are used to manage access to Microsoft Entra resources like user accounts and passwords."
    - content: "Azure roles can be assigned at the root level."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Azure roles can only be assigned at the management groups, subscriptions, resource groups, or resources scope."
    - content: "Microsoft Entra roles are used to manage access to Azure resources."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Azure roles are used to view and manage Azure resources. Azure roles are used to manage access to VMs, storage, and other Azure resources. Microsoft Entra roles are used to manage access to Microsoft Entra resources like user accounts and passwords."
