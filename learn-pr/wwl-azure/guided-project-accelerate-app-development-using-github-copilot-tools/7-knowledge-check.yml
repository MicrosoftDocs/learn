    choices:
    - content: "To manage the library's patron accounts, books, and book loans."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. GitHub Copilot helps with code development, not with managing library resources."
    - content: "To replace the damaged servers."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. GitHub Copilot doesn't replace servers, it aids in code development."
    - content: "To assist in the efficient development of the application."
      isCorrect: true

  - content: "What is the primary function of the `ConsoleApp` class in the Library Console application?"
    choices:
    - content: "It is responsible for loading and managing data from JSON files."
      isCorrect: false
