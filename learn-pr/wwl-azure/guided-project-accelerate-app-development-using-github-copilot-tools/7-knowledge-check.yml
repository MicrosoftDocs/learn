    choices:
    - content: "To manage the library's patron accounts, books, and book loans."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. GitHub Copilot helps with code development, not with managing library resources."
    - content: "To replace the damaged servers."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. GitHub Copilot doesn't replace servers, it aids in code development."
    - content: "To assist in the efficient development of the application."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. GitHub Copilot is used to aid in the efficient development of the application."
  - content: "What is the primary function of the `ConsoleApp` class in the Library Console application?"
    choices:
    - content: "It is responsible for loading and managing data from JSON files."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The `ConsoleApp` class doesn't directly handle data loading. Data loading is managed by the `JsonData` class."
    - content: "It is responsible for setting up the dependency injection container and running the console application."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The setup of the dependency injection container and running of the console application is handled by the `Program.cs` file."
    - content: "It manages the console-based user interface of the application, interacting with various services and repositories to perform operations related to patrons and loans."

      explanation: "Correct. The 'SearchBooks' method is used to check if a book is available for loan or if it is currently on loan to another patron."
  - content: "What is the purpose of using GitHub Copilot in the context of unit testing?"
    choices:
    - content: "GitHub Copilot is used to run the unit tests."

      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Refactoring is done to reduce overhead, not increase it."
    - content: "To change the external behavior of the code."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Refactoring doesn't change the external behavior of the code, it improves the internal structure."
