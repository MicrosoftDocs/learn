To prepare for the exam, students can access free Fundamentals practice tests and certification exam vouchers by visiting: 

The [Microsoft Student Certification](https://aka.ms/studentcertification) page 

The [Microsoft Virtual Training Days](https://aka.ms/mvtds) page 

Certiport is the Microsoft exam delivery provider for Fundamentals exams. PearsonVUE is the Microsoft exam delivery provider for both Fundamentals and ARB exams.  

With a Microsoft Academic Volume License, you can decide: 

- Which students can sit the exam  

- Manage exam scheduling and proctoring of the exam sessions 

- Obtain detailed reports on all proctored exam sessions  

If you choose to purchase a volume license for certifications for your students, you can purchase directly online from PearsonVUE or Certiport. 

After students attain a Microsoft Fundamentals Certification exam voucher, they must schedule a certification exam: 

- Through a nearby Certiport Testing center that administers the Fundamentals certification exams. (If your institution is provisioning Certiport exam vouchers, your institution can administer Fundamentals certification exams for students by becoming a Certiport Testing Center.
