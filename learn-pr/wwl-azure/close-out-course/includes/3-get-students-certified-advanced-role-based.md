Exam vouchers are required to take an ARB certification exam. Institutions have two ways of purchasing ARB student vouchers: 

1. Institutions can purchase academic volume licenses through Microsoft  

1. Institutions can visit the PearsonVUE site to purchase vouchers directly

After attaining a Microsoft ARB Certification exam voucher, students must schedule a certification exam: 

 - Through a [PearsonVUE Testing Center](https://aka.ms/PVUETC).  

 - Institutions can administer ARB exams by becoming a PearsonVUE Testing Center. If you’d like your institution to become a PearsonVUE Testing Center, visit [Become a PearsonVUE test center](https://aka.ms/BecomePVUETC) to learn more. 

 - Students can also take an Advanced Role Based (ARB) exam via online remote proctoring.  

With PearsonVUE, individual students schedule exams through Microsoft without the help of a faculty member. A self-serve walkthrough is provided throughout the whole journey. Exams taken with PearsonVUE aren't associated with an institution and any post-exam data doesn't go to the institution.
