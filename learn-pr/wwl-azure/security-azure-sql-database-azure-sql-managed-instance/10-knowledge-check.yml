  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "Why is database auditing enabled in Azure SQL Database?"
    choices:
    - content: "To track database activities and detect security violations."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Auditing enables tracking of database access and activities, helping to identify unauthorized actions and ensure compliance with security policies."
    - content: "To reduce data storage requirements."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Auditing does not directly impact storage requirements."
    - content: "To automatically optimize database indexes."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Auditing is crucial for tracking operations and ensuring security compliance, not for index optimization."
  - content: "When is Azure SQL Database Always Encrypted recommended?"
    choices:
    - content: "For encrypting data only at rest."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Always Encrypted is designed to protect data not just at rest, but also in use and in transit."
    - content: "For scenarios requiring encryption of sensitive data in use, at rest, and in transit."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Always Encrypted provides a comprehensive encryption solution, protecting sensitive data throughout its lifecycle."
    - content: "When database performance is the only consideration."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "While performance is a consideration, Always Encrypted is primarily recommended for scenarios requiring strong data encryption."
  - content: "What is the benefit of implementing Transparent Database Encryption (TDE) in Azure SQL Database?"
    choices:
    - content: "To encrypt data in transit between client and server."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "TDE is focused on data at rest, whereas data in transit encryption is handled by other mechanisms."
    - content: "To automatically redact sensitive data in query results."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "TDE does not provide data redaction in query results; this is achieved through other features like dynamic data masking."
    - content: "To encrypt data at rest, protecting stored data from unauthorized access."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "TDE encrypts stored data, ensuring it remains inaccessible to unauthorized users without the appropriate encryption keys."
  - content: "What is a use case for the Microsoft Purview governance portal?"
    choices:
    - content: "To increase network bandwidth."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The Purview governance portal is used for data governance, not for managing network bandwidth."
    - content: "To classify and manage sensitive information across data sources."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "The Microsoft Purview governance portal provides tools for discovering, classifying, and managing sensitive data across an organization's data estate."
    - content: "To directly manage virtual machine resources."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Purview is focused on data governance across various data sources, not on direct VM management."
  - content: "What is the purpose of Microsoft Entra database authentication in Azure SQL Database?"
    choices:
    - content: "To increase database storage efficiency."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Database authentication focuses on security, not on enhancing storage efficiency."
    - content: "To enhance query performance."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Authentication mechanisms are designed to secure access, rather than directly improving query performance."
    - content: "To secure database access by integrating with Microsoft Entra ID."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Microsoft Entra database authentication enhances security by allowing for Microsoft Entra ID-based authentication, providing a more secure and manageable access control mechanism."
