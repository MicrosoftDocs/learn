### Data Map

Microsoft Purview automates data discovery by providing data scanning and classification for assets across your data estate. Metadata and descriptions of discovered data assets are integrated into a holistic map of your data estate. Microsoft Purview Data Map provides the foundation for data discovery and data governance. Microsoft Purview Data Map is a cloud native PaaS service that captures metadata about enterprise data present in analytics and operation systems on-premises and cloud. Microsoft Purview Data Map is automatically kept up to date with built-in automated scanning and classification system. Business users can configure and use the data map through an intuitive UI and developers can programmatically interact with the Data Map using open-source Apache Atlas 2.2 APIs. Microsoft Purview Data Map powers the Microsoft Purview Data Catalog, the Microsoft Purview Data Estate Insights and the Microsoft Purview Data Policy as unified experiences within the Microsoft Purview governance portal.

### Data Catalog app

With the Microsoft Purview Data Catalog, business and technical users can quickly and easily find relevant data using a search experience with filters based on lenses such as glossary terms, classifications, sensitivity labels and more. For subject matter experts, data stewards and officers, the Microsoft Purview Data Catalog provides data curation features such as business glossary management and the ability to automate tagging of data assets with glossary terms. Data consumers and producers can also visually trace the lineage of data assets: for example, starting from operational systems on-premises, through movement, transformation & enrichment with various data storage and processing systems in the cloud, to consumption in an analytics system like Power BI.

### Data Estate Insights app

With the Microsoft Purview Data Estate Insights, the chief data officers and other governance stakeholders can get a birdâ€™s eye view of their data estate and can gain actionable insights into the governance gaps that can be resolved from the experience itself.

### Data Sharing app

Microsoft Purview Data Sharing enables organizations to securely share data both within your organization or cross organizations with business partners and customers. You can share or receive data with just a few clicks. Data providers can centrally manage and monitor data sharing relationships, and revoke sharing at any time. Data consumers can access received data with their own analytics tools and turn data into insights.

### Data Policy app

Microsoft Purview Data Policy is a set of central, cloud-based experiences that help you manage access to data sources and datasets securely and at scale.

 -  Manage access to data sources from a single-pane of glass, cloud-based experience.
 -  Enables at-scale access provisioning.
 -  Introduces a new data-plane permission model that is external to data sources.
 -  It is seamlessly integrated with Microsoft Purview Data Map and Catalog:
     -  Search for data assets and grant access only to what is required via fine-grained policies.
     -  Path to support SaaS, on-premises, and multicloud data sources.
     -  Path to create policies that leverage any metadata associated to the data objects.
 -  Based on role definitions that are simple and abstracted (for example: **Read**, **Modify**).
