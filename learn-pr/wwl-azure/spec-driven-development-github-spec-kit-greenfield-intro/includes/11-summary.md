In this module, you learned how to implement a spec-driven development (SDD) methodology using GitHub Spec Kit. You used the SDD workflow to develop a greenfield application by defining specifications upfront rather than iteratively prompting the AI with fragmentary instructions.

The main takeaway from this module is the ability to implement a spec-driven development process, which allows you to use AI tools like GitHub Copilot to generate code based on structured specifications. This approach enables you to focus on defining clear requirements and technical plans before implementation begins, ensuring that generated code aligns with intended behaviors from the start. You also learned how to compare SDD with other methodologies, set up your environment for GitHub Spec Kit, and use commands like `/speckit.constitution`, `/speckit.specify`, `/speckit.plan`, and `/speckit.tasks` to generate the artifacts that guide implementation. These skills are essential for effectively using AI-driven tools in a structured, enterprise-ready workflow.

You can apply the knowledge gained in this module to build greenfield applications with confidence, maintain consistency across AI-assisted development sessions, and reduce the gap between specifications and implementation. By practicing spec-driven development with GitHub Spec Kit, you can enhance your productivity and deliver higher-quality software that meets stakeholder requirements.
