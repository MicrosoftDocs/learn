Spec-driven development (SDD) is a structured approach to software development that treats specifications as executable sources of truth rather than throwaway planning documents. When you use SDD with AI coding assistants like GitHub Copilot, the specification guides code generation directly, ensuring the implementation matches your intended behavior from the start.

Imagine you're a software developer working for a consulting firm that uses AI-assisted development tools. You need to build a new greenfield application for a client. Rather than iteratively prompting the AI with fragmentary instructions and discovering requirements as you go, you want a more structured approach. With spec-driven development and GitHub Spec Kit, you can transform project documentation into specification files, technical plans, and implementation tasks that GitHub Copilot uses to generate aligned, production-ready code.

The topics covered in this module include:

- Understanding what spec-driven development is and why it matters now.
- Exploring the principles and phases of the SDD workflow.
- Comparing spec-driven development to other methodologies like Waterfall, Agile, and test-driven development.
- Examining the SDD workflow phases in detail: Specify, Plan, Tasks, and Implement.
- Introducing GitHub Spec Kit as a toolkit for practicing SDD.
- Configuring your environment and installing GitHub Spec Kit.
- Using GitHub Spec Kit commands to generate the constitution, spec, plan, and tasks files.

After completing this module, you'll be able to:

- Describe the principles and phases of the spec-driven development methodology.
- Use GitHub Spec Kit commands to create the constitution.md, spec.md, plan.md, and tasks.md files.
- Implement a greenfield application from start to finish using GitHub Spec Kit's AI-assisted workflows.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To complete this GitHub Copilot training, you must have an active subscription for GitHub Copilot in your personal GitHub account (includes the GitHub Copilot Free plan), or you must be assigned to a subscription managed by an organization or enterprise. Module activities might include GitHub Copilot suggestions that match public code. If you're a member of an organization on GitHub Enterprise Cloud who is assigned to a GitHub Copilot subscription through your organization, the setting for suggestions matching public code might be inherited from your organization or enterprise. If your account blocks suggestions that match public code, module activities might not work as expected.
