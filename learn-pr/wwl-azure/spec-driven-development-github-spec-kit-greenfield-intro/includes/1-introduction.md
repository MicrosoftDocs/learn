Spec-driven development (SDD) is a structured approach to software development that treats specifications as executable sources of truth rather than throwaway planning documents. When you use SDD with AI coding assistants like GitHub Copilot, the specification guides code generation directly, ensuring the implementation matches your intended behavior from the start.

Imagine you're a developer who's interested in using AI-assisted development tools on a greenfield project. Rather than iteratively prompting the AI with fragmentary instructions and discovering requirements as you go, you use spec-driven development to define clear specifications upfront. GitHub Spec Kit helps you transform project documentation into specification files, technical plans, and implementation tasks that GitHub Copilot uses to generate aligned, production-ready code.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To complete this GitHub Copilot training, you must have an active subscription for GitHub Copilot in your personal GitHub account (includes the GitHub Copilot Free plan), or you must be assigned to a subscription managed by an organization or enterprise. Module activities might include GitHub Copilot suggestions that match public code. If you're a member of an organization on GitHub Enterprise Cloud who is assigned to a GitHub Copilot subscription through your organization, the setting for suggestions matching public code might be inherited from your organization or enterprise. If your account blocks suggestions that match public code, module activities might not work as expected.
