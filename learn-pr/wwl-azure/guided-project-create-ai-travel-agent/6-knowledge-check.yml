  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "Which of the following is true about the Semantic Kernel SDK?"
    choices:
    - content: "Developers should avoid using Semantic Kernel SDK as it adds unnecessary complexity."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The Semantic Kernel SDK is designed to simplify the integration of AI."
    - content: "Semantic Kernel SDK uses abstraction to reduce the learning curve of integration AI."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Semantic Kernel SDK eases AI integration by providing abstraction and orchestration."
    - content: "Semantic Kernel SDK is only suitable for advanced AI developers."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The Semantic Kernel SDK is suitable for developers of all levels."
  - content: "What is the main purpose of plugins in the Semantic Kernel SDK?"
    choices:
    - content: "To process large language models and generate responses."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Plugins are not responsible for generating responses, but for executing custom functions."
    - content: "To encapsulate functions that can be used by the AI."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Plugins allow you to organize and expose functions to be invoked by the kernel."
    - content: "To improve the accuracy of prompts in the AI model."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Plugins are used to execute code and interact with external systems, not to improve prompt accuracy."
  - content: "Which option assigns a role in a prompt to the large language model (LLM)?"
    choices:
    - content: "Using the `role` attribute in the `message` tag."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. You can assign a role to the LLM by using the `role` attribute in the `message` tag."
    - content: "Using the `ChatHistory` object on the LLM response."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The `ChatHistory` object is used to store the conversation history."
    - content: "Using the `assignRole` attribute in the `chat` tag."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. You can assign a role to the LLM by using the `role` attribute in the `message` tag."
