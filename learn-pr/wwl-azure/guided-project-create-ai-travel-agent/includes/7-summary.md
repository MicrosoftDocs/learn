In this module, you developed a proof-of-concept AI travel agent using the Semantic Kernel SDK. You practiced creating plugins that define the tasks the kernel should complete. You practiced using predefined plugins provided by the Semantic Kernel package. You also practiced using the auto function calling behavior of the Semantic Kernel SDK to route the user's intent to the appropriate plugins. Great work!
