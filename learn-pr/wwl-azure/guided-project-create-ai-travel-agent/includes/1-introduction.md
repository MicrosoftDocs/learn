Suppose you're a developer for Margie's Travel, a global leader in the travel and hospitality industry. The company offers a wide range of services, including flight bookings, hotel reservations, guided tours, and vacation packages. Margie's Travel has a strong global presence, with offices and partners in major cities worldwide. With a commitment to delivering exceptional travel experiences, Margie's Travel is continuously exploring innovative technologies to enhance customer interactions and streamline travel planning. Now they're exploring the integration of cutting-edge artificial intelligence (AI) technology to enhance their services.

To provide travelers with personalized and immersive travel experiences,  Margie's Travel decided to integrate a chatbot application into its digital platform. This chatbot, named "TravelBot", is intended to serve as a virtual travel assistant, helping customers plan their trips, discover new destinations, and create detailed itineraries. 

You're tasked with creating a proof of concept for TravelBot, demonstrating its ability to understand natural language queries, provide intelligent responses, and assist travelers in planning their trips. To power TravelBot's intelligence and conversational capabilities, you choose to use the Semantic Kernel SDK.

This module guides you through the steps required to develop a proof of concept AI Travel assistant chatbot using the Semantic Kernel SDK. By the end of this module, you complete a small chatbot application that can understand user queries, generate intelligent responses, and provide personalized travel recommendations.
