  questions:
  - content: "You're working in Visual Studio Code. You cloned a GitHub repository to Visual Studio Code and you're editing code in a Jupyter notebook. To test the code, you want to run a cell within the notebook. Which compute should you use?"
    choices:
    - content: "Compute instance"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. You can use a compute instance to run a notebook in Visual Studio Code."
    - content: "Compute cluster"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. You can't use a compute cluster to run a notebook in Visual Studio Code."
    - content: "Azure Databricks cluster"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. You can't use a Databricks cluster to run a notebook in Visual Studio Code."
  - content: "You're experimenting with component-based pipelines in the Designer. You want to quickly iterate and experiment, as you're trying out varying configurations of a pipeline. You're using a compute cluster. To minimize the start-up time each time you submit a pipeline, which parameter should you change?"
    choices:
    - content: "Compute size"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. You shouldn't change the compute size when you want the compute cluster to remain available in between pipeline job runs."
    - content: "Idle time before scale down"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. By increasing the idle time before scale down, you can run multiple pipelines consecutively without the compute cluster resizing to zero nodes in between jobs."
    - content: "Maximum number of instances"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. You shouldn't change the maximum number of instances when you want the compute cluster to remain available in between pipeline job runs."
