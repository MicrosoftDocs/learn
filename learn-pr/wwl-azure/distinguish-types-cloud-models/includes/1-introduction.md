When you move to the cloud, you have multiple options on how you deploy your solutions.

## Introduction to cloud deployment models

There are three different cloud deployment models: Public Cloud, Private Cloud, and Hybrid Cloud. A cloud deployment model defines where your data is stored and how your customers interact with it – how do they get to it, and where do the applications run? It also depends on how much of your own infrastructure you want or need to manage.

After completing this module, you will be able to:

- Understand public, private, and hybrid cloud models.
- Decide which cloud deployment model is best for you.
