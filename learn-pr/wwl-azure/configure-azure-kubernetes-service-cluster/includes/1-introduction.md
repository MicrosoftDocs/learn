Azure Policy is an add-on that enables centralized, consistent enforcement of policies and safeguards on Kubernetes clusters at scale.

## Scenario

Imagine you have a large Kubernetes cluster with hundreds or thousands of pods and deployments. You need to ensure that all resources are compliant with your organization's policies and regulations. Azure Policy makes it possible to manage and report on the compliance state of your Azure Kubernetes Service clusters from one place. For example, you can use Azure Policy to enforce policies such as disallowing root privileges or requiring specific labels on pods. Azure Policy ensures that your cluster is secure and compliant with your organization's standards. With Azure Policy, you can also create custom policies that meet your specific needs. For instance, you can create a policy that requires all pods to use a specific container image or that limits the number of replicas for a deployment. By using Azure Policy, you can ensure that your Kubernetes cluster is secure, compliant, and consistent across your organization.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this module, you'll be able to:

 -  Enable and configure Azure Policy for Azure Kubernetes Service.
 -  Assign policy definitions to an Azure Kubernetes Service cluster.
 -  Use namespaces to logically isolate workloads and resources.
 -  Enable host-based encryption for Azure Kubernetes Service agent nodes.

## Goals

The goal of this module is to teach you how to use Azure Policy to enforce policies and safeguards on your Kubernetes clusters at scale. Azure Policy Ensures that your cluster is secure, compliant, and consistent across your organization.
