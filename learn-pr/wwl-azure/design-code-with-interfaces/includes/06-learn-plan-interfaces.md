Interfaces are a powerful tool for achieving flexible and modular code design. They're useful when you need a common set of functionality across multiple classes, or when you need to extend functionality without altering the existing structure of a class. By programming with interfaces, developers can isolate functionality, decouple components, and make their code more adaptable to changes. Interfaces also promote code reusability since different classes can implement the same interface.

Planning for interfaces and abstract classes before writing code can help developers create robust, bug-free code more efficiently. Here are some steps a developer can follow to plan for interfaces and abstract classes before diving into the coding process:

1. As you plan your project and create class diagrams, look for areas where classes have dependencies on other classes.  Consider whether those dependencies could be replaced with a service that an interface can provide.

1. Define any necessary interfaces. Once you identify the areas where a service is useful, define the behaviors the service should provide.

1. Reexamine the relationships between any interfaces and classes you created. Consider whether some classes or interfaces could benefit from inheritance. 

1. Determine the contracts and parameters your interfaces need. If you find that a default implementation would be more useful, consider using an abstract class instead.

1. Dive into the implementation details, being careful not to introduce interdependencies between  classes and services.

Planning your project before diving into the coding process can help you create maintainable, bug-free code more efficiently.
