Interfaces allow developers to create modular and flexible code. Since implementation details are abstract, many parts of a project can be updated or replaced independently, without affecting the rest of the code. Using interfaces can help prevent tightly coupled code.

Tightly coupled code occurs when there are strong dependencies between different parts of a program. When you modify a tightly coupled class, you need to update any code that uses that class. As a result, it can be challenging to make changes to one module without affecting others, and that comes with a higher risk of introducing accidental bugs.

Take a moment to examine the code below:

```c#
public class WeatherService
{
    public string GetWeatherData()
    {
        // Code to fetch weather data from a specific weather API
        return "Sunny";
    }
}

public class WeatherReporter
{
    public void ReportWeather()
    {
        WeatherService weatherService = new WeatherService();
        Console.WriteLine("Today's weather is: " + weatherService.GetWeatherData());
    }
}
```

In this example, the `WeatherReporter` directly depends on the `WeatherService` to fetch weather data as a displayable string. This dependence means `WeatherReporter` class is tightly coupled with the `WeatherService` class. Suppose the `GetWeatherData` method is updated to return a different data type so that weekly and hourly data can be included in the result. 

    ```c#
    public class WeatherService
    {
        public WeatherData GetWeatherData()
        {
            // Code to fetch weather data from a specific weather API
            return weatherDataObject);
        }
    }
    ```

Any changes to the `WeatherService` implementation would require changes to the `WeatherReporter` class. This is what is meant by tightly coupled code.

To reduce the tight coupling, you can introduce an interface, such as `IWeatherService`, which the `WeatherService` class implements. The interface could define a method such as `string GetCurrentWeather`, allowing developers to enforce the kind of data that should be used. 

    ```c#
    public interface IWeatherService
    {
        public string GetCurrentWeather();
    }
    ```

    ```c#
     public class WeatherService: IWeatherService
    {
        public WeatherData GetWeatherData()
        {
            // Code to fetch weather data from a specific weather API
            return weatherDataObject;
        }

        // Implemented method
        public string GetCurrentWeather()
        {
            // Code to fetch weather data from a specific weather API
            return "Sunny";
        }
    }
    ```

By relying on an interface, the `WeatherReporter` becomes decoupled from any specific `WeatherService` implementations, and it only needs to trust the contract established in the `IWeatherService` interface. 

Using interfaces to create modular designs allows developers to write code around objects and services without needing to work around any specific implementation details. Correctly using interfaces is a great way to create loosely coupled code that is flexible and maintainable.
