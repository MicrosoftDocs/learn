Welcome to this interactive skills validation experience. Completing this module helps prepare you for the *Deploy and manage Azure Arc-enabled Servers*assessment.<br>

In this guided exercise, you practice onboarding, securing, monitoring, and updating on-premises Windows servers by using Azure Arc. The guided exercise combines both learning and hands-on practice. The skills validated include:

 -  Onboarding on-premises Windows servers to Azure Arc
 -  Managing on-premises Windows servers by using Azure Arc and Azure Policy
 -  Protecting on-premises Windows servers by using Microsoft Defender for Cloud
 -  Monitoring on-premises Windows servers by using Azure Monitor
 -  Updating on-premises Windows servers by using Azure Update Manager
 -  Configuring on-premises Windows servers by using Azure VM extensions and azcmagent CLI

By the end of this guided exercise, you gain hands-on experience in creating and configuring these services in Azure.

> [!NOTE]
> In the guided exercise, you complete an end-to-end project by following step-by-step instructions.
