Using Azure Migrate, you can assess and migrate on-premises Windows Server instances to Microsoft Azure.

## Scenario

Contoso is a medium-size financial services company in London with a branch office in New York. Most of its compute environment runs on-premises on Windows Server. This includes virtualized workloads on Windows Server 2012 R2 hosts. Contoso's IT staff are in the process of migrating Contoso servers to Windows Server 2025.

Contosoâ€™s IT director realizes that Contoso has an outdated operational model with limited automation and reliance on dated technology. The Contoso IT Engineering team has started exploring Microsoft Azure capabilities. They want to determine whether Azure services might assist with modernizing the current operational model through automation and virtualization.

As part of the initial design, the Contoso IT team asked you, their lead system engineer and server administrator, to set up a proof of concept environment. This environment must verify whether Azure services can help to modernize the IT infrastructure and meet business goals.

As the lead system engineer, you've been tasked with planning and testing the process of migrating server workloads to Azure.

This module covers planning a migration, using Azure Migrate, migrating server workloads using Windows Server Migration Tools, assessing physical servers with Azure Migrate, and migrating on-premises servers to Azure.

By the end of this module, you're able to plan a migration and select appropriate server migration tools. You'll also learn how to use Azure Migrate, how to assess physical servers, and how to migrate those servers.

## Learning objectives

After completing this module, you'll be able to:

- Plan your migration.
- Describe Azure Migrate.
- Migrate server workloads using Windows Server Migration Tools.
- Assess physical servers with Azure Migrate.
- Migrate on-premises servers to Azure.
