Your course has helped to build your students technical skills and knowledge and the materials you have been using from Microsoft are aligned to industry recognized certifications. These certifications can augment your students’ degree path and validate the skills they've gained, skills that are needed to be successful across various in-demand technical careers. 

Demand for technical certifications is growing. For students who are looking to stand out in the job market, and for you their faculty member looking to support them, technical certifications can be a differentiator. For a student, adding a Microsoft Certification to their profile alongside artifacts from class demonstrates not only their learning from coursework, but also a commitment to keeping up with the evolving forefront of technology.  

Let’s work on wrapping up the term and supporting your students so that they can be successful on their certification exams.

Checklist for closing out the term: 

1. Review the certification plan with your students – ensure expectations are clear 

   - If your plan is to have your students apply the free Fundamentals certification exam vouchers from Microsoft, then ensure that they've all visited the [Student Certification page](https://aka.ms/studentcertification) to review the details 

   - Ensure that you're explicit with your students about the date in which they'll take their exam and any expectations around knowing the results of their exam 

2. Help improve MSLE 

   - Take a moment to complete a post-course survey so we can better understand your experience as a faculty member within the Microsoft Learn for Educators program. You can find this survey by navigating the Courses tab on the [MSLE portal](https://aka.ms/MSLEPort)  

3. Determine what you’ll teach next 

   - Once you have completed teaching your course, take a quick breather and celebrate this milestone!  

   - We hope your course was a success and that you consider continuing to use Microsoft curriculum and teaching materials in your classes.  

   - Check out [MSLE](https://aka.ms/MSLE) to find new materials we've added to the program. Once you determine what you're going to be teaching next, add those course details to the [MSLE portal](https://aka.ms/MSLEPort) so that we can support you and your students.
