Contoso historically relied on tape backups for restores and disaster recovery. As part of the move to Azure, they needed to consider alternative backup and recovery procedures.

In this module, you learned about Azure Backup, Recovery Services vaults, and Azure Backup policies. You also learned how to implement Windows IaaS VM recovery, perform a backup and restore of on-premises workloads, and how to manage Azure VM backups.

Now, you can lead the Contoso IT Team in modernizing their business continuity plan with Azure Backup.
