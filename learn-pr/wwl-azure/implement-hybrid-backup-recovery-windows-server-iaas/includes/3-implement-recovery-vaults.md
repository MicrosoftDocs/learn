Contoso could use Recovery Services vaults to keep backup data for their various Azure services, such as IaaS VMs (Linux or Windows) and Azure SQL databases. Recovery Services vault is a storage entity in Azure that houses data, which typically is copies of data, or configuration information for VMs, workloads, servers, or workstations.

## What is Recovery Services vault?

Recovery Services vaults make it easier to organize your backup data, while minimizing management overhead. A *Recovery Services vault* is a storage entity that stores the recovery points created over time. It also contains the backup policies that are associated with protected items. Recovery Services vaults support DPM, Windows Server, Azure Backup Server, and more.

> [!TIP]
> Within an Azure subscription, you can create up to 25 Recovery Services vaults per region.

Creating and managing Recovery Services vaults in the Azure portal is straightforward because the Backup service is integrated into the Azure **Settings** menu. This integration means you can create or manage a Recovery Services vault in the context of the target service.

For example, to review the recovery points for a VM, select the VM, and then within the **Operations** heading, select **Backup**. The backup information specific to that VM displays. You don't need to remember the name of the Recovery Services vault that stores the recovery points, you can access this information from the VM.

If multiple servers are protected using the same Recovery Services vault, it might be more logical to use the Recovery Services vault itself. You can search for all Recovery Services vaults in the subscription, and then select one from the list.
