Azure Backup enables you to back up and recover Windows Server infrastructure as a service (IaaS) virtual machines (VMs), which includes full VM and file-level recovery.

## Scenario

Contoso is a medium-size financial services company in London with a branch office in New York. Most of its compute environment runs on-premises on Windows Server. This includes virtualized workloads on Windows Server 2012 R2 hosts. Contoso IT staff are in the process of migrating Contoso servers to Windows Server 2019.

Contoso’s IT director realizes that Contoso has an outdated operational model with limited automation and reliance on dated technology. The Contoso IT Engineering team has started exploring Microsoft Azure capabilities. They want to determine whether Azure services might assist with modernizing the current operational model through automation and virtualization.

As part of the initial design, the Contoso IT team asked you, their lead system engineer and server administrator, to set up a proof of concept environment. This environment must verify whether Azure services can help to modernize the IT infrastructure and meet business goals.

The company still relies on tape backups for restores and disaster recovery. As part of the move to Azure, they need to consider alternative backup and recovery procedures.

In this module, you'll learn about Azure Backup before learning to implement Recovery Vaults and Azure Backup Policies. You'll then learn how to implement Windows IaaS VM recovery, perform backup and restore of on-premises workloads, and manage Azure VM backups.

By the end of this module, you'll be ready to help the Contoso IT team use Azure Backup to back up and recover Windows Server IaaS VMs.

## Learning objectives
