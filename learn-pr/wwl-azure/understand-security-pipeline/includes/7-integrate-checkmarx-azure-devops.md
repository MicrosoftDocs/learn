## Checkmarx functionality

Checkmarx functionality includes:

 -  Best fix location. Checkmarx highlights the best place to fix your code to minimize the time required to remediate the issue. A visual chart of the data flow graph indicates the ideal location in the code to address multiple vulnerabilities using a single line of code.
 -  Quick and accurate scanning. Checkmarx helps reduce false positives, adapt the ruleset to minimize false positives, and understand the root cause for results.
 -  Incremental scanning. Using Checkmarx, you can test just the code parts that have changed since the last code check-in. It helps reduce scanning time by more than 80 percent. It also enables you to incorporate the security gate within your continuous integration pipeline.
 -  Seamless integration. Checkmarx works with integrated development environments (IDEs), build management servers, bug tracking tools, and source repositories.
 -  Code portfolio protection. Checkmarx helps protect your entire code portfolio, both open source, and in-house source code. It analyzes open-source libraries, ensuring licenses are adhered to and removing any open-source components that expose the application to known vulnerabilities. Also, Checkmarx Open Source helps provide complete code portfolio coverage under a single-unified solution with no extra installations or administration required.
 -  Easy to start Open Source Analysis. With Checkmarx's Open Source Analysis, you do not need extra installations or multiple management interfaces; you turn it on. Within minutes, a detailed report is generated with precise results and detailed mitigation instructions. Because analysis results are designed with the developer in mind, no time is wasted trying to understand the required action items to mitigate detected security or compliance risks.
