The configurable content filters are sufficient for most content moderation needs. However, you might need to create custom block lists in the Microsoft Foundry portal as part of your content filtering configurations to filter terms specific to your use case. 


### Scenario
Your company plans to create custom block lists in Microsoft Foundry projects to prevent the use of industry-specific terms such as internal project code names, confidential client identifiers, and sensitive regulatory references that should never appear in generated or processed content. This ensures that project and hub-based environments enforce compliance by blocking restricted terminology while allowing safe and relevant outputs. By combining these custom block lists with the existing configurable filters, the organization achieves precise moderation tailored to both general and business-specific requirements.
