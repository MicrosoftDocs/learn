In this module, you learned about Azure Monitor alerts. You can use alerts to identify and address issues before they affect your users. You learned how to configure Azure alert rules based on telemetry signals. You learned to configure actions groups to receive alert notifications.  

The main takeaways from this module are:

- Azure Monitor captures telemetry data. Alerts can use this data to identity and then notify you of potential issues. 

- There are different types of alerts to support various configuration and monitoring scenarios. Alert types include metric alerts, log alerts, activity log alerts, and smart detection alerts.

- You manage alerts by monitoring the alert state. States include new, acknowledged, and closed.

- You configure alert rules based on target resource, signal, criteria, and severity. 

- Action groups define notification preferences and actions for when an alert is triggered. These actions include email, SMS, push, voice calls, and automated actions.
