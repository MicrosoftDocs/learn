  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "Which of the following statements about Microsoft Entra ID is true?"
    choices:
    - content: "Microsoft Entra ID implements the same authentication protocols as on-premises AD DS."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Microsoft Entra ID does not use on-premises AD DS Kerberos authentication; instead, it uses HTTP and HTTPS protocols such as SAML, WS-Federation, and OpenID Connect for authentication, and OAuth for authorization."
    - content: "Microsoft Entra ID is essentially on-premises AD DS in the cloud."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Although Microsoft Entra ID has many similarities to AD DS, there are also many differences. It's important to realize that using Microsoft Entra ID is different from deploying an AD DS domain controller on an Azure VM and then adding it to your on-premises domain."
    - content: "Microsoft Entra users and groups are created in a flat structure."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Microsoft Entra users and groups are created in a flat structure, and there are no OUs or GPOs."

    choices:
    - content: "Maria found an account called `MSOL_c778af008d92`."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The account with the MSOL prefix resides in on-premises AD DS, but it's created during setup of Microsoft Entra Connect."
    - content: "Marie found an account called `Sync_CONTOSO-DC1_c778af008d92@Contoso.com`."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. An account with the prefix Sync is created in Microsoft Entra ID as part of the Microsoft Entra Connect setup."
    - content: "Maria found an account called `AAD_c778af008d92`."
      isCorrect: false
