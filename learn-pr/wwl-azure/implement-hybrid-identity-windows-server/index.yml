title: Implement hybrid identity with Windows Server
summary: In this module, you’ll learn to configure an Azure environment so that Windows IaaS workloads requiring Active Directory are supported. You’ll also learn to integrate on-premises Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) environment into Azure.
abstract: |
  After completing this module, you will be able to:
  - Select an Azure AD integration model.
  - Plan for Azure AD integration.
  - Prepare on-premises AD DS for directory synchronization.
  - Install and configure directory synchronization using Azure AD Connect.
  - Implement Seamless Single Sign-on (SSO).
  - Enable Azure AD login for an Azure Windows virtual machine (VM).
  - Describe Azure AD DS.
  - Implement and configure Azure AD DS.
  - Manage Windows Server 2019 in an Azure AD DS instance.
  - Join a Windows Server VM to a managed domain.
