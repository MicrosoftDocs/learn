DevOps influences the entire application lifecycle starting with the planning phase.

Imagine that you work for a software development company in the retail industry. Your company is planning to migrate an online store from an old app to a new app to stay competitive in the market. The development and operations teams are working in silos, with little collaboration and communication, and lack of accountability, which has made planning your project more difficult. To address these issues, your organization decides to adopt a DevOps approach to build mutual respect among teams, set clearly defined roles and responsibilities, become agile, and implement practices that improve collaboration and communication.
