When you use Microsoft Azure, you can reliably run your mission-critical SAP workloads and scenarios on a scalable, compliant, and enterprise-proven platform. You get the scalability, flexibility, and cost savings of Azure. With the expanded partnership between Microsoft and SAP, you can run SAP applications across development and test and production scenarios in Azure and be fully supported. From SAP NetWeaver to SAP S/4HANA, SAP BI on Linux to Windows, and SAP HANA to SQL.

## SAP NetWeaver

For organizations that need compute and storage resources for their SAP NetWeaver applications, in minimal time and without lengthy procurement cycles, the solution is **Azure virtual machines**. You can use Azure virtual machines to deploy classical applications, like SAP NetWeaver-based applications, in Azure.

## SAP HANA Azure virtual machines

For running SAP HANA, SAP has more and stronger conditions for infrastructure than for running NetWeaver or other SAP applications and DBMS. As a result, a smaller number of Azure VMs qualify for running the SAP HANA DBMS. The list of supported Azure infrastructure supported for SAP HANA can be found in the [SAP HANA hardware directory](https://www.sap.com/dmc/exp/2014-09-02-hana-hardware/enEN/#/solutions?filters=iaas;ve:24&amp;id=s:2634).
