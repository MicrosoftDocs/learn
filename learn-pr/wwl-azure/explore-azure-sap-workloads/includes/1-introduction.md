## Scenario

The organizations you support have dynamic business needs for processing, updating data, and reporting. The SAP workloads are among the largest in your company.

SAP and Microsoft have a long history of working together in a strong partnership that has mutual benefits for their customers. Microsoft is constantly updating its platform and submitting new certification details to SAP in order to ensure Microsoft Azure is the best platform on which to run SAP workloads.

You understand and communicate risks, and suggest solutions using Azure to automate workloads. You connect SAP HANA to Power Platform and other Microsoft components to respond quickly and cost effectively to urgent business analysis needs.

## Learning objectives

You will:

- Discover the SAP and Microsoft partnership.
