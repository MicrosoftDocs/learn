A non-financial operational benefit, or "NFO", is an advantage provided by the implementation of a technology or approach that improves a system in a means other than purely cost.

Alternatives are examined to determine whether or not they exceed the requirements, meet requirements, or are not acceptable to meeting requirements.

Alternatives are also examined to determine whether their level of risk is High, Medium, or Low. Alternatives with the lowest amount of risk are preferred.

## Types of non-financial operational benefits

Non-financial operational benefits are denoted as Significant, Moderate, Low, or None.

Some examples of NFO's are improvements in

- **Performance**, which refers the response time of a system or systems. This is typically measured by the amount of time a user or users wait to receive a response after performing an action.
- **Availability**, which refers to the frequency of time that a workload is online to perform its designated function.
- **Securability**, which refers to how well a system or systems may be secured to protect against malicious intent.
- **Scalability**, which refers to the ability of a system to increase its resources available to achieve its workload purpose, either horizontally (adding more instances) or vertically (adding more computing power)
- **Elasticity**, which refers to the ability of a system to scale up or out to meet its workload purpose, and then scale down or in to original state to only use resources necessary
- **Maintainability**, which refers to how easily a system may be modified to either correct defects, improve performance, or increase functionality.
- **Accessibility**, which refers to the ability of a system or systems to accommodate as many different user needs and user types as possible.
- **Deployability**, which refers to the level of effort needed to provide workload capabilities to a user or groups of users.
- **Extensibility**, which refers to how easily a system or systems may be adapted to enhance capabilities, while minimizing time and cost.

## NFO identification purpose

As part of an Analysis of Alternatives process, it’s also very important to identify the non-financial operational benefits that utilizing US Sovereign Clouds will bring.

- **Workload sovereignty**. Utilizing US Sovereign Clouds allows an agency the ability to meet data sovereignty and data residency requirements of Federal mandates. It provides ultra-low latency to end users and extends the ability for the agency to provide its services to employees, support contractors, citizens, and soldiers globally.

- **Pro-active Cybersecurity posture.** Because Microsoft operates security operations centers, it provides users to proactively address cyber security challenges, while also enabling exponential growth.

- **Episodic growth**. Because federal, state, local, and tribal governments are constantly evolving in their efforts to govern, as needs arise, US Sovereign Clouds address these episodic shifts.

- **Inherent resiliency**. US Sovereign Clouds enable users to take advantage of resiliency that has already been architected for them, enable transparency of data and AI for data sharing, and helps to drive IT reform while also promoting operational excellence.

These are all non-financial benefits that US Sovereign Clouds provide that should be considered when evaluating US Sovereign Clouds.
