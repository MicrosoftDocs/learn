Azure Storage provides data protection for Blob Storage and Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 to help you to prepare for scenarios where you need to recover data that has been deleted or overwritten. It's important to think about how to best protect your data before an incident occurs that could compromise it.

## Recommendations for basic data protection

If you're looking for basic data protection coverage for your storage account and the data that it contains, then Microsoft recommends taking the following steps to begin with:

 -  Configure an Azure Resource Manager lock on the storage account to protect the account from deletion or configuration changes.<br>
 -  Enable container soft delete for the storage account to recover a deleted container and its contents.
 -  Save the state of a blob at regular intervals:
     -  For Blob Storage workloads, enable blob versioning to automatically save the state of your data each time a blob is overwritten.
     -  For Azure Data Lake Storage workloads, take manual snapshots to save the state of your data at a particular point in time.

 -  An Azure Resource Manager lock doesn't protect a container from deletion.
 -  Storage account deletion fails if there is at least one container with version-level immutable storage enabled.
 -  Container deletion fails if at least one blob exists in the container, regardless of whether policy is locked or unlocked.
 -  Overwriting the contents of the current version of the blob creates a new version. An immutability policy protects a version's metadata from being overwritten.
 -  While a legal hold or a locked time-based retention policy is in effect at container scope, the storage account is also protected from deletion.
 -  Not currently supported for Data Lake Storage workloads.
 -  AzCopy and Azure Data Factory are options that are supported for both Blob Storage and Data Lake Storage workloads. Object replication is supported for Blob Storage workloads only.

## Recover deleted or overwritten data

If you should need to recover data that has been overwritten or deleted, how you proceed depends on which data protection options you've enabled and which resource was affected. The following table describes the actions that you can take to recover data.

| **Deleted or overwritten resource** | **Possible recovery actions**                                               | **Requirements for recovery**                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

## Disaster recovery<br>

Azure Storage always maintains multiple copies of your data so that it's protected from planned and unplanned events, including transient hardware failures, network or power outages, and massive natural disasters. Redundancy ensures that your storage account meets its availability and durability targets even in the face of failures.

If a failure occurs in a data center, if your storage account is redundant across two geographical regions (geo-redundant), then you have the option to fail over your account from the primary region to the secondary region.<br>

Customer-managed failover isn't currently supported for storage accounts with a hierarchical namespace enabled.
