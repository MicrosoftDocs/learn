  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "Your production application has a normally heavy workload with a requirement for high concurrency. Which implementation of Azure Database for MySQL should you select?"
    choices:
    - content: "General purpose (2 - 1. vCores)"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The general purpose tier is designed for medium concurrency workloads."
    - content: "Memory optimized (2 - 1. vCores)"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Memory optimized is the best tier for high concurrency workloads."
    - content: "Burstable (1 - 2. vCores)"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The burstable tier is best suited to low-concurrency workloads, with occasional peaks."
  - content: "MySQL supports a pluggable storage engine architecture. You're porting your database to Azure Database for MySQL. Which storage engine should you select?"
    choices:
    - content: "MyISAM"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. MyISAM isn't supported on Azure Database for MySQL."
    - content: "CSV"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. CSV is supported on Azure Database for MySQL but would only be used for specific scenarios, not for the whole database."
    - content: "InnoDb"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. InnoDB is MySQL's default storage engine and is supported by Azure Database for MySQL."
  - content: "How does the query optimizer ensure that queries run efficiently?"
    choices:
    - content: "The query optimizer estimates the cost of different execution plans, using statistics provided by the MySQL daemon."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The MySQL daemon is the service program that starts all other MySQL services. It doesn't directly ensure that the query optimizer finds the most efficient execution plan."
    - content: "The query optimizer estimates the cost of different execution plans, using statistics provided by the storage engine."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. The query optimizer uses statistics provided by the relevant storage engine to find the most efficient execution plan."
    - content: "The query optimizer estimates the cost of different execution plans, using statistics provided by the EXPLAIN utility statement."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Explain displays the expected execution plan for a given query, it doesn't help the query optimizer to choose the most efficient execution plan."
