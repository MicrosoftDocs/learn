  - content: "Which of the following settings should be configured in a session configuration file to ensure that a special account with local administrative credentials is used during a JEA session instead of the connecting users account?"
    choices:
    - content: "SessionType"

      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The RunAsVirtualAccountGroup allows you to have the JEA session use a special virtual account that is a member of a specified security group, but unless this specified security group has been granted administrative privileges, does not provide any extra privileges to the virtual account."

    - content: "Session configuration file name"

    - content: "Role capability file name"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect: You need to have a role capability file to configure a JEA endpoint, but do not need to specify the file name when remotely connecting to that endpoint."
