    - content: "VisibleCmdlets"
      isCorrect: true

  - content: "Which of the following settings should be configured in a session configuration file to ensure that a special account with local administrative credentials is used during a JEA session instead of the connecting users account?"
    choices:
    - content: "SessionType"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The SessionType setting allows you to configure the sessions default settings but doesn't allow you to assign a special virtual account that has local administrative privileges."
    - content: "RunAsVirtualAccount"

    - content: "RunAsVirtualAccountGroup"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The RunAsVirtualAccountGroup allows you to have the JEA session use a special virtual account that is a member of a specified security group, but unless this specified security group has been granted administrative privileges, doesn't provide any extra privileges to the virtual account."
  - content: "In addition to the name of the remote computer being connected to, which of the following must be specified when connecting to a JEA endpoint using remote PowerShell?"
    choices:

    - content: "Session configuration file name"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect: You need to have a session configuration file to configure a JEA endpoint, but don't need to specify the file name when remotely connecting to that endpoint."
    - content: "Role capability file name"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect: You need to have a role capability file to configure a JEA endpoint, but don't need to specify the file name when remotely connecting to that endpoint."
