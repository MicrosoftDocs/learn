Just Enough Administration (JEA) is an administrative technology that allows you to apply role-based access control (RBAC) and the least privilege principles to Windows PowerShell remote sessions. Instead of assigning users broad roles that enable them to perform tasks that aren't directly related to a specific work requirement, JEA allows you to configure special Windows PowerShell endpoints that provide only the functionality necessary to perform a specific task.

- Describe JEA.
- Explain the limitations of JEA.
- Describe role capabilities files and their use in JEA.
