Having completed this module, you have the necessary knowledge to implement JEA as an administrative tool in Windows Server environments. You learned how to limit privileged operations to a set of specified PowerShell cmdlets, parameters, and variables, how to limit which users can connect to JEA endpoints and the level of privilege those users have when performing administrative tasks.

Now that you have reviewed this module, you should be able to:

- Explain the concept of Just Enough Administration (JEA)

- Define role group capabilities and session configurations for a JEA session
