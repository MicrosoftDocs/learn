Session configuration files are used to register a JEA (Just Enough Administration) endpoint. The session configuration file is responsible for naming the JEA endpoint. It also controls:

- Who can access the JEA endpoint
- What roles the user is assigned
- Which identity is used by JEA's virtual account.

Session configuration files use the .pssc file extension, and you create new session configuration files by using the **New-PSSessionConfigurationFile** cmdlet.

You can also use session configuration files to define which cmdlets and functions are available in a JEA session, just like you can with role capabilities files. In addition, you can configure the following settings unique to session configure files:

- SessionType. This setting allows you to configure the sessions default settings. The SessionType of RestrictedRemoteServer is used for sessions used by JEA for secure management.
- RoleDefinitions. This setting is used to assign role capabilities to specific security groups.
- RunAsVirtualAccount. This setting allows JEA to use the privileged virtual account created just for the JEA session. This account is a member of the local Administrators group and the Domain Admins group on domain controllers.
- TranscriptDirectory. This setting specifies where JEA activity transcripts are stored.
- RunAsVirtualAccountGroup. This setting allows you to specify the groups that the virtual account is a member of, instead of the default Administrators or Domain Admins groups.

For a list of all the options when creating session configuration files, see [New-PSSessionConfigurationFile](/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/new-pssessionconfigurationfile).
