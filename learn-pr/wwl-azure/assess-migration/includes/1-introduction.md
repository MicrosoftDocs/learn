You've decided to migrate your application to Azure. There are many things to consider before you make the move. In this module, we'll work through some of these considerations to ensure when you do migrate, you're prepared for success.

In this module we'll look at reasons to migrate to Azure, how to perform an assessment, explore the tools that can help the migration, and follow-up tasks to consider. We'll work through a cost calculator so you can have a sense of the investment you'll be making and explore ways you can do a phased migration so you can spread out both your work and your costs. 

Moving from an on-premise-based solution to a cloud-based solution isn't a step to take lightly. This course will help you become familiar and comfortable with the serious task before you. The investments you're making now to move to the cloud should set you and your business on firm footing for the future.
