Azure App Service provides built-in authentication and authorization support. You can sign in users and access data by writing minimal or no code in your web app, RESTful API, mobile back end, or Azure Functions.

## Why use the built-in authentication?

You're not required to use App Service for authentication and authorization. Many web frameworks are bundled with security features, and you can use them if you like. If you need more flexibility than App Service provides, you can also write your own utilities.

The built-in authentication feature for App Service and Azure Functions can save you time and effort by providing out-of-the-box authentication with federated identity providers, allowing you to focus on the rest of your application.

* Azure App Service allows you to integrate various auth capabilities into your web app or API without implementing them yourself.
* Auth is built directly into the platform and doesnâ€™t require any particular language, SDK, security expertise, or code.
* You can integrate with multiple login providers. For example, Microsoft Entra ID, Facebook, Google, X.

## Identity providers

App Service uses federated identity, in which a third-party identity provider manages the user identities and authentication flow for you. The following identity providers are available by default:

| Provider | Sign-in endpoint | How-To guidance |
|--|--|--|
| Microsoft Entra | `/.auth/login/aad` | [App Service Microsoft Entra platform login](/azure/app-service/configure-authentication-provider-aad) |
| Facebook | `/.auth/login/facebook` | [App Service Facebook login](/azure/app-service/configure-authentication-provider-facebook) |
| Google | `/.auth/login/google` | [App Service Google login](/azure/app-service/configure-authentication-provider-google) |
| X | `/.auth/login/x` | [App Service X login](/azure/app-service/configure-authentication-provider-twitter) |
| Any OpenID Connect provider | `/.auth/login/<providerName>` | [App Service OpenID Connect login](/azure/app-service/configure-authentication-provider-openid-connect) |
| GitHub | `/.auth/login/github` | [App Service GitHub login](/azure/app-service/configure-authentication-provider-github) |

When you configure this feature with one of these providers, its sign-in endpoint is available for user authentication and for validation of authentication tokens from the provider. You can provide your users with any number of these sign-in options.

## How it works

The authentication and authorization middleware component is a feature of the platform that runs on the same VM as your application. When enabled, every incoming HTTP request passes through it before being handled by your application.

The platform middleware handles several things for your app:

* Authenticates users and clients with the specified identity provider
* Validates, stores, and refreshes OAuth tokens issued by the configured identity provider
* Manages the authenticated session
* Injects identity information into HTTP request headers

The module runs separately from your application code and can be configured using Azure Resource Manager settings or using a configuration file. No SDKs, specific programming languages, or changes to your application code are required.

> [!NOTE]
> In Linux and containers the authentication and authorization module runs in a separate container, isolated from your application code. Because it doesn't run in-process, no direct integration with specific language frameworks is possible.

### Authentication flow

The authentication flow is the same for all providers, but differs depending on whether you want to sign in with the provider's SDK.

* Without provider SDK: The application delegates federated sign-in to App Service. This delegation is typically the case with browser apps, which can present the provider's login page to the user. The server code manages the sign-in process and is referred to as *server-directed flow* or *server flow*.

* With provider SDK: The application signs users in to the provider manually and then submits the authentication token to App Service for validation. This is typically the case with browser-less apps, which can't present the provider's sign-in page to the user. The application code manages the sign-in process and is referred to as *client-directed flow* or *client flow*. This applies to REST APIs, Azure Functions, JavaScript browser clients, and native mobile apps that sign users in using the provider's SDK.

The following table shows the steps of the authentication flow.

| Step | Without provider SDK | With provider SDK |
|--|--|--|
| Sign user in | Redirects client to `/.auth/login/<provider>`. | Client code signs user in directly with provider's SDK and receives an authentication token. For information, see the provider's documentation. |
| Post-authentication | Provider redirects client to `/.auth/login/<provider>/callback`. | Client code posts token from provider to `/.auth/login/<provider>` for validation. |
| Establish authenticated session | App Service adds authenticated cookie to response. | App Service returns its own authentication token to client code. |
| Serve authenticated content | Client includes authentication cookie in subsequent requests (automatically handled by browser). | Client code presents authentication token in `X-ZUMO-AUTH` header (automatically handled by Mobile Apps client SDKs). |

For client browsers, App Service can automatically direct all unauthenticated users to `/.auth/login/<provider>`. You can also present users with one or more `/.auth/login/<provider>` links to sign in to your app using their provider of choice.

### Authorization behavior

In the Azure portal, you can configure App Service with many behaviors when an incoming request isn't authenticated.

* **Allow unauthenticated requests:** This option defers authorization of unauthenticated traffic to your application code. For authenticated requests, App Service also passes along authentication information in the HTTP headers. This option provides more flexibility in handling anonymous requests. It lets you present multiple sign-in providers to your users.

* **Require authentication:** This option rejects any unauthenticated traffic to your application. This rejection can be a redirect action to one of the configured identity providers. In these cases, a browser client is redirected to `/.auth/login/<provider>` for the provider you choose. If the anonymous request comes from a native mobile app, the returned response is an `HTTP 401 Unauthorized`. You can also configure the rejection to be an `HTTP 401 Unauthorized` or `HTTP 403 Forbidden` for all requests.

    > [!CAUTION]
    > Restricting access in this way applies to all calls to your app, which may not be desirable for apps wanting a publicly available home page, as in many single-page applications.

### Token store

App Service provides a built-in token store, which is a repository of tokens that are associated with the users of your web apps, APIs, or native mobile apps. When you enable authentication with any provider, this token store is immediately available to your app.

### Logging and tracing

If you enable application logging, authentication and authorization traces are collected directly in your log files. If you see an authentication error that you didn't expect, you can conveniently find all the details by looking in your existing application logs.
