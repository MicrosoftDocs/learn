In this module, you explored how to use arrays and hash tables to manage data effectively in PowerShell scripts. You learned how to:

- **Create and manipulate arrays** to store multiple values and loop through them efficiently.
- **Build and use hash tables** to organize data as key-value pairs, enabling fast lookups and structured access.
- **Apply both data structures in scripts** to solve practical problems, such as tracking user information or system configurations.
- **Choose the right structure** based on your scripting needsâ€”arrays for ordered collections, hash tables for labeled data.
- **Write cleaner, more powerful scripts** by combining arrays and hash tables with control flow and iteration.
