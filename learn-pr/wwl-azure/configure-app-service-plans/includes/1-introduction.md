## Scenario

It's important to be able to scale a web app.

 -  Scaling enables the app to remain responsive during periods of high demand.
 -  Scaling helps to save money by reducing the resources required when demand drops.

Imagine that you work for a large chain of hotels. You have a website that customers can visit to make bookings and to view the details of bookings that they've previously made. At certain times of the year, the volume of traffic grows because customers are browsing hotels for summer vacations. At other times, traffic declines. These patterns are predictable.

You meet these goals providing scale up and down, and scale in and out. Your scaling choices depend on the App Service plan.
