Azure Administrators need to be able to scale a web application. Scaling enables an application to remain responsive during periods of high demand. Scaling also helps to save money by reducing the resources required when demand drops.

Suppose you work for a large chain of hotels. You're responsible for maintaining the hotel website. Customers visit the website to make new reservations and view details for their current bookings. At certain times of the year, the volume of website traffic grows because customers are browsing hotels for vacations during national/regional holidays. At other times, traffic declines. These website usage patterns are predictable.

In this module, you learn to implement Azure App Service plans. You learn how different App Service plans provide different pricing and scaling options. You learn how changing the plan affects performance.

The goal of this module is to ensure you can determine the best App Service plan for your application.
