In this module, you’ve learned how to design a solution to log and monitor Azure resources. You should now be able to:

- Identify the availability requirements of Azure resources 

- Recommend a high availability solution for Compute 

- Recommend a high availability solution for relational data storage 

- Recommend a high availability solution for non-relational data storage
