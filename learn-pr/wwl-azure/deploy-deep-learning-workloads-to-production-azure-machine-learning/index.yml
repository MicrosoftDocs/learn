title: Deploy deep learning workloads to production with Azure Machine Learning
summary: Deploying large-scale models for real-time inferencing is challenging because of the model's size. Learn what you can do and which frameworks you can use to optimize your model's performance during model scoring.
abstract: |
  In this module, you'll learn:
  - To choose the appropriate inference strategy
  - To optimize model scoring with ONNX
  - To deploy Triton as a managed online endpoint
prerequisites: |
  Before starting this module, you should be familiar with the Azure Machine Learning service and training machine learning and deep learning models.
