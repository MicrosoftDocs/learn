  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "Which of the following best describes the architecture of PostgreSQL?"
    choices:
    - content: "Client/server."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. PostgreSQL has a client/server architecture."
    - content: "Distributed."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. PostgreSQL doesn't have a distributed architecture."
    - content: "Relational."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. PostgreSQL doesn't have a relational architecture."
  - content: "You run a few complex queries on your PostgreSQL database. Which server parameter should you consider tuning to improve performance?"
    choices:
    - content: "**work_mem**"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. This parameter specifies the amount of memory that can be used by internal sort operations and hash tables. Complex queries may benefit from increasing the available memory."
    - content: "**max_connection**"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Max_connections specifies the maximum number of query connections at any one time, but won't help processing complex queries."
    - content: "**Shared_buffers**"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. shared_buffers defines the shared memory used by the server. Increasing the amount of memory available to the server will improve the performance of reading and writing to the database, but not returning the results from complex queries."
  - content: "Which server process is responsible for initiating and shutting down the PostgreSQL processes?"
    choices:
    - content: "Query optimizer."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The query optimizer is responsible for planning the most efficient way to execute queries."
    - content: "Postmaster daemon."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The postmaster daemon is the server process that is responsible for server start-up processes and shutting down the server."
    - content: "PostgreSQL backend processes."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The PostgreSQL backend processes are responsible for connection handling, and not starting and shutting down the server."
