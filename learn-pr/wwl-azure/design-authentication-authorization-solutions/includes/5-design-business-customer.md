[Azure AD B2C](/azure/active-directory-b2c/overview) is a type of Microsoft Entra tenant for managing customer identities and their access to your apps. Azure AD B2C requires a Microsoft Entra tenant, but this tenant _isn't_ the same as the Microsoft Entra tenant for your organization.
- The **Microsoft Entra tenant** represents your organization.
- The **Azure AD B2C tenant** represents the identities for your customer apps. 

After you set up your Azure AD B2C tenant, you must register your app. You use user flows to manage things like user sign-ins and sign-ups. Your Azure AD B2C tenant lets you create multiple types of user flows.

### Things to know about Azure AD B2C

You review the B2B features of Microsoft Entra ID and consider how they might be implemented in an identity solution for Tailwind Traders. Let's look at the customer features offered by Azure AD B2C.

- Azure AD B2C provides secure authentication for your customers by using their preferred identity providers.

- You can capture sign in, preference, and conversion data for your customers.

- Azure AD B2C stores custom attributes about customers so you can use the information in your apps.

- You can use branded registration and custom UI sign-in experiences.

- The B2C option lets you separate the organization account from the customer account.

### Things to consider when using Azure AD B2C

Tailwind Traders wants to investigate how to implement identity management for users who are customer of their products. Review the following points about using the Azure AD B2C solution.

- **Consider reusable flows for user journeys**. A user journey is the path that you want people to take in your app to achieve their goal. A Tailwind Traders user might want to make a new account, update their profile, or frequently check for other users. Azure AD B2C comes with preconfigured policies called [user flows](/azure/active-directory-b2c/user-flow-overview). You can reuse the same user flows across different apps. Reusing user flows creates a consistent user journey across all apps.

- **Consider allowing users to sign in with their social identities**. Support identity providers to enable Tailwind Traders users to sign in with their existing social or enterprise accounts. There's a long [list of identity providers](/azure/active-directory-b2c/add-identity-provider) and more are being added. Social providers include Amazon, Microsoft Entra ID, Facebook, LinkedIn, X, and Microsoft accounts. 

- **Consider a customizable user interface to support branding**. Customize the pages in your Tailwind Traders user flow. Write your own HTML and CSS or use built-in templates called [page layout templates](/azure/active-directory-b2c/customize-ui?pivots=b2c-user-flow).

- **Consider integration with external user stores**. Azure AD B2C provides a directory that can hold 100 custom attributes per user. However, integration with external systems is also an option. You can use Azure AD B2C for authentication, but delegate to an external customer relationship management (CRM) or customer loyalty database as the source of truth for customer data.

- **Consider third-party identity verification and proofing**. Use Azure AD B2C to facilitate identity verification and proofing for Tailwind Traders by collecting user data. Pass the data to a third-party system to perform validation, trust scoring, and approval for user account creation.
