Tailwind Traders is planning on making some significant changes to their identity and access management solution. They ask for your assistance on some recommendations and questions. Here are the specific requirements.

- **Device access to company applications**. The CTO agreed to allow some level of device access. Employees at the companyâ€™s retail stores require access to certain company applications. This access, however, should be restricted to only approved devices. 

- **Company reorganization**. A company-wide reorganization affects many employees. These employees are now in new roles. The IT team needs to ensure users have the correct access based on their new jobs. 

- **External developer accounts**. A new development project requires external software developers to access company data files. The IT team needs to create user accounts for approximately five developers.

- **User sign-in attempts**. A recent audit of user sign-ins attempts revealed anonymous IP addresses and unusual locations. The IT team wants to require multifactor authentication for these attempted sign-ins.
