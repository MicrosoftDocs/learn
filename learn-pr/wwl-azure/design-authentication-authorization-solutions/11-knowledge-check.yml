  title: ""
  questions:
  - content: "How can Tailwind Traders permit employees at their retail stores to access company apps from approved tablet devices only?"
    choices:
    - content: "Single sign-on (SSO)"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. SSO helps a user to remember only one ID and one password for multiple apps. SSO doesn't verify the device that's trying to access an app."
    - content: "Conditional access"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Conditional access lets you require users to access your apps from approved, or managed, devices only."
    - content: "Multifactor authentication (MFA)"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. MFA provides extra security for your identities. MFA doesn't verify the device that's trying to access the resource or app."
  - content: "What should Tailwind Traders do to ensure employees have the correct permissions for their job role?"
    choices:
    - content: "Create a conditional access policy"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Conditional access policies won't validate employee job role access."
    - content: "Review each user's role-based access control (RBAC) permissions"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Although RBAC might work, the process would be long and tedious. Also, IT personnel aren't in the best position to determine if an employee's access is correct."
    - content: "Require an access review"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. An access review will give managers an opportunity to validate the employee's access."
  - content: "What should Tailwind Traders do to give access to their partner developers?"
    choices:
    - content: "Use AD Connect to bring in the developer accounts"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. AD Connect is used to bring in on-premises accounts."
    - content: "Ask the developers to sign in with a social identification like Google, LinkedIn, or Facebook."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. External social accounts are used for business-to-customer (B2C) apps."
    - content: "Invite the developers as guest users to their directory"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. In business-to-business (B2B) scenarios, guest user accounts are created. You can then apply the appropriate permissions."
  - content: "What solution would be best for user sign-in attempt requirement?"
    choices:
    - content: "Create a user risk policy"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A user risk policy represents the probability a given identity or account is compromised. A scenario would be where a user's valid credentials are leaked."
    - content: "Create a sign-in risk policy"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. A sign-in risk policy can identify anonymous IP and atypical locations. Secondary MFA can then be required."
    - content: "Require an access review"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. An access review provides an opportunity to validate an employee's continued access to assets."
