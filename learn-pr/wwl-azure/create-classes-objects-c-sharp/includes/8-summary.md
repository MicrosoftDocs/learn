In this module, you learned about object-oriented programming (OOP) and how to create class definitions and instantiate objects in C#. You compared structured programming to object-oriented programming and explored custom classes in relation to the .NET type system. You also examined class definitions and constructors, and how to create objects using the `new` operator.

The main takeaways from this module include understanding the key concepts of OOP such as abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. You learned about C#, a strongly typed language where every variable, constant, and expression has a type. The module emphasized the importance of classes in OOP, which are the blueprints used to define the properties and methods of objects. You also learned about the role of class constructors in initializing new objects in class definitions, and how namespaces are used to organize classes in large projects.
