Structured programming and object-oriented programming (OOP) are two distinct approaches to software development, each with their own set of principles and methodologies.

- Structured programming is based on a top-down approach where the program is divided into smaller, manageable functions or procedures. This approach emphasizes a clear and logical flow of control through the use of loops, conditionals, and subroutines.
- Object-oriented programming is based on the concept of objects, which encapsulate both data and behavior. This approach promotes a modular and reusable code structure by organizing software design around objects that interact with each other.

While structured programming focuses on the sequence of actions to be performed, object-oriented programming emphasizes the objects involved in the actions.

## Structured programming

Structured programming is an approach to software development that emerged from the need to improve code clarity, code quality, and development time. It relies on the use of control structures such as loops, conditionals, and subroutines to create a clear and logical flow of control. In structured programming, the program is divided into smaller, manageable functions or procedures, each designed to perform a specific task. This modular approach allows for code reuse and easier debugging, as each function can be tested independently. However, as the complexity of the software increases, managing the interactions between these functions can become challenging.

Structured programming is well suited to small to medium-sized software projects where the focus is on the logical flow of control. It is particularly effective for procedural tasks that can be broken down into a series of steps. However, as the size and complexity of the software grow, structured programming can become unwieldy and difficult to maintain. In large applications, the linear and top-down approach of structured programming can lead to a tangled web of interdependent functions, making it hard to understand and modify the codebase.

## Object-oriented programming

Object-oriented programming is an approach to software development that focuses on the concept of objects, which encapsulate both data (attributes) and behavior (methods). In OOP, software design is based on *classes*, which serve as blueprints for creating *objects*. Each object represents a real-world entity and can interact with other objects through well-defined interfaces.

Object-oriented programming is well-suited for large, complex software systems, as it encourages a modular and maintainable code structure.

The relationship between classes and objects is examined during the remainder of this module.

## Transitioning from structured programming to object-oriented programming

Transitioning from structured programming to object-oriented programming can be challenging, as it requires a shift in mindset and a different approach to software design. However, the benefits of OOP, such as code reusability, modularity, and scalability, make it a valuable approach to programming that can be used to develop robust and maintainable software systems.

### Terms used to describe object-oriented programming

Object-oriented programming introduces terminology that may be new to you. You don't need to fully understand these terms to start using OOP, but it is helpful to recognize these terms as you learn more about OOP.

The following terms are often used when describing the concepts and benefits of OOP:

- **Abstraction**: Abstraction allows you to hide intricate implementation details while exposing a simplified set of data attributes and methods for the user to interact with. It serves as a boundary between the user and the inner workings of an object or system.
- **Encapsulation**: Encapsulation is the process of bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on that data into a single unit - a class. This unit hides the internal details of how data is stored or processed, exposing only a well-defined interface for interaction.
- **Inheritance**: Inheritance is the mechanism by which one class acquires the properties and behavior of another class. It allows you to create a new class that is based on an existing class, reusing the attributes and methods of the parent class.
- **Polymorphism**: Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. This enables you to write code that can work with objects of multiple types, providing flexibility and extensibility.

Recognizing these terms and understanding their significance can help you grasp the core concepts of object-oriented programming and apply them to your software development projects.
