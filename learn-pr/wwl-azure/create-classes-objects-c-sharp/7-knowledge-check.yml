  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "What is a `class` type in a C# program?"
    choices:
    - content: "An object stored in memory."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While a class is the blueprint for an object that is stored in memory, a class itself isn't stored in memory."
    - content: "Something for which you receive a letter grade."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Letter grades are awarded for educational classes, but that's not the type of class being discussed here."
    - content: "A blueprint that's used to create an object."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! A class defines what an object contains and what it can do."
  - content: "What is an object in a C# program?"
    choices:
    - content: "It's a term used to describe an entity or thing."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While the term object can be used in this way, in computer programming the term refers to the instantiation of a class."
    - content: "A data record that represents a single entity."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. An object isn't thought of as a data record."
    - content: "An object is an in-memory instance of a class."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! An object in an in-memory \"instance\" of a class."
  - content: "What is the role of a constructor in a class?"
    choices:
    - content: "It's used to release any resources which must be handled appropriately before the object is removed from memory."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Releasing resources is the role of a finalizer, not a constructor."
    - content: "It provides notifications about occurrences, such as button clicks or the successful completion of a method, to other objects."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Providing notifications is the role of events, not a constructor."
    - content: "It's called when the object is first created and is often used to initialize the data of an object."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. A constructor initializes the data of an object when it's first created."
  - content: "What is the purpose of class properties in C# programming?"
    choices:
    - content: "Class properties are used to define the actions (behaviors) that a class can perform."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Class methods, not properties, define the actions or behaviors that a class can perform."
    - content: "Class properties are used to organize large code projects."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Namespaces, not class properties, are used to organize large code projects."
    - content: "Class properties are used to manage the data that differentiates one object (class instance) from another object of the same type."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Class properties manage the data that differentiates one object from another of the same type."
  - content: "What is the purpose of a static constructor in a class?"
    choices:
    - content: "It can be called directly and multiple times throughout the program."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A static constructor can't be called directly and is only meant to be called by the common language runtime (CLR). It's invoked automatically and only once."
    - content: "It's used to initialize any instance field variables when an object is created."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Instance constructors, not static constructors, are used to initialize instance field variables when an object is created."
    - content: "It's used to initialize any static data, or to perform a particular action that needs to be performed only once."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. A static constructor is used to initialize any static data, or to perform a particular action that needs to be performed only once. It's called automatically before the first instance is created or any static members are referenced."
