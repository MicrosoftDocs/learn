An important security task is ensuring that your server has updates to software applied in a timely fashion. Windows Server Update Services (WSUS) provides infrastructure to download, test, and approve updates for on-premises Windows Server and Windows Client environments. When you install updates quickly—especially security updates—you help block attacks based on the vulnerabilities addressed by the update.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you will:

- Describe the role of WSUS
- Describe the WSUS update management process
- Deploy updates with WSUS

## Prerequisites

- Experience performing basic Windows Server administration tasks

> [!NOTE]
> While WSUS is deprecated from Windows Server 2025 onward, it remains functional in Windows Server 2025 through the operating system's supported lifespan. You can continue to use WSUS with Windows Server 2025, but should plan to move to an alternative update management system.
