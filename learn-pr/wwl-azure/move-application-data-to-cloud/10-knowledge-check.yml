  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "If there's performance degradation of a system after migration, which of the following approaches might best help troubleshoot?"
    choices:
    - content: "Check the IP firewall"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Evaluating the firewall is mainly related to security not query performance."
    - content: "Check the results of Azure's Data Migration Assistant"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The migration assistant helps when first migrating but doesn't provide insight about why a query may not be optimal."
    - content: "Investigate query wait statistics"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Query wait statistics can help in identifying queries that need tuning and can also shed light on potential infrastructure upgrades that would be beneficial"
  - content: "If a company  wanted to move an existing on-premises database system to the cloud with no modifications to their current settings, which migration approach might be best for them?"
    choices:
    - content: "Move from on-premises SQL Server to Cosmos DB on Azure"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This approach would involve moving the data from one DB type to another."
    - content: "Use Hybrid Benefit"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Hybrid Benefit allows the use of on-premises licenses on Azure's database deployments but doesn't relate to system settings."
    - content: "Use the Rehosting option"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Rehosting is an option where application is moved from an on-premises server into the IaaS environment of Azure, avoiding modifications to the system."
  - content: "If an organization stores numerous Word documents and images, which storage deployment would be ideal for this type of data?"
    choices:
    - content: "Structured data"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Structured data is uniform in nature not ideal for binary files that have little to no common elements."
    - content: "Semi-structured data"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Semi structured data is ideal for data that has a hierarchy but may not have clear field relationships with other data objects. A JSON object is a good example."
    - content: "Unstructured data"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Unstructured data (like blob storage) is best suited for files like documents or images."
