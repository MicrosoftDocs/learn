Once you've moved to Azure's cloud, ensuring you're getting the most out of your migrated resources will be an ongoing business need. Because the cloud continually provides new and optimized resources, examining what's available regularly can help you get the most out of your workloads and implementation.

## Cost optimization

Microsoft Cost Management provides a solution that you can use to start analyzing costs immediately in Power BI with a set of reports. Here are a few of examples of reports that can help you understand your costs.

- **Billing account overview**: A high-level view of the costs across your organization, use the Billing account overview report. It helps you quickly identify spending trends across your organization. The report shows a monthly summary of information, including charges against credits, new purchases and overages and total charges.
- **Usage by Subscriptions and Resource Groups**: Provides a cost over time view and charts showing cost by subscription and resource group. You can use this to get a more fine-grained view of the costs in your organization.
- **Top 5 Usage drivers**: Shows a filtered cost summarization by the top 5 MeterCategory and corresponding MeterName. For example, maybe your networking costs for your eCommerce app increased last month.

## Save money with Azure Hybrid Benefit and reservations

Azure Hybrid Benefit is a licensing benefit that helps you to significantly reduce the costs of running your workloads in the cloud. It works by letting you use your on-premises Software Assurance-enabled Windows Server and SQL Server licenses on Azure. And now, this benefit applies to RedHat and SUSE Linux subscriptions, too.

If you're already using your benefit, then use the Windows Server AHB Usage report to identify the servers that have AHB enabled. When you're not using your benefit, the report shows you where you can use it. In either case, the report helps maximize your benefit usage by showing recommendations that help save you money. Because of the complicated nature of the benefit, the report can give you confidence to fully use your Windows Server licensing benefit without unintentionally exceeding it.

If your organization has purchased Azure reservations, then the Microsoft Cost Management Power BI app can help you manage them, view cost-saving recommendations, and maximize your reservation use. The VM RI Coverage reports provide recommendations for VM RI purchases, even you haven't already made any reservation purchases.

You save the most money when a reservation is fully used. When a reservation isn't fully used, your maximum possible savings are reduced.

## Modernize for long-term value

Your move to the cloud is a first step towards modernizing your infrastructure and making it more "future proof." As you think about how you can modernize your databases and other services, these ideas can help guide you in a direction that will give you the most out of your migration.

### Rehosting

Rehosting is also referred to as a lift-and-shift migration. The application is moved from an on-premises server into the IaaS environment of Azure, avoiding modifications to the system. With this approach, cloud benefits are quickly unlocked, and you can take advantage of advanced cloud capabilities, such as autoscaling and improved resiliency, while gradually modernizing afterwards. This is particularly true of database workloads.

### End of service opportunities

Many companies will stop providing updates and service support for software they deliver to customer sites. This is no better time to move to the cloud. End of support means there will be no further updates, including regular security updates. With the increasing sophistication and frequency of cyberattacks, running apps and data on unsupported software can create significant security and compliance risks.

### Application modernization

Shifting app services to a cloud architecture has many advantages. This move also makes it easier for apps to take advantage of features users have come to expect. Moving your application or applications to Azure has these benefits (among others).

- Managed services let you focus on apps not admin and speed up deployments
- Smaller instances increase packing density and improve resource utilization
- Managed services support all stacks. Containers run on any cloud
- Fast and agile app deployment with built-in DevOps and instant startup
- Environments are consistent across development, test, and production
