  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "What is the benefit of using Kubernetes Deployments instead of scheduling individual pods?"
    choices:
    - content: "Deployments allow for more resource allocation to each pod"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Deployments don't allocate more resources to each pod, but rather manage a group of identical pods."
    - content: "Deployments provide higher security for the pods"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Deployments don't provide higher security for the pods, but rather ensure high availability and redundancy."
    - content: "Deployments enable automation and validation of the creation and teardown of environments to help deliver secure and stable application hosting platforms"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Deployments enable automation and validation of the creation and teardown of environments, which helps deliver secure and stable application hosting platforms by ensuring high availability and redundancy."
  - content: "What is the purpose of a StorageClass in AKS?"
    choices:
    - content: "To determine the access mode of the persistent volume"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The access mode is determined by the PersistentVolumeClaim, not the StorageClass."
    - content: "To define the size of the persistent volume claim"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The StorageClass defines storage characteristics, not size."
    - content: "To define storage characteristics and the reclaim policy for underlying Azure storage resources"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The StorageClass defines the type of Azure storage to create and the reclaim policy for the underlying storage resource."
  - content: "What is the purpose of creating a custom storage class in an AKS cluster?"
    choices:
    - content: "To deploy a pod with a persistent volume mount"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A custom storage class is created before creating a persistent volume claim."
    - content: "To list the content of a directory in the AKS cluster"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Listing the content of a directory isn't related to creating a custom storage class."
    - content: "To define the properties of a persistent volume that will be used by a persistent volume claim"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. A custom storage class defines the properties of a persistent volume that will be used by a persistent volume claim, such as the storage class name, the provisioner, and the reclaim policy."
  - content: "What are the storage options available for AKS containerized workloads?"
    choices:
    - content: "Use only Azure Premium SSD v2 for applications that require consistently low latency, high I/O operations per second (IOPS), and high throughput."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Azure Premium SSD v2 is one of the options for block level access to data, but it isn't the only option."
    - content: "Use only Azure NetApp Files for shared application data that requires high performance."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Azure NetApp Files is one of the options for file level access to data, but it isn't the only option."
    - content: "Choose from platform managed databases, disks, and file and blob storage."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. AKS supports both stateless and stateful workloads. To accommodate this requirement, you can apply a range of native Azure services, including managed databases, disks, and file and blob storage. Each of these options offers different SKUs, sizes, and performance characteristics."
