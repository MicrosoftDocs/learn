Your first assignment involves creating a new user account, adding a license to enable access to essential services. Next, you're inviting an external user to collaborate on a project. After that, you assign a specific role to a user to grant appropriate permissions. Finally, you perform a bulk import of users and user data to streamline the onboarding process.
