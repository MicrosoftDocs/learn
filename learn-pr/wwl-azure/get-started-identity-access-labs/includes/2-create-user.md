In your new role at Contoso, you're tasked with managing user accounts. You ensure that employees and external partners have the necessary access to company resources. Your first assignment involves creating a new user account, adding a license to enable access to essential services. Next, you're inviting an external user to collaborate on a project. After that, you assign a specific role to a user to grant appropriate permissions. Finally, you perform a bulk import of users and user data to streamline the onboarding process. These tasks are fundamental to maintaining an organized and secure identity management system within Microsoft Entra.
