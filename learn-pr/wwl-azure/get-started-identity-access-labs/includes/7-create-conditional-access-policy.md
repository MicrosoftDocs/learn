As you wrap up your initial onboarding at Contoso, your final task involves configuring Conditional Access policies. Policies enhance security and control access to company resources. In this lab, you will create a new Conditional Access policy to prevent users from accessing Microsoft Sway. You goal is to ensure that only authorized personnel can use this application. Additionally, you will use the "What If" analysis tool to simulate the potential impact of your policy changes. A what if analysis, allows you to understand and fine-tune a policy before it goes live. These steps are essential for maintaining a secure and compliant environment within Microsoft Entra.
