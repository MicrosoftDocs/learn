As you continue to enhance the security measures at Contoso, your next task is to configure and enable Self-Service Password Reset (SSPR). This feature allows users to reset their passwords independently, reducing the workload on the IT support team. This change improves overall security and efficiency. In this lab, you enable SSPR, configure the necessary settings, and ensure that only the designated users have access. By implementing SSPR, you empower users to manage their passwords securely and conveniently.
