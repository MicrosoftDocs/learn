As you advance in your role at Contoso, you're now responsible for managing Multifactor Authentication (MFA) settings to enhance the security of user accounts. In this lab, you enable and disable per-user MFA settings. Enabling MFA ensures users have an extra layer of protection when accessing company resources. You review MFA settings such as Trusted IPs to allow secure access from specific locations. Finally, you configure MFA lockout settings to prevent unauthorized access attempts and protect sensitive information. These tasks are crucial for maintaining a secure and resilient identity management system within Microsoft Entra.
