As you continue your journey at Contoso, your next task involves managing groups to efficiently organize users and streamline access to resources. In this lab, you will create a security group and a Microsoft 365 group. These groups ensure that users are properly categorized based on their roles and responsibilities. You will add users to these groups and assign licenses to ensure they have access to the necessary resources. Group management tasks are essential for maintaining a structured and secure environment within Microsoft Entra. This allows you to manage permissions and resources more effectively.
