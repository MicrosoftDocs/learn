  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "How do you access a class that is in another namespace?"
    choices:
    - content: "Provide a link to the other namespace."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. You do not create links to other namespaces to access them."
    - content: "You don't need to do anything, namespaces are global and their contents are available everywhere."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This answer is incorrect, as namespaces are not global."
    - content: "Prefix your object with the name of the namespace it belongs to."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! The way you access objects in another namespace is prefix the name of your object with the name of the class that belongs to it."
  - content: "Why would two classes be in the same namespace?"
    choices:
    - content: "To avoid collisions."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Although classes are put in separate namespaces to avoid crashes, classes are not put in the same namespace to avoid crashes (class naming conflicts)."
    - content: "Because they are of the same type."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Classes of the same name/type are put in different namespaces to avoid name conflicts."
    - content: "Because they perform related functionality."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! Classes are put in namespaces to avoid name conflicts and because they share related functionality."
