This module starts you off on your journey of understanding and working with classes in C#. Classes are perhaps the most basic and important building block of an object-oriented application. They're a blueprint, of sorts, for objects you create.

Suppose you as a programmer want to build an application that designs a home. How would you go about it? You might start off with a house class. Your house class holds other objects such as rooms, floors, etcetera. You begin your application development journey by discovering the classes your application will need.

## Learning objectives

- Describe a class
- Differentiate between a class and an object
