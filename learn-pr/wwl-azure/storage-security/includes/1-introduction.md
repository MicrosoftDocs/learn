Every organization has data. That data needs to be protected at rest, in transit, and while it's being used within an application. Azure provides a set of security features to protect your data, no matter where it's located.

## Scenario

A security engineer will protect data within databases, file shares, or anywhere it resides, you'll work on such tasks as:

 -  Lock down access to storage to specific users and applications.
 -  Encrypt data where it's stored and while it's moved around.
 -  Use identity to protect data when it's accessed and used.

## Skills measured

Locking down applications and data is a part of [Exam AZ-500: Microsoft Azure Security Engineer](/certifications/exams/az-500).
