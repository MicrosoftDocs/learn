This module covers the topic of managing user accounts, service accounts, and group objects in Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) using Windows Server. It also discusses the creation and management of computer objects and organizational units (OUs).

## Scenario

You also need to create and manage computer objects and OUs. The challenge is to do this efficiently and securely, ensuring that users can authenticate to the AD DS domain and access network resources, services run smoothly, and access to resources is properly managed.

 -  Define users, groups, and computers.

 -  Manage objects and their properties in Active Directory.
 -  Create objects in Active Directory.
 -  Configure objects in Active Directory.
