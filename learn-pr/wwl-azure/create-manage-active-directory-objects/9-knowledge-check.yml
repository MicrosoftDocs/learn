  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "A system administrator is tasked with managing service accounts for various applications running on multiple servers. The administrator wants to simplify password management and SPN management. What should the administrator use to accomplish this task?"
    choices:
    - content: "User accounts in AD DS"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. User accounts in AD DS are used for user authentication and access control, not for managing service accounts."
    - content: "Local System accounts"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Local System accounts are local to the computer and do not provide centralized administration or simplified password and SPN management."
    - content: "Group managed service accounts"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Group managed service accounts provide automatic password maintenance and simplified SPN management for services running on multiple servers."
  - content: "Which of the following is a built-in container in an AD DS domain that can hold computer accounts?"
    choices:
    - content: "The Domain Controllers OU"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Although the Domain Controllers OU is an OU, it is created by default and is therefore built in."
    - content: "The IT OU"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. OUs are not built-in objects but are manually created (with one exception)."
    - content: "System"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Although this is a built-in container, it does not contain computer objects."
  - content: "A system administrator needs to manage a collection of users, computers, contacts, and other groups as a single entity in Active Directory. What should the administrator do to accomplish this task?"
    choices:
    - content: "Create a new user account"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Creating a new user account provides an individual with access permissions and resources, but it does not allow for managing a collection of users and resources as a single entity."
    - content: "Create an Organizational Unit"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While creating an Organizational Unit provides a hierarchical framework for organizing objects, it does not directly allow for managing a collection of users and resources as a single entity."
    - content: "Create a new group"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Creating a group in Active Directory allows for managing a collection of users, computers, contacts, and other groups as a single entity."
