  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "A system administrator is tasked with managing service accounts for various applications running on multiple servers. The administrator wants to simplify password management and SPN management. What should the administrator use to accomplish this task?"
    choices:
    - content: "User accounts in AD DS"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. User accounts in AD DS are used for user authentication and access control, not for managing service accounts."
    - content: "Local System accounts"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Local System accounts are local to the computer and don't provide centralized administration or simplified password and SPN management."
    - content: "Group managed service accounts"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Group managed service accounts provide automatic password maintenance and simplified SPN management for services running on multiple servers."
  - content: "Which of the following is a built-in container in an AD DS domain that can hold computer accounts?"
    choices:
    - content: "Computers container"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. The Computers container holds all computers joined to the domain without a computer account. It's the default location for new computer accounts created in the domain."
    - content: "Users container"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The Users container holds additional predefined user and group accounts (besides those in the Builtin container). Users and groups are pre-assigned membership and permissions for completing domain and forest management tasks."
    - content: "System container"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The System container holds configuration information about the domain including security groups and permissions, the domain SYSVOL share, DFS configuration information, and IP security policies."
  - content: "A system administrator needs to manage a collection of users, computers, contacts, and other groups as a single entity in Active Directory. What should the administrator do to accomplish this task?"
    choices:
    - content: "Create a new user account"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Creating a new user account provides an individual with access permissions and resources, but it doesn't allow for managing a collection of users and resources as a single entity."
    - content: "Create an Organizational Unit"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While creating an Organizational Unit provides a hierarchical framework for organizing objects, it doesn't directly allow for managing a collection of users and resources as a single entity."
    - content: "Create a new group"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Creating a group in Active Directory allows for managing a collection of users, computers, contacts, and other groups as a single entity."
