## Objectives

 -  **Task 1**: Create a resource group and deploy the Prerequisite web app
    - Use a template to create the virtual machines. You can review the [lab template](https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/AZ-700-Designing-and-Implementing-Microsoft-Azure-Networking-Solutions/blob/master/Allfiles/Exercises/M07/template.json).
    - Use Azure PowerShell to deploy the template. 
 -  **Task 2**: Create a virtual network and bastion host
 -  **Task 3**: Create a test virtual machine
 -  **Task 4**: Create a private endpoint
 -  **Task 5**: Configure the private DNS zone
 -  **Task 6**: Test connectivity across the private endpoint
