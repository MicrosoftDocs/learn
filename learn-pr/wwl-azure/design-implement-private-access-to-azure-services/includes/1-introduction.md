Azure provides a range of services and features to enhance the security and privacy of your network connections, including Virtual Network Service Endpoints, Azure Private Link, Private Endpoint, and Azure Private Link Service. These technologies allow for secure and direct connectivity to Azure services over the Azure backbone network, replacing public endpoints with private network interfaces, and providing granular access control.

Imagine you're a cloud architect for a large organization that is migrating its existing applications to Azure. You need to ensure that these applications can securely access specific Azure services without exposing them to the public internet. Additionally, you want to provide private access from your Azure virtual network to Azure PaaS services and Microsoft Partner services. You also need to restrict network access to certain PaaS resources and create a private endpoint for an Azure web app. This scenario requires a deep understanding of Azure's networking services and how to implement them effectively.

In this module, you learn to:
- Describe and implement Virtual Network Service Endpoints in Azure for secure and direct connectivity. 
- Use Azure Private Link and Private Endpoint to replace public endpoints with private network interfaces. 
- Use Azure Private Link Service to provide private access from your Azure virtual network to Azure PaaS services and Microsoft Partner services.
