## Lab scenario

Virtual network service endpoints enable you to limit network access to Azure service resources in a subnet. You can also remove internet access to the resources. Service endpoints provide direct connection from your virtual network to supported Azure services, letting you use your virtual network's private address space to access the Azure services. Traffic destined to Azure resources through service endpoints always stays on the Microsoft Azure backbone network.
