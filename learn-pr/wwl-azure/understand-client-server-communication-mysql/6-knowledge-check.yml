quiz:
  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "MySQL Workbench is a query interface tool. What tasks can be carried out in MySQL Workbench?"
    choices:
    - content: "Displaying context sensitive help related to queries you're trying to execute."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. MySQL Workbench displays context sensitive help relating to queries you want to execute."
    - content: "Compare and synchronize data and schemas."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. MySQL Workbench can't compare and synchronize data and schemas."
    - content: "Sending alerts to administrator's email accounts."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. MySQL Workbench can't be used to send alerts by email."
  - content: "For best performance on Azure Database for MySQL, how should you manage connection handling?"
    choices:
    - content: "Short-lived connections."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. If you have many short-lived concurrent connections and experience connection failures, you may not be optimizing connection handling."
    - content: "Connection pooling."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Connection pooling can improve performance when you have limited resources and many concurrent connections."
    - content: "Set **max_connections** to the minimum possible value."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Setting max_connections to an appropriate value is part of connection handling, but won't directly improve performance."
  - content: "How do you enable backups in Azure Database for MySQL?"
    choices:
    - content: "Do nothing, databases will automatically be backed up once a day."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Azure Database for MySQL takes full backups once daily. If a backup fails, the backup tries every 20 minutes until a successful backup is made."
    - content: "Configure the backup parameters in **Server parameters**."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. You don't need to configure a parameter in Server parameters to enable backups in Azure Database for MySQL."
    - content: "Use the **mysqldump** utility."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. MySQLdump is a utility that creates a logical backup for MySQL installations. You only need to use mysqldump if you want to retain backups beyond the 35 days currently supported by Azure Database for MySQL."
  - content: "How are new connections handled by Azure Database for MySQL?"
    choices:
    - content: "Each new connection is responsible for creating a connection in the connection pool."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The client doesn't create a connection in the connection pool each time a new connection is made."
    - content: "Each new connection must wait until the connection pool is available to create a new connection."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. New connections don't have to wait for a new connection thread."
    - content: "Each new connection uses a connection from the connection pool."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. The connection pool maintains a number of connections available for new client connections."
