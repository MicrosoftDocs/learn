## Overview of secure score

Microsoft Defender for Cloud has **two** main goals:

 -  To help you **understand** your current security situation
 -  To help you **efficiently** and **effectively** improve your security

The central feature in Defender for Cloud that enables you to achieve those goals is the secure score.

Defender for Cloud continually assesses your cross-cloud resources for security issues. It then **aggregates all the findings into a single score** so that you can tell, at a glance, your current security situation: the **higher the score**, the **lower the identified risk level**.

 -  In the Azure portal pages, the secure score is shown as a **percentage value**, and the underlying values are also clearly presented:

 -  In the Azure mobile app, the secure score is shown as a percentage value, and you can tap the secure score to see the details that explain the score:

To increase your security, review Defender for Cloud's **recommendations page** and remediate the recommendation by implementing the remediation instructions for each issue. **Recommendations are grouped into security controls**. Each control is a **logical group of related security recommendations** and **reflects your vulnerable attack surfaces**. Your score only improves when you ***remediate all*** of the recommendations for a ***single resource within a control***. To see how well your organization is securing each individual attack surface, review the scores for each security control.

## How your secure score is calculated

:::image type="content" source="../media/security-controls-large-2c356a99.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing Microsoft Defender for Cloud recommendations page.":::


To get all the possible points for security control, all of your **resources must comply with all of the security recommendations within the security control**. **For example**, Defender for Cloud has multiple recommendations regarding how to secure your management ports. You'll need to remediate them all to make a difference to your secure score.

## Example scores for a control

:::image type="content" source="../media/remediate-vulnerabilities-control-large-354f7019.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing Microsoft Defender for Cloud example scores for a control.":::


**In this example**:

 -  Remediate vulnerabilities security control - This control group has multiple recommendations related to discovering and resolving known vulnerabilities.
 -  Max score - The maximum number of points you can gain by completing all recommendations within a control. The maximum score for a control indicates the relative significance of that control and is fixed for every environment. Use the max score values to triage the issues to work on first.
 -  Current score - The current score for this control.
    
    Current score = \[**Score per resource**\] \* \[**Number of healthy resources**\]
    
    Each control contributes towards the total score. In this example, the control is contributing **2.00 points** to the current total secure score.
 -  Potential score increase - The remaining points available to you are within your control. If you remediate all the recommendations in this control, your score will increase by 9%.
    
    Potential score increase = \[**Score per resource**\] \* \[**Number of unhealthy resources**\]
 -  Insights - Gives you extra details for each recommendation, such as:
    
    
     -  :::image type="content" source="../media/preview-icon-d9b46adc.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the preview recommendation icon that provides extra detail.":::
         **Preview recommendation** \- This recommendation won't affect your secure score until **general availability (GA)**.
     -  :::image type="content" source="../media/fix-icon-c7b18e7c.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the fix icon that enables you to resolve issues.":::
         **Fix** \- From within the recommendation details page, you can use '**Fix**' to resolve this issue.
     -  :::image type="content" source="../media/enforce-icon-cd64da95.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the enforce icon that enables you to automatically deploy a policy to fix an issue.":::
         **Enforce** \- From within the recommendation details page, you can automatically deploy a policy to fix this issue whenever someone creates a non-compliant resource.
     -  :::image type="content" source="../media/deny-icon-4444b813.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the deny icon that enables you to prevent new resources from being created with identified issues.":::
         **Deny** \- From within the recommendation details page, you can prevent new resources from being created with this issue.

### Which recommendations are included in the secure score calculations?

 -  Only built-in recommendations have an impact on the secure score.
 -  Recommendations flagged as Preview aren't included in the calculations of your secure score. They should still be remediated wherever possible so that when the preview period ends, they'll contribute towards your score.
 -  Preview recommendations are marked with: :::image type="content" source="../media/preview-icon-d9b46adc.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the preview recommendations icon for secure score options after General Availability.":::
    

## Improve your secure score

To improve your secure score, remediate security recommendations from your recommendations list. You can remediate each recommendation manually for each resource or use the **Fix option** (**when available**) to resolve an issue on multiple resources quickly.

You can also configure the Enforce and Deny options on the relevant recommendations to improve your score and make sure your users don't create resources that negatively impact your score.

## Frequently asked questions (FAQ) Secure score

### If I address only three out of four recommendations in security control, will my secure score change?

No. It won't change until you remediate all of the recommendations for a single resource. To get the maximum score for a control, you must remediate all recommendations for all resources.

### If a recommendation isn't applicable to me, and I disable it in the policy, will my security control be fulfilled and my secure score updated?

Yes. We recommend disabling recommendations when they're inapplicable in your environment.

### If a security control offers me zero points toward my secure score, should I ignore it?

In some cases, you'll see a control max score greater than zero, but the impact is zero. When the incremental score for fixing resources is negligible, it's rounded to zero. Don't ignore these recommendations because they still bring security improvements. The only exception is the "**Additional Best Practice**" control. Remediating these recommendations won't increase your score, but it will enhance your overall security.
