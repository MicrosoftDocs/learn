Software as a Service (SaaS) is software that is centrally hosted and managed for the end customer. It allows users to connect to and use cloud-based apps over the internet. Common examples are email, calendars, and office tools such as Microsoft 365.

SaaS is typically licensed through a monthly or annual subscription, and Microsoft 365 is an example of SaaS software.
