quiz:
  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "Which of the following options is a potential disadvantage of a purely horizontal strategy when migrating SAP systems to Microsoft Azure?"
    choices:
    - content: "There's no opportunity to gain experience with production systems on Azure prior to the migration."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. A horizontal strategy allows the user to evaluate the potential cost savings, performance, and optimization of their migration strategy in a less-important environment, without significant risk to mission-critical functions on higher layers."
    - content: "If something goes wrong, large numbers of users or mission-critical business functions are likely to be affected."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A horizontal strategy allows the user to evaluate the potential cost savings, performance, and optimization of their migration strategy in a less-important environment, without significant risk to mission-critical functions on higher layers."
    - content: "There's no opportunity to analyze potential cost savings, performance, and optimization potential."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A horizontal strategy allows the user to evaluate the potential cost savings, performance, and optimization of their migration strategy in a less-important environment, without significant risk to mission-critical functions on higher layers."
  - content: "Why is classical migration commonly referred to as \"two-step migration\", while the SAP database migration option (DMO) is referred to as \"one-step migration\"?"
    choices:
    - content: "Classical migration is a manual process, while DMO is automated."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While it's true that classical migration is a manual process, while DMO is automated, isn't the reason for the terminology."
    - content: "Classical migration involves a database migration and an SAP update, while DMO only includes a database migration."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. DMO facilitates both an SAP upgrade and a database migration to the SAP HANA database via one tool."
    - content: "DMO carries out a database migration and an SAP upgrade as a single step, while in classical migration they're separate steps."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. DMO facilitates both an SAP upgrade and a database migration to the SAP HANA database via one tool. While it's true that classical migration is a manual process, while DMO is automated, isn't the reason for the terminology."
  - content: "Which file transfer mode should be selected during a one-step migration, to minimize migration downtime?"
    choices:
    - content: "Parallel Data Transfer"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. In Parallel Data Transfer mode, data is immediately transferred to the Azure target after the export is completed for each file via the dmotocloud.sh script. This mode can be used to minimize migration downtime."
    - content: "Sequential Data Transfer"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. In Parallel Data Transfer mode, data is immediately transferred to the Azure target after the export is completed for each file via the dmotocloud.sh script. This mode can be used to minimize migration downtime."
    - content: "Both modes result in the same migration downtime"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. In Parallel Data Transfer mode, data is immediately transferred to the Azure target after the export is completed for each file via the dmotocloud.sh script. This mode can be used to minimize migration downtime."
  - content: "Broadly speaking, the potential for DMO performance optimizations can be seen in which three areas?"
    choices:
    - content: "CPU, I/O, memory"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Broadly speaking, the potential for DMO performance optimizations can be seen in the following three areas: Export, file transfer, import."
    - content: "Network speed, bandwidth, latency"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Broadly speaking, the potential for DMO performance optimizations can be seen in the following three areas: Export, file transfer, import."
    - content: "Export, file transfer, import"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Broadly speaking, the potential for DMO performance optimizations can be seen in the following three areas: Export, file transfer, import."
