  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "An administrator wants to create a reusable template that uses the custom script extension to configure web content on a VM. What's the best way to enable deployments to specify the script that configures web content?"
    choices:
    - content: "Provide a variable that specifies the script location."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Although variables can help make your templates easier to maintain, they're not the best choice when making your templates configurable or reusable."
    - content: "Provide a default script location in your template, and then use a nested template to override that location."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Although you can use a nested template to override default values, it could make your deployments more complex than necessary."
    - content: "Provide a parameter that specifies the script location."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Parameters promote reuse. Their values are filled in when the template runs."
  - content: "What's meant by declarative automation in the context of deploying VMs by using templates?"
    choices:
    - content: "Defining the required resources in addition to the steps needed to create those resources."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. For example, think about what's in a Resource Manager template. A Resource Manager template defines only the end state, but not how to get to that end state."
    - content: "Defining the required resources but not how to create those resources."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. In the case of Resource Manager templates, Resource Manager takes care of these details for you."
    - content: "Defining the required resources with the system ensuring that those resources are always available."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. In the case of Resource Manager templates, it's still up to you to deploy and manage your resources after you've written your template."
  - content: "Which of the following statements about Azure VM disks is true?"
    choices:
    - content: "There will be only one operating system disk in each Azure VM, and its maximum size is 32 TB."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The maximum size for the operating system disk is 2 TB."
    - content: "The maximum number of data disks you can attach to the Azure VM is dependent on the Azure VM size."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Different sizes offer different storage opportunities."
    - content: "The number and disk size of temporary disks is dependent on the size of the Azure VM."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Although the size of temporary disk is dependent on VM size, the number is limited to 1."
