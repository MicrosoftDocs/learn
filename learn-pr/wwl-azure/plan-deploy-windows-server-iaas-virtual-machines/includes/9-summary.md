The Contoso IT Engineering team wanted to consider the ways to implement VMs in Azure, minimize the configuration steps for deploying VMs, optimize the cost, and improve performance.

In this module, you learned to describe Azure compute and Azure storage in relation to Azure VMs. You also learned how to deploy Azure VMs by using the Azure portal, by using Cloud Shell, and by using templates. Finally, you learned about additional options for optimizing your Windows Server infrastructure.

You can now provide feedback to the deployment team at Contoso about cost and performance, how best to size a Windows Server IaaS VM, and how to deploy Azure VMs in various ways.
