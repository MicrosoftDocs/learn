C# offers powerful tools like enums, structs, and records. These tools help developers write clean, maintainable, and efficient code by organizing data and improving readability.

Imagine you're a developer on an e-commerce platform. Order statuses like 'Pending' or 'Shipped' need to be managed in a way that prevents mistakes. The statuses need to group customer details like name and address into a compact structure, and handle API responses with data that can't be changed. With the right tools, your code can avoid clutter and becoming error-prone. Enums, structs, and records in C# help you organize data, ensure reliability, and make your code easier to maintain.

## Learning objectives

- Use enums in C# to define named constants and prevent invalid values.
- Work with structs in C# to encapsulate related data into lightweight containers.
- Create records in C# to model immutable data and ensure consistency.

## Prerequisites

- Visual Studio Code installed with the C# Dev Kit.
- Basic knowledge of the Visual Studio Code Integrated Development Environment (IDE).
- Basic understanding of the C# programming language.
- Familiar with classes, abstract classes, interfaces and inheritance.
