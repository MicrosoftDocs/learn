In this module, you learned about enums, which organize predefined, mutually exclusive values and support features like bit flags and extension methods. You also explored structs, which encapsulate related data into lightweight containers, emphasizing immutability and performance. Finally, you studied records, which model immutable data with value-based equality, offering concise syntax and built-in functionality for common operations.

After completing this module, you're now able to:  

- Use enums to define and manage sets of fixed values, including implementing bit flags and extension methods.  
- Design and implement structs for encapsulating related data, ensuring immutability and efficient performance.  
- Create and utilize records for modeling immutable data with value-based equality and hierarchical structures.
