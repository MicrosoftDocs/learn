  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "What is the primary purpose of using enums in C#?"
    choices:
    - content: "To define a set of named constants for fixed values."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Enums are used to represent a set of predefined values with meaningful names, improving code readability and maintainability."
    - content: "To store multiple values in a single variable."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Enums don't store multiple values; they represent a single value from a predefined set of constants."
    - content: "To perform mathematical operations on integral types."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Enums aren't designed for mathematical operations but for representing fixed sets of values."
  - content: "What keyword is used to define a struct in C#?"
    choices:
    - content: "Struct"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The 'struct' keyword is used to define a struct in C#. It allows creating a value type that encapsulates related data."
    - content: "Class"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The 'class' keyword is used to define reference types, not value types like structs."
    - content: "Interface"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The 'interface' keyword is used to define contracts for classes or structs, not the struct itself."
  - content: "What is the primary advantage of using records in C# for data modeling?"
    choices:
    - content: "They allow for mutable properties by default."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Records are immutable by default, which is one of their key advantages for data integrity."
    - content: "They support complex behavior-focused operations."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Records are designed for simple, immutable data models rather than complex behavior-focused operations."
    - content: "They provide value-based equality and immutability."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Records offer value-based equality and immutability, making them ideal for scenarios where data shouldn't change after creation."
