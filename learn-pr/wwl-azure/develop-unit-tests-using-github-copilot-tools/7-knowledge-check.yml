  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "What is the role of GitHub Copilot Chat in generating unit test cases?"
    choices:
    - content: "It automatically writes all the test cases for the solution."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. GitHub Copilot Chat does not automatically write all the test cases for a solution. It does generate unit tests based on the code specified by the user."
    - content: "It only suggests possible input parameters and expected output values."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While GitHub Copilot Chat does suggest possible input parameters and expected output values, it also suggests assertions and can help identify edge cases and boundary conditions."
    - content: "It helps generate unit tests based on the code files and selections specified by the user."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. GitHub Copilot Chat helps generate code snippets for test cases, suggesting possible inputs, outputs, assertions, and identifying edge cases and boundary conditions."
  - content: "What is the purpose of the Test Explorer in Visual Studio Code?"
    choices:
    - content: "To write new code snippets for unit tests."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The Test Explorer is not used to write new code snippets, but to manage and run existing unit tests."
    - content: "To run and debug unit tests, view the results of test runs, and manage test cases in the workspace."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The Test Explorer is used to run and debug unit tests, view test results, and manage test cases in the workspace."
    - content: "To generate test cases based on the code context."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The Test Explorer does not generate test cases, but provides a user interface to manage and run existing test cases."
  - content: "What is the purpose of generating assertions to ensure that function input parameters are valid?"
    choices:
    - content: "To enhance the performance of the function."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Generating assertions for function input parameters is not primarily done to enhance performance."
    - content: "To prevent invalid data from being processed by the function."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Generating assertions for function input parameters helps prevent invalid data from being processed by the function."
    - content: "To check if the function returns the expected output."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Generating assertions for function input parameters is not primarily done to check the function's output."
  - content: "What does the GitHub Copilot extension for Visual Studio Code provide when creating unit tests for specific conditions?"
    choices:
    - content: "It provides a user interface for manually writing tests."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. GitHub Copilot does not provide a user interface for writing tests. GitHub Copilot suggests completions and generates tests."
    - content: "It automatically runs the tests and provides the results."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. GitHub Copilot does not run tests. GitHub Copilot helps generate them."
    - content: "It suggests completions and generates tests based on the code context."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. GitHub Copilot suggests completions and generates tests based on the code context."
  - content: "What is the benefit of using GitHub Copilot for generating unit tests?"
    choices:
    - content: "It reduces the need for manual testing."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While GitHub Copilot helps generate unit tests, it does not eliminate the need for manual testing."
    - content: "It can suggest a range of unit tests based on the code context, saving development time."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. GitHub Copilot can suggest a range of unit tests based on the code context, which can save development time."
    - content: "It automatically fixes bugs in the code."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. GitHub Copilot does not fix bugs. GitHub Copilot helps generate unit tests."
