Unit testing is a crucial aspect of software development that ensures the functionality of individual components within a system.

This module introduces how to generate unit tests with GitHub Copilot and GitHub Copilot Chat in Visual Studio Code. The module focuses on using the Chat view, inline chat, and code completions to create unit tests for the xUnit testing framework. Visual Studio Code and the C# Dev Kit extension are used to create a unit test project and manage unit tests.

Imagine you're a software developer working on a large codebase. Your team is tasked with ensuring code reliability. You determine that unit tests are needed for most of the codebase. However, creating unit tests manually can be time-consuming and error-prone. You need a tool that helps you develop unit tests quickly and accurately. The tool should also help identify edge cases and boundary conditions. You hear that GitHub Copilot can accelerate the development of unit tests and help to identify edge cases. You're looking forward to developing unit tests more quickly and accurately using GitHub Copilot.

The topics covered in this module include:

- Creating unit tests in Visual Studio Code using GitHub Copilot and GitHub Copilot Chat.
- Creating specific unit tests for edge cases and boundary conditions using GitHub Copilot Chat.
- Creating unit test projects and managing unit tests in Visual Studio Code.
- Completing a "create unit tests" challenge and reviewing a possible solution.

By the end of this module, you're able to use GitHub Copilot and Visual Studio Code tools to efficiently create, manage, and run unit tests. Using GitHub Copilot improves the reliability of your codebase and saves valuable development time.

> To complete this GitHub Copilot training, you must have an active subscription for GitHub Copilot in your personal GitHub account (includes the GitHub Copilot Free plan), or you must be assigned to a subscription managed by an organization or enterprise. Module activities may include GitHub Copilot suggestions that match public code. If you're a member of an organization on GitHub Enterprise Cloud who has been assigned a GitHub Copilot subscription through your organization, the setting for suggestions matching public code may be inherited from your organization or enterprise. If your account blocks suggestions that match public code, module activities may not work as expected.
