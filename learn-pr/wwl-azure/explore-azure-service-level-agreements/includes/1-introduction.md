Now that you are actively thinking of building solutions on Azure, how can you determine the reliability of the cloud services?  Is there a system in place to confirm your infrastructure is up and server customers? Ultimately, you want to know that your solutions are active and available.  In your on-premises datacenter, you knew how reliable the hardware was, as you controlled everything.  And you knew exactly how long it would take to replace hardware if a problem occurred.  Let's take a look at Service Level Agreements (SLAs) in order to give you peace-of-mind.

In this module, we will discuss what types of Service Levels are available in Azure and how to calculate the up-time of your solutions based on the products and services you choose to use for your solutions.
