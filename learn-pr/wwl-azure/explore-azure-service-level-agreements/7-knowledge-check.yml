  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "Which of the following answers define performance targets, like uptime, for an Azure product or service?"
    choices:
    - content: "Service-Level Agreements"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. The SLA defines performance targets for an Azure product or service."
    - content: "Support Plans"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect.  Support plans are used to define how you will get support when an issue occurs."
    - content: "Usage Meters"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect.  Usage meters track the amount of consumption, so you can estimate and control costs."
  - content: "You have two services with different SLAs. The composite SLA is determined by?"
    choices:
    - content: "Adding the SLAs percentages together"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect.  You need to multiply the values."
    - content: "Multiplying the SLAs percentages together"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. To determine a composite SLA, you multiply the individual SLAs together."
    - content: "Taking the lowest SLA percentage"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect.  You need to multiply the different SLA values together."
  - content: "Deploying an app can be done directly to what level of physical granularity?"
    choices:
    - content: "Region"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's Correct. Azure organizes infrastructure around regions, which include multiple datacenters. You can pick the region you want resources deployed into. You can't select a specific datacenter or location within a datacenter."
    - content: "Datacenter"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect.  You cannot control exactly which datacenter your app is deployed."
    - content: "Server rack"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect.  You have no control over what server rack and app is deployed to."
  - content: "To use Azure datacenters that are made available with power, cooling, and networking capabilities independent from other datacenters in a region, choose a region that supports _________?"
    choices:
    - content: "Geography distribution"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Geography distribution helps make sure that your app stays up even if a failure in a datacenter occurs."
    - content: "Service-Level Agreements (SLAs)"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Service-Level Agreements ensure how much up time is guaranteed for your app once deployed."
    - content: "Availability Zones"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's Correct. Availability Zones are datacenters set up to be an isolation boundary from others in the region, with their own power, cooling, and networking. If one zone in a region goes down, other Availability Zones in the region continue to work."
  - content: "Application availability refers to what?"
    choices:
    - content: "The Service-Level Agreement of the associated resource."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect.  Service-Level Agreement is your estimate of how much up time your application will have based on the services it is running on."
    - content: "Application support for an availability zone."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Application support for an availability zone is how you would get support for your application if it goes down for some reason."
    - content: "The overall time that a system is functional and working."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's Correct. The time that a system is working is referred to as the application availability."
