This tutorial provided a comprehensive overview of SQL `JOIN` operations in PostgreSQL, focusing on how to retrieve related data from multiple tables in a relational database.

You should now be able to use various types of JOINs including `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, `RIGHT JOIN`, `FULL OUTER JOIN`, and `NATURAL JOIN` to combine data across normalized tables using primary and foreign keys. 

By acquiring these techniques, you're well-equipped to construct complex queries, build unified result sets and generate meaningful insights through reports, dashboards, and data-driven applications.
