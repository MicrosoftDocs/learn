This guided project consists of the following exercises:

- Update the virtual network
- **Manage virtual machines**
- Control storage access
- Manage tags and locks
- Clean up

In this exercise, you’ll manage the virtual machine. You’ll change the VM’s assigned subnet, vertically scale the VM, add storage, and finally add an automatic shutdown.

Launch the exercise and follow the instructions. When you're done, be sure to return to this page so you can continue learning.
