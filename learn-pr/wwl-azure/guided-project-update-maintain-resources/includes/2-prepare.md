This is a guided project, where you complete a series of tasks. It is essential to complete the units in order. Each unit requires resources and configuration from previous units to function correctly.

## Project overview
In this guided project, you perform a series of tasks and actions to manage Microsoft Azure resources. You have the opportunity to modify a network, move a virtual machine between subnets, manage access to storage containers and file shares, and work with resource locks and resource tags.

> [!WARNING]
> This project requires an Azure subscription. Leaving resources provisioned and in use after completion of will result in additional costs. It is important to keep track of resources you create and ensure they are removed during the clean-up task at the end of this project.

## Setup
The scenario for the project is that you’ll be managing Microsoft Azure resources. You should already be familiar with simple tasks such as creating a virtual machine or virtual network. This **Prepare** exercise creates a basic set of Azure resources that you will then go in and manage or update during the actual scenario.

During the setup, you’ll create a virtual network, a virtual machine, a storage account, and associated resources.

Launch the exercise and follow the instructions. When you're done, be sure to return to this page so you can continue learning.
