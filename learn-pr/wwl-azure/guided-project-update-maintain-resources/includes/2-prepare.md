This is a guided project, where you complete a series of tasks. It is essential to complete the units in order. Each unit requires resources and configuration from previous units to function correctly.

## Project overview
In this guided project, you perform a series of tasks and actions to manage Microsoft Azure resources. You have the opportunity to modify a network, move a virtual machine between subnets, manage access to storage containers and file shares, and work with resource locks and resource tags.

> [!WARNING]
> This project requires you to provide an Azure subscription. Leaving resources provisioned and running after completion of the exercise may result in unexpected costs. It is important to keep track of resources you create to ensure you remove them during the clean-up task.

## Setup
The scenario for the project focuses on managing Microsoft Azure resources. You should already be familiar with tasks such as creating a virtual machine or virtual network. The **Prepare** exercise creates a basic set of Azure resources. The resources from the prepared exercise are used in the rest of the scenario.

During the setup, you create a virtual network, a virtual machine, a storage account, and associated resources.

Launch the exercise and follow the instructions. When you're done, be sure to return to this page so you can continue learning.
