    choices:
    - content: "Single Azure Virtual Machines"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Two or more virtual machines in different availability zones in the same Azure region offer a 99.99% uptime SLA."
    - content: "Two or more virtual machines in the same Availability Set"
      isCorrect: false

    - content: "Two or more virtual machines in different availability zones in the same Azure region"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Two or more virtual machines in different availability zones in the same Azure region offer a 99.99% uptime SLA."
  - content: "Can availability sets be deployed in Azure availability zones?"
    choices:
    - content: "No, they can't."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. It isn't possible to deploy Azure availability sets within an Azure availability zone. Choose one or the other as a deployment framework for virtual machines."
    - content: "Yes, they can."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. It isn't possible to deploy Azure availability sets within an Azure availability zone. Choose one or the other as a deployment framework for virtual machines."

    choices:
    - content: "2-tier"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. In 2-tier configurations, users install the database and NetWeaver components on the same Azure Virtual Machine to avoid network contention. In 3-tier configurations, database and application components are installed on separate Azure Virtual Machines."
    - content: "3-tier"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. In 2-tier configurations, users install the database and NetWeaver components on the same Azure Virtual Machine to avoid network contention. In 3-tier configurations, database and application components are installed on separate Azure Virtual Machines."
    - content: "Single virtual machine"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. In 2-tier configurations, users install the database and NetWeaver components on the same Azure Virtual Machine to avoid network contention. In 3-tier configurations, database and application components are installed on separate Azure Virtual Machines."
