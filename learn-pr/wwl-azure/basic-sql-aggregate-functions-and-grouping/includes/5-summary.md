This tutorial is designed to equip learners with the skills to summarize and organize data using aggregate functions and grouping techniques in SQL. 
You'll learn how to apply functions like COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, and MAX, and how to group and filter data using the GROUP BY and HAVING clauses.
By the end, you will be able to:

-Understand the role of aggregate functions in data analysis, which return a single value based on multiple rows.
-Use COUNT to count all rows or distinct values in a column.
-Use SUM to calculate the total of values in a numeric column.
-Use AVG to compute the average of numeric values in a column.
-Use MIN and MAX to find the lowest and highest values in a column.
-Group data using GROUP BY to apply aggregate functions to each group.
-Differentiate between GROUP BY and DISTINCT, and use GROUP BY even without aggregate functions to list unique values.
-Use HAVING to filter grouped results based on aggregate function outcomes.
