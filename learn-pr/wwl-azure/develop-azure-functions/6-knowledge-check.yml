  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "Which of the following choices is required for a function to run?"
    choices:
    - content: "Binding"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Bindings connect resources to a function, but aren't required for a function to run."
    - content: "Trigger"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. A trigger defines how a function is invoked and a function must have exactly one trigger."
    - content: "Both triggers and bindings"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Only a trigger is required for a function to run."
  - content: "Which of the following choices supports both the `in` and `out` direction settings?"
    choices:
    - content: "Bindings"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Input and output bindings use `in` and `out`."
    - content: "Trigger"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Triggers only support the `in` direction."
    - content: "Connection value"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A connection value is used to connect your function to other Azure services."
  - content: "In the Node.js v4 programming model, how are triggers and bindings configured?"
    choices:
    - content: "In code using the `@azure/functions` package"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Node.js v4 is code-first; you declare inputs/outputs in code and the runtime generates function.json."
    - content: "By editing function.json directly in the Azure portal"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Editing function.json is for older models like Node.js v3; v4 uses code-first configuration."
    - content: "By adding entries to host.json"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. host.json controls host-wide settings, not per-function bindings."
