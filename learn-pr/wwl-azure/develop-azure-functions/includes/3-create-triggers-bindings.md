A trigger defines how a function is invoked and a function must have exactly one trigger. Triggers have associated data, which is often provided as the payload of the function.

Binding to a function is a way of declaratively connecting another resource to the function; bindings might be connected as *input bindings*, *output bindings*, or both. Data from bindings is provided to the function as parameters.

You can mix and match different bindings to suit your needs. Bindings are optional and a function might have one or multiple input and/or output bindings.

Triggers and bindings let you avoid hardcoding access to other services. Your function receives data (for example, the content of a queue message) in function parameters. You send data (for example, to create a queue message) by using the return value of the function.

When you develop your functions locally, you need to take trigger and binding behaviors into consideration. For HTTP triggers, you can call the HTTP endpoint on the local computer, using `http://localhost/`. For non-HTTP triggered functions, there are several options to run locally:

* The easiest way to test bindings during local development is to use connection strings that target live Azure services. You can target live services by adding the appropriate connection string settings in the `Values` array in the local.settings.json file. When you do this, local executions during testing use live service data. Because of this, consider setting-up separate services to use during development and testing, and then switch to different services during production.
* For storage-based triggers, you can use the local [Azurite emulator](/azure/storage/common/storage-use-azurite) when testing functions with Azure Storage bindings (Queue Storage, Blob Storage, and Table Storage), without having to connect to remote storage services.
* You can manually run non-HTTP trigger functions by using special administrator endpoints. For more information, see [Manually run a non HTTP-triggered function](/azure/azure-functions/functions-manually-run-non-http).

## Trigger and binding definitions

Triggers and bindings are defined differently depending on the development language.

| Language | Configure triggers and bindings by... |
|--|--|
| C# class library | decorating methods and parameters with C# attributes |
| Java | decorating methods and parameters with Java annotations |
| JavaScript/PowerShell/Python/TypeScript | updating *function.json* schema |

For languages that rely on *function.json*, the portal provides a UI for adding bindings in the **Integration** tab. You can also edit the file directly in the portal in the **Code + test** tab of your function. 

In .NET and Java, the parameter type defines the data type for input data. For instance, use `string` to bind to the text of a queue trigger, a byte array to read as binary, and a custom type to deserialize to an object. Since .NET class library functions and Java functions don't rely on *function.json* for binding definitions, they can't be created and edited in the portal. C# portal editing is based on C# script, which uses *function.json* instead of attributes.

For languages that are dynamically typed such as JavaScript, use the `dataType` property in the *function.json* file. For example, to read the content of an HTTP request in binary format, set `dataType` to `binary`:

```json
{
    "dataType": "binary",
    "type": "httpTrigger",
    "name": "req",
    "direction": "in"
}
```

Other options for `dataType` are `stream` and `string`.

## Binding direction

All triggers and bindings have a direction property in the *function.json* file:

* For triggers, the direction is always `in`
* Input and output bindings use `in` and `out`
* Some bindings support a special direction `inout`. If you use `inout`, only the **Advanced editor** is available via the **Integrate** tab in the portal.

When you use attributes in a class library to configure triggers and bindings, the direction is provided in an attribute constructor or inferred from the parameter type.

## Azure Functions trigger and binding example

Suppose you want to write a new row to Azure Table storage whenever a new message appears in Azure Queue storage. This scenario can be implemented using an Azure Queue storage trigger and an Azure Table storage output binding.

Here's a *function.json* file for this scenario.

```json
{
  "disabled": false,
    "bindings": [
        {
            "type": "queueTrigger",
            "direction": "in",
            "name": "myQueueItem",
            "queueName": "myqueue-items",
            "connection":"MyStorageConnectionAppSetting"
        },
        {
          "tableName": "Person",
          "connection": "MyStorageConnectionAppSetting",
          "name": "tableBinding",
          "type": "table",
          "direction": "out"
        }
  ]
}
```

The first element in the `bindings` array is the Queue storage trigger. The `type` and `direction` properties identify the trigger. The `name` property identifies the function parameter that receives the queue message content. The name of the queue to monitor is in `queueName`, and the connection string is in the app setting identified by `connection`.

The second element in the `bindings` array is the Azure Table Storage output binding. The `type` and `direction` properties identify the binding. The `name` property specifies how the function provides the new table row, in this case by using the function return value. The name of the table is in `tableName`, and the connection string is in the app setting identified by `connection`.

### C# function example

Following is the same example represented in a C# function. The same trigger and binding information, queue and table names, storage accounts, and function parameters for input and output are provided by attributes instead of a *function.json* file.

```csharp
public static class QueueTriggerTableOutput
{
    [FunctionName("QueueTriggerTableOutput")]
    [return: Table("outTable", Connection = "MY_TABLE_STORAGE_ACCT_APP_SETTING")]
    public static Person Run(
        [QueueTrigger("myqueue-items", Connection = "MY_STORAGE_ACCT_APP_SETTING")]JObject order,
        ILogger log)
    {
        return new Person() {
                PartitionKey = "Orders",
                RowKey = Guid.NewGuid().ToString(),
                Name = order["Name"].ToString(),
                MobileNumber = order["MobileNumber"].ToString() };
    }
}

public class Person
{
    public string PartitionKey { get; set; }
    public string RowKey { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public string MobileNumber { get; set; }
}
```
