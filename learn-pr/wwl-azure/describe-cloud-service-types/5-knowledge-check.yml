quiz:
  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "Which cloud service type is most suited to a lift and shift migration from an on-premises datacenter to a cloud deployment?"
    choices:
    - content: "Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "With an IaaS service type, you can approximate your on-premises environment, making a lift-and-shift transition to the cloud relatively straightforward."
    - content: "Platform as a Service (PaaS)"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The PaaS service type may not provide the configuration flexibility to perform a lift-and-shift migration to the cloud. PaaS is generally better suited for deploying complete environments, like a development environment, where you want to focus on operations instead of configuration and maintenance of the underlying infrastructure."
    - content: "Software as a Service (SaaS)"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The SaaS service type is geared towards providing software solutions. Much of the infrastructure configuration is predetermined, preventing the configuration and control necessary for a lift-and-shift migration."
  - content: "What type of cloud service type would a Finance and Expense tracking solution typically be in?"
    choices:
    - content: "Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "IaaS provides access to hardware and infrastructure to create your own custom environment."
    - content: "Platform as a Service (PaaS)"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "PaaS provides access to platforms that have the operating system, development tools, and middleware installed and maintained by the cloud provider. Itâ€™s a middle point between IaaS and SaaS."
    - content: "Software as a Service (SaaS)"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "SaaS provides access to software solutions, such as finance and expense tracking, email, or ticketing systems."
