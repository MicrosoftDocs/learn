To create and use Azure services, you first need to sign up. If you’ve never tried or paid for Azure before, you can sign up for the Azure free account.

You'll need a valid credit card to create your Azure free account. This card is used for identity validation only. Your card won't be charged until you choose to upgrade.

> [!Important]
> This exercise is optional. You don't need to create an Azure account to go through most of the Microsoft Learn modules on Azure. If you already signed up, or if you aren't ready to sign up now, you can skip this unit.

## Sign up for a free account
1. In a web browser, go to [https://azure.microsoft.com/free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free?azure-portal=true).

2. Scroll down through the page to learn more about the benefits and free services available.

3. Select **Start free**.

4. Sign in with your Microsoft or GitHub account or create a free Microsoft account.

5. On the **About you page**, select your correct country or region. Enter your first and last name, email address, and phone number. Depending on your country, you might see additional fields, such as a VAT number. Select **Next** to continue.

6. On the **Identity verification by phone** screen, select your country code, and type the number of a telephone to which you have immediate access.

7. You have the option of text or callback to obtain a verification code. Select the relevant button, type the code in the **Verification code** box, and select **Verify code**.

8. If the verification code is correct, you're asked to enter details of a valid credit card. Enter the card information and select **Next**.

9. The last step is to review the agreement and privacy statement then select **Sign up**.

Congratulations! You have successfully set up a free account, and should be on the Azure portal home page.
