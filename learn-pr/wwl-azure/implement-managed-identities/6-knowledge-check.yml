  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "Which of the following managed identity characteristics is indicative of user-assigned identities?"
    choices:
    - content: "Shared lifecycle with an Azure resource"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. User-assigned identities have an independent lifecycle from the resources they're associated with."
    - content: "Independent life-cycle"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. User-assigned identities exist independently from the resources they're associated with and must be explicitly deleted."
    - content: "Can only be associated with a single Azure resource"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The same user-assigned managed identity can be associated with more than one Azure resource."
  - content: "When an Azure resource uses a managed identity to request an access token for a resource, which Microsoft Entra ID identity does the token represent?"
    choices:
    - content: "OAuth 2.0"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. OAuth 2.0 is the protocol used to request tokens, not the identity represented in the token."
    - content: "The managed identity’s service principal"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The access token represents the managed identity’s service principal in Microsoft Entra ID."
    - content: "The virtual machine (or hosting resource) itself"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The resource can have a managed identity, but the token represents the identity (service principal), not the VM object."
