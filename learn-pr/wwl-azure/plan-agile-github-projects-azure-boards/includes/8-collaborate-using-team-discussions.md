GitHub discussions can help make your team plan together, update one another, or talk about any topic you'd like in discussion posts on your team's page in an organization.

You can use team discussions for conversations that span across projects or repositories (issues, pull requests, etc.). Instead of opening an issue in a repository to discuss an idea, you can include the entire team by having a conversation in a team discussion.

With team discussions, you can:

 -  Post on your team's page or participate in a public discussion.
 -  Link to any team discussion to reference it elsewhere.
 -  Pin important posts to your team's page.
 -  Receive email or web notifications.

Team discussions are available in organizations by default.

You can also use organization discussions to facilitate conversations across your organization.
