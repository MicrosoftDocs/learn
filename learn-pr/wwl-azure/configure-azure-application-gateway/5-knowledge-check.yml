  questions:
  - content: "Which criteria does Application Gateway use to route requests to a web server?"
    choices:
    - content: "The hostname, port, and path in the URL of the request."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. An Application Gateway uses the hostname, port and URL path."
    - content: "The region in which the servers hosting the web application are located."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The Application Gateway does not directly use the region to route requests."
    - content: "The users authentication information."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The Application Gateway does not consider user authentication information when routing requests."
  - content: "Which load balancing strategy does the Application Gateway implement?"
    choices:
    - content: "Distributes requests to each available server in a backend pool in turn, round-robin."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The Application Gateway distributes requests using round-robin."
    - content: "Distributes requests to the server in the backend pool with the lightest load."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The Application gateway does not consider workloads."
    - content: "Polls each server in the backend pool in turn, and sends the request to the first server that responds."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The Application Gateway does not use polling."
  - content: "The web team is installing the Application Gateway. They want to ensure incoming requests are checked for common security threats like cross-site scripting and crawlers. To address the concerns what should be done?"
    choices:
    - content: "Install an internal load balancer"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. An internal load balancer would not be the best choice in this scenario."
    - content: "Install Azure Firewall"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. An Azure Firewall would not be the best choice in this scenario."
    - content: "Install the Web Application Firewall"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The Web Application Firewall is an optional component that handles incoming requests before they reach a listener. The Web Application Firewall checks each request for many common threats, based on the Open Web Application Security Project."
