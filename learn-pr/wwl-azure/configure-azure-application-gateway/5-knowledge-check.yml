    - content: "The hostname, port, and path in the URL of the request."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Application Gateway uses the hostname, port, and URL path."      
    - content: "The users authentication information."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Application Gateway doesn't consider user authentication information when routing requests."

  - content: "Which load-balancing strategy does Azure Application Gateway implement?"
    choices:
    - content: "Requests are distributed to the server in the back-end pool with the lightest load."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Application Gateway doesn't review workloads."
    - content: "Each server in the back-end pool is polled in turn, and the request is sent to the first server that responds."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Application Gateway doesn't implement polling."
    - content: "Requests are distributed to each available server in a back-end pool in turn via a round-robin technique."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Application Gateway distributes requests across multiple servers by using a round-robin technique."
  
  - content: "How can the concerns about security threats be addressed?"
    choices:
    - content: "Install Azure Web Application Firewall."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Azure Web Application Firewall is an optional component that handles incoming requests before they reach a listener. Web Application Firewall checks each request for many common threats, based on the Open Web Application Security Project."    
    - content: "Install an internal load balancer."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. An internal load balancer isn't the ideal solution to address the security threats."
