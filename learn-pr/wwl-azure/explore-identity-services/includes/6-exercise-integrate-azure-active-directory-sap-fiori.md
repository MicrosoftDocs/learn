### Configure Microsoft Entra single sign-on

1. Open a new web browser window and sign in to your SAP Fiori company site as an administrator. Make sure that http and https services are active and that the relevant ports are assigned to transaction code SMICM.
2. Sign in to SAP Business Client for SAP system T01, where single sign-on is required. Then, activate HTTP Security Session Management. Go to transaction code SICF\_SESSIONS and review the profile parameters. Adjust the parameters based on your organization requirements and restart the SAP system.
3. Activate the following SICF services:

     - **/sap/public/bc/sec/saml2**
     - **/sap/public/bc/sec/cdc\_ext\_service**
     - **/sap/bc/webdynpro/sap/saml2**
     - **/sap/bc/webdynpro/sap/sec\_diag\_tool** (This is only to enable / disable trace)
4. Go to transaction code SAML2 in Business Client for SAP system \[T01/122\]. The configuration UI opens in a new browser window. Enter your username and password, and then select **Log on**.
5. In the **Provider Name** box, replace **T01122** with ``` <http://T01122> ```, and then select **Save**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > By default, the provider name is in the format **\_sid-client\_**. Microsoft Entra ID expects the name in the format **protocol://name**. We recommend that you maintain the provider name as **https:// \_sid-client\_** so you can configure multiple SAP Fiori ABAP engines in Microsoft Entra ID.
6. Select **Local Provider** tab / **Metadata**. In the **SAML 2.0 Metadata** dialog box, download the generated metadata XML file and save it on your computer.
7. In the Azure portal, in the **SAP Fiori application integration** pane, select **Single sign-on**.
8. In the **Select a single sign-on method** pane, select **SAML** or **SAML/WS-Fed** mode to enable single sign-on.
9. In the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** pane, select **Edit** (the pencil icon) to open the **Basic SAML Configuration** pane.
10. In the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, select **Upload metadata file** and use the **Upload metadata file** option to upload the metadata file you downloaded earlier.
11. When the metadata file is successfully uploaded, the **Identifier** and **Reply URL** values are automatically populated in the **Basic SAML Configuration** pane. In the **Sign on URL** box, enter a URL that has the following pattern: **https://\[your company instance of SAP Fiori\]**.
12. The SAP Fiori application expects the SAML assertions to be in a specific format. The claims including **givenname**, **surname**, **emailaddress**, **name**, and **Unique User Identifier**. To manage their values, in the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** pane, select **Edit**.
13. In the **User Attributes &amp; Claims** pane, configure the SAML token attributes. Then, complete the following steps:

     - Select **Edit** to open the **Manage user claims** pane.
     - In the **Transformation** list, select **ExtractMailPrefix()**.
     - In the **Parameter 1** list, select **user.userprinicipalname**.
14. In the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** pane, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, select **Download** next to **Federation Metadata XML**.
15. Select a download option based on your requirements. Save the certificate on your computer.
16. In the **Set up SAP Fiori** section, copy the following URLs based on your requirements:

     - Login URL
     - Microsoft Entra Identifier
     - Logout URL

### Configure SAP Fiori single sign-on

1. Sign in to the SAP system and go to transaction code SAML2. A new browser window opens with the SAML configuration page.
2. To configure endpoints for a trusted identity provider (Microsoft Entra ID), select the **Trusted Providers** tab.
3. Select **Add**, and then select **Upload Metadata File** from the context menu.
4. Upload the metadata file that you downloaded in the Azure portal.
5. On the next page, in the **Alias** box, enter an arbitrary alias name.
6. Make sure that the value in the **Digest Algorithm** box is **SHA-256**.
7. Under **Single Sign-On Endpoints**, select **HTTP POST**.
8. Under **Single Logout Endpoints**, select **HTTP Redirect**.
9. Accept the default settings of **Artifact Endpoints** and **Authentication Requirements**.
10. Select **Trusted Provider** / **Identity Federation and Unspecified Supported NameID Formats**.
11. The values for **User ID Source** and **User ID Mapping Mode** determine the link between the SAP user and the Microsoft Entra claim. There are two supported scenarios:

     - Scenario 1: SAP user to Microsoft Entra user mapping
     - Scenario 2: Select the SAP user ID based on the configured email address in SU01. In this case, the email ID should be configured in SU01 for each user who requires SSO.

### Assign Microsoft Entra users

1. In the Azure portal, select **Enterprise Applications**, select **All applications**, then select **SAP Fiori**.
2. In the applications list, select **SAP Fiori**.
3. To verify the outcome, after the identity provider Microsoft Entra ID is activated in SAP Fiori, try to access one of the following URLs to test single sign-on as an assigned user (you shouldn't be prompted for a username and password):

     - <https://sapurl/sap/bc/bsp/sap/it00/default.htm>
     - <https://sapurl/sap/bc/bsp/sap/it00/default.htm>
