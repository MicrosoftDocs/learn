Whether you’re delivering content and files or building global apps and APIs, Azure Front Door can help you deliver higher availability, lower latency, greater scale, and more secure experiences to your users wherever they are.

Azure Front Door is Microsoft’s modern cloud Content Delivery Network (CDN) that provides fast, reliable, and secure access. Your users and your applications’ static and dynamic web content across the globe are connected. Azure Front Door delivers your content using Microsoft’s global edge network with hundreds of global and local points of presence (PoPs) distributed around the world close to both your enterprise and consumer end users.

> [!NOTE]
> For web workloads, we highly recommend utilizing Azure DDoS Protection and a web application firewall to safeguard against emerging DDoS attacks. Another option is to employ Azure Front Door along with a web application firewall. Azure Front Door offers platform-level protection against network-level DDoS attacks.

Azure Front Door enables internet-facing applications to:

- Build and operate modern internet-first architectures that have dynamic, high-quality digital experiences with highly automated, secure, and reliable platforms.
- Accelerate and deliver your app and content globally at scale to your users wherever they are.
- Intelligently secure your digital estate against known and emerging threats with intelligent security that embraces a Zero Trust framework.

## Key benefits

Global delivery scale using Microsoft’s network

Scale out and improve performance of your applications and content using Microsoft’s global Cloud CDN and WAN.

- Use the extensive Microsoft global edge network with edge locations across cities worldwide, connected to Azure using a private enterprise-grade WAN to improve latency for apps.
- Accelerate application performance by using Front Door’s anycast network and split TCP connections.
- Terminate SSL offload at the edge and use integrated certificate management.
- Natively support end-to-end IPv6 connectivity and the HTTP/2 protocol.

## Deliver modern apps and architectures

Modernize your internet-first applications on Azure with Cloud Native experiences:

- Integrate with DevOps-friendly command line tools across SDKs of different languages, Bicep, Azure Resource Manager templates, CLI, and PowerShell.
- Define your own custom domain with flexible domain validation.
- Load balance and route traffic across origins and use intelligent health probe monitoring across apps or content hosted in Azure or anywhere.
- Integrate with other Azure services such as DNS, Web Apps, Storage, and many more for domain and origin management.
- Move your routing business logic to the edge with enhanced rules engine capabilities including regular expressions and server variables.
- Analyze built-in reports with an all-in-one dashboard for both Front Door and security patterns.
- Monitor your Front Door traffic in real time, and configure alerts that integrate with Azure Monitor.
- Log each Front Door request and failed health probes.

## Simple and cost-effective

- Unified static and dynamic delivery offered in a single tier to accelerate and scale your application through caching, SSL offload, and Layer 3-4 DDoS protection.
- Free, autorotation managed SSL certificates that save time and quickly secure apps and content.
- Simplified cost model that reduces billing complexity with fewer meters needed to plan for.
- Azure to Front Door integrated egress pricing that removes the separate egress charge from Azure regions to Azure Front Door.

## Intelligent secure internet perimeter

- Secure applications with built-in Layer 3-4 DDoS protection, seamlessly attached Web Application Firewall (WAF), and Azure DNS to protect your domains.
- Protect your applications against Layer 7 DDoS attacks using WAF.
- Protect your applications from malicious actors with Bot Manager rules based on Microsoft's Threat Intelligence.
- Privately connect to your backend behind Azure Front Door with Private Link and embrace a Zero Trust access model.
- Provide a centralized security experience for your application via Azure Policy and Azure Advisor that ensures consistent security features across apps.

## Comparison between Azure Front Door and Azure CDN services

Azure Front Door and Azure CDN are both Azure services that offer global content delivery with intelligent routing and caching capabilities at the application layer. Both services can be used to optimize and accelerate your applications by providing a globally distributed network of points of presence (POP) close to your users. Both services also offer various features to help you secure your applications from malicious attacks and to help you monitor your application's health and performance.
