title: Implement class inheritance
summary: Learn how to create a class hierarchy using base and derived classes and how to hide or override members of a derived class by using `new`, `virtual`, `abstract`, and `override` keywords.&nbsp;&nbsp;
abstract: |
  -   Describe the principles of class inheritance.

  -   Configure base and derived classes.

  -   Hide the members of a base class by using the `new` keyword.

  -   Override the members of a base class by using the `virtual`, `override`, and `abstract` keywords.

  -   Access the members of a base class from within a derived class.

  -   Implement a class hierarchy in a C# app by using base and derived classes.
prerequisites: |
  -   An installation of Visual Studio Code with the C# Dev Kit extension installed.

  -   The ability to develop basic object-oriented program in C# that implement classes with properties and methods.

  -   The ability to create interfaces that define a contract&nbsp;for the classes implemented by a basic&nbsp;object-oriented program written in C#.
