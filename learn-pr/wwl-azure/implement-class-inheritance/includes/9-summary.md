In this module, you learned about the concept of inheritance in object-oriented programming, specifically in C#. You implemented class hierarchies and inheritance to enable code reuse, extensibility, encapsulation, consistency, and polymorphism. You explored how a derived class can inherit and extend members of a base class.

The main takeaways from this module include the principals of inheritance and the approaches to extending base class functionality in derived classes. You learned about the role of access modifiers in determining the visibility of inherited members. The module also explained the use of keywords like `abstract`, `virtual`, and `sealed` in controlling how base class members are inherited or overridden. Additionally, you learned how to use the `new` keyword to hide base class members and the `override` keyword to modify or extend the behavior of a base class member. Finally, you learned how to use of the `base` keyword to access members of a base class from a derived class.
