Contoso will need to continue operating an on-premises environment even after migrating workloads to Azure. Consequently, having the ability to apply Azure policies to on-premises Windows Server workloads is proving to be important. In addition, administrators need be able to review on-premises Windows Server instances in the Azure console.

In this module, you learned about Azure Arc, including how to onboard on-premises Windows servers to Azure Arc, how to deploy Azure policies on Azure Arc-enabled resources, and how to use RBAC to restrict access to Log Analytics data.
