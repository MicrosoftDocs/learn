  - content: "When a single SID 3-tier SAP NetWeaver high availability AnyDB is deployed using a 3-tier SAP Azure Resource Manager template, IP addresses are created for Azure internal load balancers and for the network cards for all virtual machines. Which of the following statements about those IP addresses is true?"
    choices:
    - content: "The IP addresses are properly configured automatically, and don't need to be changed."
