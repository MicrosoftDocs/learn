  questions:
  - content: "Which of the following is correct about cloud tiering?"
    choices:
    - content: "Archives infrequently accessed files to free up space on the local file share."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Cloud tiering allows frequently accessed files to be cached on the local server. Infrequently accessed files are tiered, or archived, to the Azure file share according to the policy created."
    - content: "Prioritizes the sync order of file shares."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Cloud tiering doesn't prioritize the sync order of file shares."
    - content: "Sets the frequency at which the sync job runs."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Cloud tiering doesn't set the job frequency."
  - content: "A local manufacturing company runs dedicated software in their warehouse to keep track of stock. The software needs to run on machines in the warehouse, but the management team wants to access the output from the main office. The limited bandwidth available in the warehouse has caused problems in the past when they tried to use cloud-based solutions. What is the best way to sync these files with the cloud?"
    choices:
    - content: "Create an Azure Files share and directly mount shares on the machines in the warehouse."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Is there a more efficient answer?"
    - content: "Use a machine in the warehouse to host a file share, install Azure File Sync, and share a drive with the rest of the warehouse."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. This answer is best because the low bandwidth means Azure File Sync will handle the updating and syncing of files efficiently over the low-bandwidth network."
    - content: "Install Azure File Sync on every machine in the warehouse and head office."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Is there a more efficient answer?"
  - content: "Which of the following best describes the Azure File Sync agent?"
    choices:
    - content: "It's installed on a server to enable Azure File Sync replication between the local file share and an Azure file share."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The Azure File Sync agent is a downloadable package that enables a Windows Server file share to be synced with an Azure file share."
    - content: "It's installed on a server to set NTFS permissions on files and folders."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Azure File Sync doesn't configure file permissions."
    - content: "It's installed on an Azure file share to control on-premises file and folder replication traffic."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Azure File Sync isn't just an on-premises agent."
