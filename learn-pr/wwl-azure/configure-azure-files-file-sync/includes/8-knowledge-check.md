Your company maintains a large document repository. You're implementing Azure Files shares to provide a central location for the documents. Users at offices in different geographical regions need access to the latest versions of the documents. You're configuring Azure File Sync to keep the information up to date across multiple offices.

The limited bandwidth available in the warehouse has caused problems in the past when they tried to use cloud-based solutions.
