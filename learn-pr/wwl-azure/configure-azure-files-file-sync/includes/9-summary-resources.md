Azure Administrators are familiar with Azure Files and the Azure File Sync agent. They know how to implement fully managed file shares in the cloud by using industry standard protocols. They understand how to use Azure File Sync to cache Azure Files shares on an on-premises Windows Server or cloud virtual machine.

In this module, you learned when to use Azure Files and how the service compares to Azure Blob Storage. You also reviewed Azure Files features such as snapshots and soft delete. You learned how Azure File Sync can be used with on-premises data stores. You also were introduced to Azure Storage Explorer.

The main takeaways for this module are:

- Azure Files provides the SMB and NFS protocols, client libraries, and a REST interface that allows access from anywhere to stored files.

- Azure Files is ideal to lift and shift an application to the cloud that already uses the native file system APIs. Share data between the app and other applications running in Azure.

- Azure Files offers two industry-standard file system protocols for mounting Azure file shares: the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol and the Network File System (NFS) protocol.

- Azure Files offers two types of file shares: standard and premium. The premium tier stores data on modern solid-state drives (SSDs), while the standard tier uses hard disk drives (HDDs).

- File share snapshots capture a point-in-time, read-only copy of your data.

- Soft delete allows you to recover your file share when it's deleted by an application or other storage account user.

- Azure Storage Explorer is a standalone application that makes it easy to work with stored data on Windows, macOS, and Linux. 

- Azure File Sync enables you to cache file shares on an on-premises Windows Server or cloud virtual machine.
