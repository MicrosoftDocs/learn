The ISE is a graphical environment that provides a script editor, a debugger, an interactive console, and several auxiliary tools that help you discover and learn Windows PowerShell commands. This module provides a basic overview on how the ISE works. You will learn about more advanced ISE’s capabilities in the subsequent modules.

## Panes

The ISE offers two main panes: a **Script** pane (or script editor) and the **Console** pane. You can position these vertically, with one above the other or horizontally, side-by-side in a two-pane view. You can also maximize one pane and switch back and forth between them. By default, a **Command Add-on** pane also displays. It enables you to search for or browse available commands, as well as review and fill in parameters for a command that you select. There's also a floating **Command** window that provides the same functionality.

## Customizing the view

The ISE provides several ways to customize the view. You can change the active font size by using the slider in the window's lower-right area. The **Options** dialog box lets you customize font and color selection for many different Windows PowerShell text elements, such as keywords and string values. The ISE also supports creation of visual themes. A *theme* is a collection of font and color settings that you can apply as a group to customize the ISE's appearance. There are several built-in themes intended for designated use cases, such as giving presentations. The ISE also gives you the option to create custom themes.

Other ISE features include:

- A built-in, extensible snippets library that you can use to store commonly used commands.
- The ability to load add-ins created by Microsoft or by third parties that provide additional functionality.
- Integration with Windows PowerShell’s debugging capabilities.

> [!NOTE]
> The PowerShell ISE is no longer in active feature development. As a shipping component of Windows, it continues to be officially supported for security and high-priority servicing fixes. We currently have no plans to remove the ISE from Windows.
Windows PowerShell ISE won't work with PowerShell 6 and newer. For a similar experience, you can use Visual Studio Code (VS Code) with the PowerShell extension. You will learn more about it in the next unit of this module.
