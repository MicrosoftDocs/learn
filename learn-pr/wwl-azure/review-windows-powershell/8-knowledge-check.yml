  questions:
  - content: "You want to start PowerShell 7 from the command line. Which command will you run?"
    choices:
    - content: "powershell.exe"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. You'll run the pwsh.exe command to start PowerShell 7. In Windows PowerShell, the PowerShell executable is named `powershell.exe`.

  - content: "Why might you decide to use the ISE versus the console host?"
    choices:
    - content: "Supports richer editing capabilities and can display a wider range of fonts"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The ISE supports richer editing capabilities and can display a wider range of fonts. It's also compatible with double-byte character sets, making it compatible with a wider variety of written languages. However, if you're simply running a few commands, the console is sufficient."
    - content: "Essential for running even a few commands"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The ISE supports richer editing capabilities and can display a wider range of fonts. It's also compatible with double-byte character sets, making it compatible with a wider variety of written languages. However, if you're simply running a few commands, the console is sufficient."
    - content: "Both of the above"
      isCorrect: false
