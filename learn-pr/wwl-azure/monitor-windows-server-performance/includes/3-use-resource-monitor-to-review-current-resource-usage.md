Resource Monitor in Windows Server provides detailed information about a server's real-time performance. Resource Monitor monitors the use and performance of a central processing unit (CPU), disk, network, and memory resources in real time. This enables you to identify and resolve resource conflicts and bottlenecks.

## Use Resource Monitor to get a snapshot of server performance

In Resource Monitor, if you expand the monitored elements, you can identify which processes are using which resources. In addition, you can use Resource Monitor to track a process or processes by selecting their check boxes.

> [!TIP]
> When you select a process, it remains selected in every Resource Monitor pane, which provides the information that you require regarding that process at the top of the screen, no matter where you are in the interface.
