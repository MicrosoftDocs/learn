quiz:
  title: ""
  questions:
  - content: "Which functionality in Topology should be used to determine the path that is being taken from the VM to the external data source?"
    choices:
    - content: "Next Hop"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Next Hop informs you of the next host that the path will take from the VM to the external data source."
    - content: "VNet Configuration"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Configuration information about the VNet won't provide information about the next hop between the VM and the external data source."
    - content: "DNS Settings"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. DNS settings information won't provide information about the next hop between the VM and the external data source."
  - content: "What must be installed on on-premises computers in order to use Connection Monitor to diagnose latency between those computers and an Azure storage endpoint?"
    choices:
    - content: "Azure Network Adapter"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Azure Network Adapter provides a point-to-site VPN connection from a Windows Server computer to an Azure VNet. It does not provide any diagnostic information about latency to an Azure storage endpoint."
    - content: "SNMP Agent"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Connection Monitor doesn't rely on SNMP to gather network performance data. Instead, it uses the Log Analytics agent to collect network performance data from the on-premises computers and send it to a Log Analytics workspace for analysis."
    - content: "Log Analytics Agent"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Connection Monitor uses the Log Analytics Agent in managing connection tests between an on-premises computer an Azure storage endpoint."
  - content: "A Connection Monitor is created between an Azure Arc enabled server in an on-premises location and an Azure storage endpoint. No warning threshold is specified so Connection Monitor uses default values for its tests. Which of the following results triggers a warning result?"
    choices:
    - content: "Ten percent of results over 500 milliseconds"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The default warning threshold for Connection Monitor is 10 percent of result over 750 milliseconds."
    - content: "Five percent of results over 750 milliseconds"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The default warning threshold for Connection Monitor is 10 percent of result over 750 milliseconds."
    - content: "Ten percent of results over 750 milliseconds"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The default warning threshold for Connection Monitor is 10 percent of result over 750 milliseconds."
