Mobile Application Management (MAM) is a crucial aspect of mobile device management, and this module will give you an introduction. The module will cover several key considerations for implementing MAM, including its benefits, challenges, and use cases.

Intune Mobile Application Management (MAM) refers to the suite of Intune management features you can use to publish, push, configure, secure, monitor, and update mobile apps for your users. MAM protects an organization's data within an application by using Microsoft Intune app protection policies that help protect your company data and prevent data loss. Your employees use mobile devices for both personal and work tasks. While making sure your employees can be productive, you want to prevent data loss, intentional and unintentional. You'll also want to protect company data that is accessed from devices that aren't managed by you. You can use Intune app protection policies independent of any mobile-device management (MDM) solution. This independence helps you protect your company's data with or without enrolling devices in a device management solution. By implementing app-level policies, you can restrict access to company resources and keep data within the purview of your IT department.

By the end of this module, you'll have a comprehensive understanding of Mobile Application Management, including its benefits, challenges, and best practices. You'll be equipped with the knowledge and skills to effectively implement and manage MAM policies in Configuration Manager and Intune and secure your organization's mobile apps and data.
