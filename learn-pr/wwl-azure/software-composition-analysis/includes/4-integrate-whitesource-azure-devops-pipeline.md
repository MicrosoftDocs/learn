Visual Studio Code Marketplace is an important site for addressing Secure DevOps issues. You can integrate specialist security products into your Azure DevOps pipeline.

Having a full suite of extensions that allow a seamless integration into Azure Pipelines is invaluable.

## Mend

The Mend extension is available on the Azure DevOps Marketplace. Using Mend, you can integrate extensions with your CI/CD pipeline to address Secure DevOps security-related issues.

The Mend extension specifically addresses open-source security, quality, and license compliance concerns for a team consuming external packages.

Because most breaches target known vulnerabilities in standard components, robust tools are essential to securing complex open-source components.

## Continuously detect all open-source components in your software

Mend automatically detect all open-source components—including their transitive dependencies—every time you run a build.

It means you can generate a comprehensive inventory report within minutes based on the last build you ran.

It also gives complete visibility to your security, DevOps, and legal teams into your organization’s software development process.

## Receive alerts on open-source security vulnerabilities

Mend automatically generates an alert and provides targeted remediation guidance when a new security vulnerability is discovered.

It can include links to patches, fixes, relevant source files, even recommendations to change system configuration to prevent exploitation.

## Automatically enforce open-source security and license compliance policies

According to a company’s policies, Mend automatically approves, rejects, or triggers a manual approval process every time a new open-source component is added to a build.

Developers can set up policies based on parameters such as security-vulnerability severity, license type, or library age.

When a developer adds a problematic open-source component, the service will alert and fail the build.

For searching online repositories such as GitHub and Maven Central, Mend also offers an innovative browser extension.

Before choosing a new component, a developer can review its security vulnerabilities, quality, license issues, and whether it fits their company’s policies.
