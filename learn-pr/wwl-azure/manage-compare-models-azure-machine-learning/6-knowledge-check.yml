  questions:
  - content: "A data scientist wants to investigate for which subgroups the model has relatively more false predictions, which Responsible AI component should be added to the pipeline to create the Responsible AI dashboard?"
    choices:
    - content: "Explanations."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Explanations provide insights into which features influence the model's predictions."
    - content: "Counterfactuals."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Counterfactuals allow you to explore how changing the input influences the model's predictions."
    - content: "Error analysis."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Error analysis provides an overview of the number of false predictions for specific subgroups in your dataset."
  - content: "What should be the first component in a pipeline to create a Responsible AI Dashboard?"
    choices:
    - content: "`RAI Insights dashboard constructor`"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The dashboard constructor should be the first component in the pipeline."
    - content: "`Gather RAI Insights dashboard`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The gather insights component comes at the end of the pipeline."
    - content: "`Gather RAI Insights score card`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The gather insights component comes at the end of the pipeline."
  - content: "A data scientist has trained a model, and wants to quantify the influence of each feature on a specific prediction. What kind of feature importance should the data scientist examine?"
    choices:
    - content: "Aggregate feature importance."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The aggregate feature importance is used to quantify the influence of each feature on the complete test dataset."
    - content: "Global feature importance."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The global feature importance is used to quantify the influence of each feature on the complete test dataset."
    - content: "Individual feature importance."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The individual feature importance shows how each feature influences an individual prediction."
