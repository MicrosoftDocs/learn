In this module, you have learned about Azure Container Registry, a managed registry service for storing and managing container images and related artifacts. It is based on Docker Registry 2.0 and can be used with existing container development and deployment pipelines. Azure Container Registry offers various use cases, such as pulling images to orchestration systems like Kubernetes and Azure services like Azure Container Apps. Developers can also push images to a container registry as part of their container development workflow. Azure provides features like security and access controls, support for different image formats, and automated image builds using Azure Container Registry Tasks.
