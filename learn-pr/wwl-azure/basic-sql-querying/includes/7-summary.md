# Summary

This tutorial is designed to equip learners with the fundamental skills needed to query PostgreSQL databases effectively. You should now be able to:

Retrieve specific data from PostgreSQL tables using SELECT statements, including selecting all or specific columns and identifying distinct values.
Filter data effectively using the WHERE clause with various conditions, comparison operators, pattern matching (LIKE), and range filtering (BETWEEN).
Sort query results in ascending or descending order using ORDER BY.
Control the number of rows returned using LIMIT and OFFSET.
Combine data from multiple tables using INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, and FULL OUTER JOIN.
Perform aggregate calculations such as counting, summing, averaging, and finding maximum and minimum values.
Group and summarize data using GROUP BY and filter grouped results with HAVING.
Write subqueries to retrieve data based on the results of other queries.
Apply these skills to real-world scenarios using the provided "Sales" database as a practical example.
Write basic to intermediate level PostgreSQL queries to extract meaningful insights from data.
