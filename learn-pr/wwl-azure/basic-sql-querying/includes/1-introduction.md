# Introduction

<!-- 1. Topic sentences ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Goal: Orient the learner to the area covered in this module.

    Heading: None

    Example: "Good cybersecurity relies on many factors to provide confidence and assurance that your data
             is safe and being used as expected."

    Recommended: Add a visual like an image, table, or list that supports the topic sentences.

Learning to query SQL data properly is essential for anyone working with databases. It enables you to quickly access specific information, generate reports, and identify data discrepancies, leading to improved efficiency and data integrity. Moreover, proficiency in DQL opens doors to numerous career opportunities in fields like data analysis and database administration. The motivation to learn stems from the desire to empower yourself with data-driven skills, solve complex problems, and continuously grow in the ever-evolving landscape of data management. This tutorial, using a practical sales database, provides a structured approach to mastering the core concepts of PostgreSQL DQL.

<!-- 2. Motivation ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Goal: Explain why the concepts that the module covers are important and how they're used. Consider
          posing a question or describing a challenging situation.

    Heading: None

    Example: "In the early years of computing systems, every application stored data in its own unique
             structure. When developers wanted to build applications to use that data, they had to know
             a lot about the data structure to find the data they needed. These structures were
             inefficient, hard to maintain, and hard to optimize for good application performance. The
             relational database model was designed to solve the problem of multiple arbitrary data
             structures. The relational model provides a standard way of representing and querying
             data that can be used by any application."

<!-- 4. Prose table of contents --------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Goal: List the activities that the learner does in this module. The prose table of contents differs
          from the title and the learning objectives. The title and the learning objectives are outcome-
          focused. They describe the skills the learner acquires as a result of consuming this content.
          In contrast, the prose table of contents states specifically what the learner **does** in order
          to acquire those skills. The format can be either prose or a bulleted list. But a list yields
          better results when transformed into other output types such as PowerPoint.

    Heading: "## What will we be doing?"

    Example: "In this module, we'll formally define several cybersecurity concepts like authentication
             and authorization. Then we'll put the concepts into context by describing some common
             authentication-based attacks. We'll also define some effective authorization security techniques."
 -->
## What will we be doing?

This tutorial takes a hands-on approach, using the Sales database to illustrate key DQL concepts. We'll start with basic SELECT statements and gradually progress to more complex queries involving joins, aggregations, and subqueries.

<!-- 5. Terminal learning objective ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Goal: Restate the module title as a complete sentence. You have more room here to convey the main goal
          than in a space-limited title. Make it outcome-focused so it describes the main skills and
          knowledge the learner acquires as a result of the training. Answer the question "What is the
          foundational knowledge the user gains as a result of consuming this training?"

    Heading: "## What is the main goal?"

    Example: "By the end of the module, you'll have a comprehensive understanding of core cybersecurity concepts."
 -->
## What is the main goal?

By the end of this tutorial, you'll have a solid understanding of how to retrieve and manipulate data using PostgreSQL DQL.
