The Semantic Kernel SDK allows developers to integrate results from Large Language Models (LLMs) through natural language prompts and custom function plugins. While you can manually invoke functions and prompts, the SDK also supports automated task planning. A planner is a dynamic tool within the SDK that uses artificial intelligence (AI) to automatically coordinate which plugins and functions to invoke based on the user's request. This feature can help you build adaptive applications that respond intelligently to dynamic user input.

Suppose you want to create an AI disc jockey that can tailor a user's music listening experience. You can use native functions to interact with a music library, add songs to a user's "Recently Played" list, and recommend songs and concerts. Using planners, you can streamline the execution of complex tasks, such as recommending an upcoming concert, or suggesting a song the user might like. Planners help provide dynamic functionality, allowing you to quickly adapt to the user's ever-changing needs.

In this module, you learn about the different ways you can automatically invoke functions using the Semantic Kernel SDK. You can understand how planners can generate plans to accomplish tasks. You also learn how to fine-tune planners to optimize performance.
