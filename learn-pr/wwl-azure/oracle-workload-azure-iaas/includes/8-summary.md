In this module, you took on the role of an administrator responsible for recommending an approach to move an Oracle-based application from an on-premises datacenter to the cloud, by using Azure VMs. You learned how Azure VMs can support Oracle databases and the planning and preparation required to perform during a migration. You then explored the process of deploying VMs to support your database and applications, along with the data migration tools to help you complete the process. Finally, you learned about how to improve management and optimize costs for long-term success.

You should now be able to:

- Describe how to move Oracle-powered applications to the cloud, by using Azure VMs.
- Explain the basics for planning these types of migrations.
- Describe the process for migrating Oracle databases and applications to your VMs.
