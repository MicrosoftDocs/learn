Every system, architecture, and application needs to be designed with security in mind, whether on-premises or in the cloud. There's too much at risk. For example, a denial of service attack could prevent your customer from reaching your web site or services and block you from doing business. Or, your website could be defaced, causing damage to your reputation. A data breach could be even worse, as it can ruin hard-earned trust, while causing significant personal and financial harm. We must all work to guarantee the security of our systems.

> ### Contoso Shipping Case Study
>
> You are working for Contoso Shipping, leading the development program of drone deliveries in rural areas, all while having truck drivers leverage mobile apps to deliver to urban areas. You're in the process of moving a large quantity of Contoso Shipping's infrastructure to the cloud in order to maximize efficiency. You are also moving several physical servers in the company's data center to Azure virtual machines. Your team plans on creating a hybrid solution, with some of the servers remaining on-premises. To do this, you'll need a secure, high-quality connection between the new virtual machines and the existing network.

In this module, you will explore the available network security capabilities in Azure and review how they help you build secure solutions in the cloud, based on your business needs.  We will use the Contoso Shipping example to show real-world examples.

By the end of this module, you will be able to discuss the basic concepts for protecting your infrastructure and data when you work in the cloud. You will also, understand the responsibilities that are yours and what Azure takes care of for you.
