Tailwind Traders has several workloads that are being migrated to Azure. You're reviewing all application database requirements to recommend the appropriate solution. Your design has to accommodate the following scenarios:

- **Inventory application**. You plan to migrate the inventory application with a database to the cloud, but you use a non-Microsoft application that requires Windows authentication. You also need full control and customization, including OS access.

- **HR application**. You need to migrate the HR application and database to the cloud, and remove some of the management associated with SQL Server. However, your application uses CLR and Service Broker capabilities from SQL Server. 

- **Database migration**. There are a few large on-premises SQL server databases that need to be migrated to the cloud. These databases contain anywhere from 40 TB to 80 TB of data.
