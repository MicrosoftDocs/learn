In this module, you learned how to design a cost efficient database solution that provides low latency, high availability, and scalability. You examined options for moving relational data workloads to the cloud. You explored scenarios for using Azure SQL Database, Azure SQL Managed Instance, and SQL Server on Azure Virtual Machines. You reviewed how to work with data in Azure SQL Edge, Azure Cosmos DB, and Azure Table Storage. You discovered how to protect data at rest, data in transmission, and data in use by using different security and encryption methods.
