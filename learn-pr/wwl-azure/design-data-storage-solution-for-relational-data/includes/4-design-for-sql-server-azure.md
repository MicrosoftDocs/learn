SQL Server on Azure Virtual Machines is a version of SQL Server that runs on an Azure virtual machine (VM). This service lets you use full versions of SQL Server in the cloud without having to manage your on-premises machines. Azure VMs come in many sizes and can be run in diverse geographic regions. Each SQL Server VM can be created to meet specific version and operating system requirements, which make them a good option for handling different SQL Server workloads.

### Things to know about SQL Server on Azure Virtual Machines

Review the following characteristics of the SQL Server on Azure Virtual Machines deployment option:

- When you run SQL Server on Azure Virtual Machines, you have access to the full capabilities of SQL Server.

- All of your SQL Server skills should directly transfer during the migration, and Azure can help automate backups and security patches.

- Unlike the Azure SQL Database and Azure SQL Managed Instance deployment options, you're responsible for version update operations for the OS and SQL Server.

#### Business scenario

Let's explore a business scenario for SQL Server on Azure Virtual Machines. AllScripts is a leading manufacturer of healthcare software. The company serves physician practices, hospitals, health plans, and the pharmaceutical industry. To transform its applications frequently, and host them securely and reliably, AllScripts wants to quickly move its data to Azure. In just three weeks, the company used Azure Site Recovery to migrate dozens of acquired applications running on approximately 1,000 VMs to Azure.
