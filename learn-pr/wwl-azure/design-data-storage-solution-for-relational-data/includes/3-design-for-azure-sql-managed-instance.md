Azure SQL Managed Instance is a PaaS deployment option of Azure SQL. As with Azure SQL Database, Azure SQL Managed Instance is a fully managed service. It provides an instance of SQL Server, but removes much of the overhead of managing a virtual machine. You can deploy a single managed instance or a managed instance pool.

### Things to know about Azure SQL Managed Instance

Review the following characteristics of the SQL Managed Instance deployment option.

- You can use SQL Managed Instance to do lift-and-shift migrations to Azure without having to redesign your applications.

- Azure SQL Managed Instance is ideal for customers interested in instance-scoped features, such as SQL Server Agent, Common language runtime (CLR), Database Mail, Distributed transactions, and Machine Learning Services.

- SQL Managed Instance uses vCores mode. You can define the maximum CPU cores and maximum storage allocated to your managed instance. All databases within the managed instance share the resources allocated to the instance.

- Most of the features available in SQL Server are available in SQL Managed Instance. Review this [comparison of SQL Database and SQL Managed Instance](/azure/azure-sql/database/features-comparison).

#### Business scenario

Let's explore a business scenario for Azure SQL Managed Instance. Komatsu is a manufacturing company that produces and sells heavy equipment for construction.
