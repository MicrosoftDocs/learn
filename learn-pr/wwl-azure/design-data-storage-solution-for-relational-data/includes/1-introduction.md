Many organizations have an aging or under-engineered data platform strategy. There's a significant trend of moving existing systems to the cloud, building new AI-ready applications quickly with the cloud, and offloading some on-premises costs. Organizations are seeking to design a plan for how to move their data workloads to the cloud. Administrators want to understand how to set up their organizations for success.
