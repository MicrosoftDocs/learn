  questions:
  - content: "You've trained a model using the Python SDK for Azure Machine Learning. You want to deploy the model to get real-time predictions. You want to manage the underlying infrastructure used by the endpoint. What kind of endpoint should you create?"
    choices:
    - content: "A managed online endpoint."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Azure Machine Learning manages all the infrastructure if you use a managed online endpoint."
    - content: "A batch endpoint."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A batch endpoint doesn't provide real-time predictions."
    - content: "A Kubernetes online endpoint."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. You should use Kubernetes online endpoint if you want to manage the underlying Kubernetes clusters."
  - content: "You're deploying a model as a real-time inferencing service. What functions must the scoring script for the deployment include?"
    choices:
    - content: "`main()` and `score()`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. You must implement init and run functions in the entry (scoring) script."
    - content: "`base()` and `train()`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. You must implement init and run functions in the entry (scoring) script."
    - content: "`init()` and `run()`"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. You must implement init and run functions in the entry (scoring) script."
