In this exercise, you'll configure a comprehensive pull request workflow for enterprise environments. You'll work through each step to establish advanced branch policies, automated governance controls, and scalable collaboration patterns using Azure Repos.

## Scenario: Enterprise Development Team Setup

You're the lead DevOps engineer for a financial services company implementing a new trading platform. The development involves multiple teams with varying responsibilities:

- **Core Development Team**: Primary application development and feature implementation.
- **Security Team**: Security review and compliance validation.
- **Architecture Team**: Architectural consistency and technical debt management.
- **QA Team**: Quality assurance and testing coordination.

Your mission is to establish a pull request workflow that ensures security compliance, maintains architectural integrity, and supports rapid development velocity while providing comprehensive audit trails required for financial industry regulations.

## Exercise Steps

### Step 1: Access Branch Policies Configuration

1. Navigate to your Azure DevOps project and access the **Repos** section.

2. Select your target repository and open the **Branches** view.

3. Locate the main branch (or your primary integration branch) and select **Branch policies** from the context menu:

### Step 2: Configure Reviewer Requirements

Configure **Minimum number of reviewers** with enterprise considerations:

:::image type="content" source="../media/require-minimum-number-reviewers-4e4d2d64.png" alt-text="Configure minimum reviewer requirements.":::

Apply these **Strategic Configuration** settings:

- Set minimum reviewers to 2 for comprehensive coverage.
- **Disable** "Allow requestors to approve their own changes" for separation of duties.
- **Enable** "Allow completion even if some reviewers vote to wait or reject" for emergency scenarios.
- **Configure** "When new changes are pushed" to reset all approval votes for security.

### Step 3: Set Up Automatic Reviewer Assignment

Implement intelligent reviewer routing based on expertise and code areas:

:::image type="content" source="../media/add-automatic-reviewers-528e31d0.png" alt-text="Configure automatic reviewer assignment.":::

Configure your **Enterprise Reviewer Strategy**:

- **Security Team**: Automatic assignment for authentication, authorization, and data handling changes.
- **Architecture Team**: Required for infrastructure, framework, and design pattern modifications.
- **Domain Experts**: Automatic assignment based on file paths and functional areas.
- **Cross-Training**: Include junior developers for knowledge transfer opportunities.

### Step 4: Enable Quality Assurance Policies

Establish comprehensive quality gates through comment resolution requirements:

:::image type="content" source="../media/check-comment-resolution-f4bb058c.png" alt-text="Enforce comment resolution requirements.":::

This policy ensures that all review feedback is addressed, creating accountability and preventing oversight gaps that could impact production stability.

### Step 5: Configure Traceability and Compliance

Configure work item linking for regulatory compliance and project tracking:

:::image type="content" source="../media/check-linked-work-items-9f9a5589.png" alt-text="Require work item linkage for traceability.":::

This provides these **Compliance Benefits**:

- Full audit trail from requirement to deployment.
- Regulatory compliance documentation.
- Impact analysis and change tracking.
- Project management integration and progress visibility.

### Step 6: Create Feature Branches with Traceability

Create feature branches directly from work items to establish automatic linkage:

:::image type="content" source="../media/create-branch-8f64a7d3.png" alt-text="Create branches from work items for automatic traceability.":::

Follow this **Enterprise Branch Naming Strategy**:

- Use folder prefixes for organization: `feature/`, `hotfix/`, `release/`.
- Include work item IDs for traceability: `feature/12345-trading-algorithm`.
- Consistent naming supports automation and analytics.

### Step 7: Implement Changes Using Best Practices

Implement changes using enterprise development practices:

:::image type="content" source="../media/change-code-commit-84502261.png" alt-text="Implement changes with comprehensive commit practices.":::

Follow these **Enterprise Commit Standards**:

- Descriptive commit messages linking to requirements.
- Atomic commits that represent logical changes.
- Security-conscious coding practices.
- Documentation updates accompanying code changes.

### Step 8: Create Comprehensive Pull Requests

Create pull requests that facilitate comprehensive review and collaboration:

:::image type="content" source="../media/create-pull-request-af53d7fb.png" alt-text="Create comprehensive pull requests with rich context.":::

Apply these **Enterprise Pull Request Best Practices**:

- **Comprehensive Descriptions**: Include business context, technical approach, and testing strategy.
- **Markdown Documentation**: Use structured markdown for clarity and readability.
- **Stakeholder Mentions**: @mention relevant team members and domain experts.
- **Work Item Integration**: Link related work items for complete context.

### Step 9: Coordinate Multi-Stakeholder Reviews

Coordinate sophisticated review processes across multiple stakeholders:

:::image type="content" source="../media/pull-request-comments-438950c3.png" alt-text="Manage comprehensive review discussions.":::

Implement this **Multi-Stakeholder Review Strategy**:

- **Security Reviews**: Focus on authentication, authorization, and data protection.
- **Architecture Reviews**: Evaluate design patterns, technical debt, and scalability.
- **Code Quality Reviews**: Assess maintainability, performance, and testing.
- **Documentation Reviews**: Ensure comprehensive documentation and knowledge transfer.

### Step 10: Facilitate Effective Review Discussions

Facilitate thorough review discussions that enhance code quality and knowledge transfer using these **Review Facilitation Techniques**:

- **Structured Feedback**: Categorize comments by type (critical, suggestion, question).
- **Educational Focus**: Explain reasoning behind suggestions for knowledge transfer.
- **Solution-Oriented**: Provide specific recommendations rather than just identifying issues.
- **Timeline Management**: Balance thoroughness with development velocity.

### Step 11: Leverage Azure DevOps Integration

Leverage Azure DevOps integration for comprehensive validation with these **Pipeline Integration Benefits**:

- **Automated Build Validation**: Ensure changes don't break compilation or basic functionality.
- **Test Suite Execution**: Run comprehensive test suites before allowing merge.
- **Security Scanning**: Integrate automated security analysis tools.
- **Performance Testing**: Validate performance impact of changes.

## Advanced Features and Management

### Branch Recovery and Management

Azure DevOps provides sophisticated branch management capabilities for enterprise environments:

**Deleted Branch Recovery**:

- Search for deleted branches by exact name.
- View deletion history and responsible parties.
- Restore branches while maintaining commit history.
- Re-establish policies and permissions as needed.

**Enterprise Branch Management**:

- Implement consistent branch naming conventions.
- Use folder organization for complex repository structures.
- Establish retention policies for completed work.
- Monitor branch proliferation and cleanup inactive branches.

## Measuring Success and Optimization

### Key Performance Indicators

Track the effectiveness of your pull request implementation:

**Velocity Metrics**:

- Pull request cycle time from creation to merge.
- Review participation rates and feedback quality.
- Policy compliance rates and exception handling.

**Quality Metrics**:

- Defect detection rates during review.
- Post-merge issue rates and root cause analysis.
- Knowledge transfer effectiveness and skill development.

**Compliance Metrics**:

- Audit trail completeness and accuracy.
- Regulatory compliance adherence.
- Security review coverage and effectiveness.

### Continuous Improvement

**Regular Assessment**:

- Conduct monthly retrospectives on pull request effectiveness.
- Gather team feedback on policy burden versus benefit.
- Analyze metrics to identify optimization opportunities.
- Evolve policies based on organizational maturity and changing requirements.
