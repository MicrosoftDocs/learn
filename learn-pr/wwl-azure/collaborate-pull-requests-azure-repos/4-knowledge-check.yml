  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
    - content: "In an enterprise environment with strict compliance requirements, which combination of branch policies would best ensure comprehensive governance while maintaining development velocity?"
      choices:
        - content: "Minimum reviewers (2), automatic reviewer assignment, comment resolution enforcement, work item linkage, and build validation with security scanning integration."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct. This combination provides comprehensive governance covering quality, compliance, security, and traceability without creating unnecessary bottlenecks in the development process."
        - content: "Minimum reviewers (5), manual reviewer assignment only, optional comment resolution, and basic build validation."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. While this provides review coverage, requiring 5 reviewers creates unnecessary bottlenecks, and optional comment resolution compromises governance requirements."
        - content: "Automatic merging after build success, minimal reviewer requirements, and basic policy enforcement."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. This approach lacks the comprehensive governance controls required for enterprise compliance and security requirements."
    - content: "When implementing pull request workflows for distributed teams across multiple time zones, which strategy best balances collaboration effectiveness with development velocity?"
      choices:
        - content: "Configure automatic reviewer assignment based on code areas and expertise, implement asynchronous review processes with clear SLAs, and establish escalation paths for critical changes."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct. This approach optimizes reviewer expertise utilization while accommodating distributed team collaboration and maintaining clear processes for urgent situations."
        - content: "Require all team members to review every pull request regardless of expertise area."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. This creates review bottlenecks and doesn't optimize expertise utilization across distributed teams."
        - content: "Limit pull request creation to specific time windows when all team members are available."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. This significantly constrains development velocity and doesn't leverage the benefits of distributed development."
    - content: "For a financial services organization requiring comprehensive audit trails and regulatory compliance, which pull request integration strategy provides the most comprehensive governance framework?"
      choices:
        - content: "Integrate pull requests with work item tracking for requirement traceability, implement automated security and compliance scanning, enforce comment resolution, and maintain comprehensive approval audit logs."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct. This comprehensive approach provides full traceability from requirements through deployment, automated compliance validation, and complete audit capabilities required for financial industry regulations."
        - content: "Basic pull request approval with manual documentation of compliance requirements."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. Manual processes don't provide the systematic compliance framework and comprehensive audit trails required for financial industry regulations."
        - content: "Automated merging based on successful builds with post-merge compliance documentation."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. Post-merge compliance validation doesn't provide the preventive controls and comprehensive governance required for financial services compliance."
