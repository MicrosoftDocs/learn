The underlying network components in your on-premises infrastructure are critical to connectivity to both on-premises server resources, and to those you host in Azure. In this module, you learned that Itâ€™s vital that you can troubleshoot on-premises connectivity and hybrid network connectivity. You learned to identify and resolve issues relating to DHCP and DNS, and basic IP configuration. You should now be able to diagnose IP addressing, name resolution, and routing problems in a hybrid environment.

Now that you have reviewed this module, you should be able to:

- Diagnose DHCP and DNS problems in on-premises contexts.

- Diagnose IP configuration and routing problems.

- Implement Packet Monitor to help diagnose network problems.

- Use Azure Network Watcher to troubleshoot Microsoft Azure virtual networks.
