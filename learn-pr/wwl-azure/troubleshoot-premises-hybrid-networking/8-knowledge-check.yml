  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "An administrator is investigating a problem with IP configurations. On Friday, all was working, and now, Monday morning, all the devices in only one subnet on the fourth floor of the HQ building can't connect to any corporate or internet resources. The administrator determines that the client computers have an IP address with the prefix 169.254.0.0/16. Which of the following is the likely cause of the problem?"
    choices:
    - content: "The router connecting the subnet to the rest of the network has failed."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Given the symptoms, this is the most likely cause."
    - content: "The administrator has failed to install a DHCP relay agent for this subnet."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Although a DHCP relay agent is required, the fact that things were working before suggests that any required components were in-place."
    - content: "The DHCP server for the building is offline."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This is unlikely as other devices in other subnets would also be affected."
  - content: "An administrator is working through a problem relating to name resolution. They want to use debug logging to try to locate the cause of the problem. Which of the following provides the correct next step?"
    choices:
    - content: "The administrator doesn't need to do anything. Debug logging is enabled by default. They merely need to review the logs."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Debug logging isn't disabled by default."
    - content: "The administrator must enable debug logging on the DNS server by selecting the Debug Logging tab and enabling and configuring the required options."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Debug logging is disabled by default, and must be enabled on the DNS server."
    - content: "The administrator must enable debug logging on the DNS zones that they want to verify. The administrator must select the Debug Logging tab for the zone and enabling and configuring the required options."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Debug logging isn't configured on DNS zones."
  - content: "A helpdesk consultant has responded a user support call. The user reports that they can't connect to a web server on the corporate network. The consultant determines that many users are experiencing the problem. They verify that the server hosting the website is online, but when they attempt to connect to the website, they receive an error: \"Hmmm can't reach this page\". What should they try next?"
    choices:
    - content: "The helpdesk consultant should use telnet to verify the server is listening on TCP port 443."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. This is a logical next step."
    - content: "The helpdesk consultant should verify the IP configuration of the user's computer."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Multiple users, including the helpdesk consultant, are unable to connect. It's therefore unlikely to be an IP configuration issue."
    - content: "The helpdesk consultant should ping the server by its IP address."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The consultant already determined the server is online."
