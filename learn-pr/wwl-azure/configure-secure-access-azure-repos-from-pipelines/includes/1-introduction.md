It's essential to have a secure environment where pipelines can access resources, such as packages, secrets, and services, without exposing sensitive information. In this module, you'll learn the best practices to ensure secure access to resources when working with Azure DevOps.

In this module, we cover the steps to configure secure access to packages and configure credential secrets and secrets for services in Azure DevOps. Finally, we cover how to use the service connection in a YAML pipeline to access packages securely.

### Learning objectives
