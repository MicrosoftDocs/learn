  title: "Quick review"
  questions:
  - content: "What's the purpose of the default network security group rules?"
    choices:
    - content: "These default rules exist so that an administrator doesn't need to create any rules of their own."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. These rules function as a baseline to ensure connectivity between your resources, and between your resources and the internet."
    - content: "These default rules allow some communication between Azure resources and also outbound communication to the internet."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. When you create a network security group, Azure creates several default rules. These default rules allow connectivity within a virtual network and from Azure load balancers. They also allow outbound communication to the internet, and deny inbound traffic from the internet"
    - content: "These rules are the only NSG rules that an administrator can create to help secure their Azure resources."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. When you create an NSG, Azure creates several default rules. These default rules can't be changed, but can be overridden with your own rules."
