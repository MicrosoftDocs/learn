In this module, you'll focus on how to improve the network security for Windows Server infrastructure as a service (IaaS) virtual machines (VMs) and how to diagnose network security issues with those VMs.

## Scenario

Contoso is a medium-size financial services company in London with a branch office in New York. Most of its compute environment runs on-premises on Windows Server. This includes virtualized workloads on Windows Server 2016 hosts. Contoso IT staff are in the process of migrating Contoso servers to Windows Server 2025.

Contosoâ€™s IT director realizes that Contoso has an outdated operational model with limited automation and reliance on dated technology. The Contoso IT Engineering team is exploring Azure capabilities. They want to determine whether Azure services might assist with modernizing the current operational model through automation and virtualization.

As part of the initial design, the Contoso IT team asked you, their lead system engineer and server administrator, to set up a proof of concept environment. This environment must verify whether Azure services can help to modernize the IT infrastructure and meet business goals.

In particular, the Contoso Information Security and Compliance team expressed concerns about possible risks introduced by migrating on-premises workloads to Azure.

In this module, you learn how to implement Network Security Groups (NSGs), adaptive network hardening, and Azure Firewall. You learn how to choose an appropriate network traffic filtering solution, and how to log traffic with Network Watcher.

## Learning objectives

After completing this module, you'll be able to:

- Implement NSGs with Windows Server IaaS VMs.
- Implement adaptive network hardening.
- Implement Azure Firewall.
- Implement Windows Defender Firewall in Windows Server IaaS VMs.
- Choose an appropriate filtering solution.
- Capture network traffic with Network Watcher.
