## Learning objectives

Azure Update Manager is a unified service that helps manage and govern updates for all your machines. This module covered how to monitor Windows and Linux update compliance across your deployments in Azure, on premises, and on other cloud platforms from a single dashboard. Update Manager makes real-time updates within a defined maintenance window.

The main takeaways from this module include:

 -  The enhanced functionality of Update Manager, which has been redesigned and no longer depends on Azure Automation or Azure Monitor Logs.
 -  Update Manager updates compliance for your entire fleet of machines and instant deployment of critical updates and flexible patching options.
 -  Update Manager's global availability in all Azure compute and Azure Arc regions for immediate installation of updates or scheduling for a later date.
 -  The use of Azure REST API to trigger an assessment and an update deployment on your Azure Arc enabled servers with Azure Update Manager.
