  - content: "A team member is trying to update a Microsoft Store Win32 app that was manually installed on their device. They're unsure if Intune will manage the update. What should they expect?"
    choices:
    - content: "Intune will uninstall the manually installed app before managing the update."

      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Intune can take over the management of a manually installed Microsoft Store Win32 app."
