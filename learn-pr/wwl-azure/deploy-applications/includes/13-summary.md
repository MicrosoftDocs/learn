This module explored the diverse approaches for deploying and updating organizational applications. Administrators need to understand the app lifecycle to manage apps using Intune effectively. Administrators can select from various deployment methods by specifying the required application prerequisites. Tools like Microsoft Intune or Microsoft Store can facilitate application delivery to devices. Configuration Manager and Group Policy can be used for devices in a domain. Finally, administrators can use the Intune Management Extension to deploy applications to non-domain-joined devices.
