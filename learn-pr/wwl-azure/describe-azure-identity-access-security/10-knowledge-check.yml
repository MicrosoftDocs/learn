  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "Which Azure Active Directory tool can vary the credentials needed to log in based on signals, such as where the user is located?"
    choices:
    - content: "Conditional Access"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Conditional Access is a tool that Azure Active Directory uses to allow (or deny) access to resources based on identity signals. Conditional Access might challenge you for a second authentication factor if your sign-in signals are unusual or from an unexpected location."
    - content: "Guest access"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Guest access is an access method that helps enable collaboration across organizational boundaries, but isn’t an authentication method or a tool to help with authentication."
    - content: "Passwordless"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Passwordless is an authentication method that relies on something you have; plus something you are or something you know. For example, Windows Hello is a passwordless authentication method."
  - content: "Which security model assumes the worst-case security scenario, and protects resources accordingly?"
    choices:
    - content: "Zero trust"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Zero Trust is a security model that assumes the worst case scenario and protects resources with that expectation."
    - content: "Defense-in-depth"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Defense-in-depth is focused on setting up a system that prevents access to information by unauthorized parties. It’s a proactive model and builds layer upon layer to protect information."
    - content: "Role-based access control"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Role-based access control provides the ability to grant or deny access based on a user or services assigned role."
  - content: "A user is simultaneously assigned multiple roles that use role-based access control. What are their actual permissions? The role permissions are: Role 1 - read || Role 2 - write || Role 3 - read and write."
    choices:
    - content: "Read only"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Role-based access control works on an allow model, so they wouldn’t be limited to the permissions of only one role."
    - content: "Write only"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Role-based access control works on an allow model, so they wouldn’t be limited to the permissions of only one role."
    - content: "Read and write"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Role-based access control, using an allow model, grants all of the permissions assigned in all of the assigned roles."
