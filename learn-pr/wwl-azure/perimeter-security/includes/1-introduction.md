Think of security in layers. You need to lock down the perimeter first, and then work your way inward locking down each layer. The more work and cost a bad-actor has to invest to get to valuable information the more likely they are to leave you alone.

## Scenario

A security engineer uses perimeter security features to block network traffic away from your primary network resources; you will work on such tasks as:

 -  Setup DDoS (denial-of-service) Protection.
 -  Configure and maintain firewalls.
 -  Use dedicated routes and network appliance to protect your network.

## Skills measured

Securing the Azure platform your cloud solutions run on is a part of [Exam AZ-500: Microsoft Azure Security Engineer](/learn/certifications/exams/az-500).
