Azure Architects understand how to design solutions to back up their data and support disaster recovery. These solutions help to avoid costly business interruptions due to component failures, malicious attacks, and outages. Microsoft Azure provides an end-to-end backup and disaster recovery solution that's secure, scalable, and resilient, while remaining cost-effective.

In this module, you learned how to select appropriate backup solutions for Azure workloads. You also reviewed how to select appropriate disaster recovery options for these workloads. You explored backup and recovery options for Azure files, blobs, virtual machines, and SQL databases. You examined how to design solutions for several Azure services, including Azure Backup and Azure Site Recovery.
