You've been asked to help secure information being transmitted between your companyâ€™s app and the customer. Azure App Service has tools that let you  create, upload, or import a private certificate or a public certificate into App Service.

A certificate uploaded into an app is stored in a deployment unit that is bound to the app service plan's resource group and region combination (internally called a *webspace*). This makes the certificate accessible to other apps in the same resource group and region combination.

The table below details the options you have for adding certificates in App Service:

| Option | Description |
|--|--|
| Create a free App Service managed certificate | A private certificate that's free of charge and easy to use if you just need to secure your custom domain in App Service. |
| Purchase an App Service certificate | A private certificate that's managed by Azure. It combines the simplicity of automated certificate management and the flexibility of renewal and export options. |
| Import a certificate from Key Vault | Useful if you use Azure Key Vault to manage your certificates. |
| Upload a private certificate | If you already have a private certificate from a third-party provider, you can upload it. |
| Upload a public certificate | Public certificates aren't used to secure custom domains, but you can load them into your code if you need them to access remote resources. |

## Private certificate requirements

The free **App Service managed certificate** and the **App Service certificate** already satisfy the requirements of App Service. If you want to use a private certificate in App Service, your certificate must meet the following requirements:

* Exported as a password-protected PFX file, encrypted using triple DES.
* Contains private key at least 2048 bits long
* Contains all intermediate certificates in the certificate chain

To secure a custom domain in a TLS binding, the certificate has other requirements:

* Contains an Extended Key Usage for server authentication (OID = 1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.1)
* Signed by a trusted certificate authority

## Creating a free managed certificate

To create custom TLS/SSL bindings or enable client certificates for your App Service app, your App Service plan must be in the **Basic**, **Standard**, **Premium**, or **Isolated** tier.

The free App Service managed certificate is a turn-key solution for securing your custom DNS name in App Service. It's a TLS/SSL server certificate that's fully managed by App Service and renewed continuously and automatically in six-month increments, 45 days before expiration. You create the certificate and bind it to a custom domain, and let App Service do the rest.

The free certificate comes with the following limitations:

* Doesn't support wildcard certificates.
* Doesn't support usage as a client certificate by using certificate thumbprint, which is planned for deprecation and removal.
* Doesn't support private DNS.
* Isn't exportable.
* Isn't supported in an App Service Environment (ASE).
* Only supports alphanumeric characters, dashes (-), and periods (.).


## Import an App Service Certificate

If you purchase an App Service Certificate from Azure, Azure manages the following tasks:

* Takes care of the purchase process from certificate provider.
* Performs domain verification of the certificate.
* Maintains the certificate in Azure Key Vault.
* Manages certificate renewal.
* Synchronize the certificate automatically with the imported copies in App Service apps.

If you already have a working App Service certificate, you can:

* Import the certificate into App Service.
* Manage the certificate, such as renew, rekey, and export it.

> [!NOTE]
> App Service Certificates are not supported in Azure National Clouds at this time.
