In this module, you learned about the Azure VPN gateway. The Azure VPN gateway enables secure, encrypted connections between an Azure virtual network and an on-premises network. You  also learned about the two types of VPN gateways: policy-based and route-based. Site-to-Site (S2S) and Point-to-Site (P2S) VPN gateways, their benefits, and potential limitations were described. Lastly, the module introduced Azure Virtual WAN, a networking service that provides various networking, security, and routing functionalities.

**The main takeaways from this module are:**

+ VPN gateway planning considers throughput, public IP address availability, VPN device compatibility, VPN gateway type, and Azure VPN Gateway SKU. 
+ Most VPN gateways are route-based. Route-based gateways use dynamic routing. 
+ There are several high availability options for VPN connections. The default option is active-standby but you can also configure active-active. 
+ A site-to-site VPN gateway uses IPsec tunnels to secure connections between virtual and physical networks. 
+ A point-to-point VPN gateway creates a secure connection to your virtual network from an individual client computer. Several authentication methods are available including Microsoft Entra ID and Active Directory Domain Services.
+ Network virtual appliances support connecting many different technologies. You can deploy partner solutions from the Microsoft Azure Marketplace.
