## Lab scenario

In this exercise, you configure a virtual network gateway to connect the Contoso Core Services VNet and the Manufacturing VNet.

## Architecture diagram

**Important**: Look closely at this design. Did you notice the CoreServicesSubnet overlaps with the GatewaySubnet? As a best practice, these subnets should be segregated to avoid potential connectivity issues.

## Objectives

 -  **Task 1**: Create CoreServicesVnet and ManufacturingVnet
    - Use a template to create the virtual networks. You can review the [lab template](https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/AZ-700-Designing-and-Implementing-Microsoft-Azure-Networking-Solutions/blob/master/Allfiles/Exercises/M02/azuredeploy.json).
    - Use Azure PowerShell to deploy the template. 
 -  **Task 2**: Create CoreServicesTestVM
    - Use a template to create the virtual machines. You can review the [lab template](https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/AZ-700-Designing-and-Implementing-Microsoft-Azure-Networking-Solutions/blob/master/Allfiles/Exercises/M02/CoreServicesVMazuredeploy.json).
    - Use Azure PowerShell to deploy the template. 
 -  **Task 3**: Create ManufacturingTestVM
    - Use a template to create the virtual machines. You can review the [lab template](https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/AZ-700-Designing-and-Implementing-Microsoft-Azure-Networking-Solutions/blob/master/Allfiles/Exercises/M02/ManufacturingVMazuredeploy.json).
    - Use Azure PowerShell to deploy the template. 
 -  **Task 4**: Connect to the Test VMs using RDP
 -  **Task 5**: Test the connection between the VMs
 -  **Task 6**: Create CoreServicesVnet Gateway
 -  **Task 7**: Create ManufacturingVnet Gateway
 -  **Task 8**: CoreServicesVnet to ManufacturingVnet
 -  **Task 9**: Connect ManufacturingVnet to CoreServicesVnet
 -  **Task 10**: Verify that the connections connect
 -  **Task 11**: Test the connection between the VMs
