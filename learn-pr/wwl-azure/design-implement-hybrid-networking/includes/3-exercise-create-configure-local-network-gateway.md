## Lab scenario

In this exercise, you configure a virtual network gateway to connect the Contoso Core Services VNet and the Manufacturing VNet.

## Architecture diagram

**Important**: Look closely at this design. Did you notice the CoreServicesSubnet overlaps with the GatewaySubnet? As a best practice, these subnets should be segregated to avoid potential connectivity issues.
