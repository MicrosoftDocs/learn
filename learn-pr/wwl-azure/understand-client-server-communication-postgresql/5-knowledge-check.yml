  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "What is the purpose of pgBouncer?"
    choices:
    - content: "When pgBouncer is enabled, it stops connections from being reused."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The pgBouncer extension is a PostgreSQL extension that enables connections to be reused."
    - content: "When pgBouncer is enabled, it ensures connections are reused."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The pgBouncer extension is a PostgreSQL extension that enables connection pooling. Connection pooling enables connections to be reused, rather than being created and destroyed."
    - content: "When pgBouncer is enabled, it prevents more users connecting than the server can handle."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The **max_connections** parameter is the server parameter that limits the number of connections that can be made to the server."
  - content: "For best performance on Azure Database for PostgreSQL, how should you manage connection handling?"
    choices:
    - content: "Process-based connection handling."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. PostgreSQL uses process-based connection handling by default. If you have many idle connections, this process is inefficient and expensive on resources."
    - content: "Connection pooling."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Connection pooling with pgBouncer can improve database performance."
    - content: "Set **max_connections** to the minimum possible value."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Setting max_connections to an appropriate value is part of connection handling, but doesn't improve performance."
  - content: "You want to benchmark the performance of your database after making some changes to server parameters. Which client tool is best suited to your needs?"
    choices:
    - content: "Azure Data Studio."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Azure Data Studio is a client tool designed to connect and develop queries for your PostgreSQL server. It isn't a specialist benchmark tool."
    - content: "the **pgbench** tool."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The pgbench tool is designed to run benchmark tests on PostgreSQL databases."
    - content: "the **psql** tool."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. There is no psql tool, psql is a command line utility that allows you to interact with a PostgreSQL server. It doesn't have any specialist benchmark testing capabilities."
