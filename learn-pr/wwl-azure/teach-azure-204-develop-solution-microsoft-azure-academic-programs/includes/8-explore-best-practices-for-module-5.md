AZ-204: Module 5 Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) 

Module 5 Overview 

As you begin to teach this module, get familiar with what the students will learn during the module. In this module students will learn how to migrate virtual machines to the Cloud and run them as Infrastructure as a Service (Iaas), create a Docker container image and deploy it to Azure Container Registry, deploy an Azure container instance, and how to move a group of on-premises servers into the Cloud and manage them collectively as an availability set. 

This module consists of four lessons: 

- Lesson 1 – Provision virtual machines in Azure 
- Lesson 2 – Create and deploy Azure Resource Manager templates 
- Lesson 3 – Manage container images in Azure Container Registry 
- Lesson 4 – Run container images in Azure Container Instances
