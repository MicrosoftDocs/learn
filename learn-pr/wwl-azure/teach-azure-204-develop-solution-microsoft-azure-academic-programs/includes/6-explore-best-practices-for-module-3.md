Module 3 Overview 

As you begin to teach this module, get familiar with what the students will learn during the module. In this module students will learn that Blobs are the modern tool and method to store unstructured information and how a storage account, which is a regionally based unit of replication, is a way to control replication at a regional level for a whole series of similarly managed objects. They will also learn that Blob storage is typically how data is stored in an Azure storage account.

This module consists of three lessons: 

- Lesson 1 – Explore Azure Blob storage  
- Lesson 2 – Manage the Azure Blob storage lifecycle
