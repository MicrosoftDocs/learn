Refactoring is supposed to change internal structure without changing external behavior. To be confident in this, we must test the code after refactoring.

### Benefits of testing after refactoring

- Catch regressions.
- Ensure correctness.
- Verify performance (if relevant).
- Confirm that behavior is unchanged.

## Testing Strategies

1. Rerun existing unit tests

    - If tests already exist for the function or its behavior, run them.  
    - They should pass exactly as before.

1. Write new tests for critical paths

    If no tests exist, add a few to cover:

    - Normal use cases.
    - Edge cases.
    - Error conditions.

1. Compare outputs or side effects

    Run the same inputs through both versions (old vs new) and compare:

    - Return values.
    - Console output.
    - Logs.
    - Database changes.

1. Use Copilot to generate tests

    - Follow your company guidelines for test projects and unit testing.
    - Construct a prompt to generate unit tests. For example: “Generate unit tests for the `ProcessOrder` method.”
    - Review and run the generated tests to validate functionality.

## Run the Application End-to-End

If the function is part of a larger app:

- Trigger the functionality manually.
- Confirm expected behavior in UI or API.
- Check logs, emails, database records, etc.

## Regression Checklist

After refactoring, verify the following haven’t changed:

- Outputs (return values, generated data).
- State changes (object fields, database records).
- Exceptions for error conditions.
- Performance (optional, if relevant).

## Quality Checks

Beyond correctness, do a quick quality pass:

- **Naming:** Are new function names clear and consistent?
- **Documentation:** Update or remove outdated comments.
- **Dead code removal:** Eliminate unused variables or parameters.
- **Consistency:** Ensure new functions fit the class/module design.

## When to Roll Back

If tests reveal serious issues:

- Revert to the original code.
- Attempt the refactoring again in smaller steps.
- Use version control to compare and recover.

## Final Thought

Refactoring isn’t complete until:

- All tests pass.
- Code is cleaner.
- Behavior is unchanged.

> **TIP:**
> Always run tests after each refactor step.  
> If something breaks, fix it immediately or roll back.  
> Copilot can help generate or fix tests, but you need to stay in control.

## Summary

Testing ensures your refactoring is safe and successful.  
It validates that your code still works and gives you confidence to move forward.  
With Copilot’s help, testing can be faster and more thorough.
