Refactoring large functions into smaller, more manageable functions is a fundamental skill for creating maintainable and testable code. GitHub Copilot can help you identify opportunities for refactoring and suggest ways to break down complex functions.

Imagine you're a software developer working on a legacy codebase with several large, monolithic functions that are difficult to understand and maintain. You need to refactor these functions to improve code quality, but you want to ensure that the refactoring process is efficient and doesn't introduce bugs. By using GitHub Copilot's code analysis and suggestion capabilities, you can systematically break down large functions into smaller, focused functions that follow the single responsibility principle.

In this module, you practice using GitHub Copilot to refactor large functions. You learn how to identify functions that need refactoring, decompose them into smaller units, and ensure that the refactored code maintains the same functionality.

The topics covered in this module include:

- Identifying large functions that need refactoring.
- Analyzing function complexity and dependencies with GitHub Copilot.
- Decomposing large functions into smaller, focused functions.
- Extracting reusable code into separate functions.
- Maintaining functionality while improving code structure.
- Testing refactored code to ensure correctness.

By the end of this module, you're able to:

- Identify large functions that would benefit from refactoring.
- Use GitHub Copilot to analyze function complexity and suggest refactoring opportunities.
- Break down large functions into smaller, more maintainable units.
- Extract common functionality into reusable functions.
- Ensure refactored code maintains original functionality through testing.
