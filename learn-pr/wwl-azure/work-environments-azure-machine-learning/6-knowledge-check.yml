  questions:
  - content: "A data scientist created a script that trains a machine learning model using the open-source library scikit-learn. The data scientist wants to quickly test whether the script can run on the existing compute cluster, what type of environment should the data scientist use?"
    choices:
    - content: "Default"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Default environments do not exist."
    - content: "Curated"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Curated environments are ideal to use for faster development time."
    - content: "Custom"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Creating a custom environment will take more time than using a curated environment."
  - content: "A command job fails with the error message that a module isn't found. The data scientist used a curated environment and wants to add a specific Python package to create a custom environment and successfully run the job. Which file should be created before creating the custom environment that uses a curated environment as reference?"
    choices:
    - content: "Training script"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Although you need to import any module you use in your script, including the packages in your script will not automatically install them on the compute target."
    - content: "Docker image"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Since a curated environment is used as reference, there is already a Docker image."
    - content: "Conda specification"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. You can list Python packages in a conda specification file."
