To implement infrastructure as code for your Azure solutions, use Azure Resource Manager templates. The template is a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) file that defines the infrastructure and configuration for your project. The template uses declarative syntax, which lets you state what you intend to deploy without having to write the sequence of programming commands to create it. In the template, you specify the resources to deploy and the properties for those resources.

You should now be able to:

 -  List the advantages of Azure templates.
 -  Identify the Azure template schema components.
 -  Specify Azure template parameters.
 -  Locate and use Azure QuickStart templates.
