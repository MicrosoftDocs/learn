The Azure Key Vault service supports two types of containers: vaults and managed hardware security module(HSM) pools. Vaults support storing software and HSM-backed keys, secrets, and certificates. Managed HSM pools only support HSM-backed keys.

Azure Key Vault helps solve the following problems:

* **Secrets Management:** Azure Key Vault can be used to Securely store and tightly control access to tokens, passwords, certificates, API keys, and other secrets

* **Key Management:** Azure Key Vault can also be used as a Key Management solution. Azure Key Vault makes it easy to create and control the encryption keys used to encrypt your data.

* **Certificate Management:** Azure Key Vault is also a service that lets you easily provision, manage, and deploy public and private Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security (SSL/TLS) certificates for use with Azure and your internal connected resources.


Azure Key Vault has two service tiers: Standard, which encrypts with a software key, and a Premium tier, which includes hardware security module(HSM)-protected keys. To see a comparison between the Standard and Premium tiers, see the [Azure Key Vault pricing page](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/key-vault/).

## Key benefits of using Azure Key Vault

* **Centralized application secrets:** Centralizing storage of application secrets in Azure Key Vault allows you to control their distribution. For example, instead of storing the connection string in the app's code you can store it securely in Key Vault. Your applications can securely access the information they need by using URIs. These URIs allow the applications to retrieve specific versions of a secret. 

* **Securely store secrets and keys:** Access to a key vault requires proper authentication and authorization before a caller (user or application) can get access. Authentication is done via Microsoft Entra ID. Authorization may be done via Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC) or Key Vault access policy. Azure RBAC can be used for both management of the vaults and to access data stored in a vault, while key vault access policy can only be used when attempting to access data stored in a vault. Azure Key Vaults may be either software-protected or, with the Azure Key Vault Premium tier, hardware-protected by hardware security modules (HSMs).

* **Monitor access and use:** You can monitor activity by enabling logging for your vaults. You have control over your logs and you may secure them by restricting access and you may also delete logs that you no longer need. Azure Key Vault can be configured to:

    * Archive to a storage account.
    * Stream to an event hub.
    * Send the logs to Azure Monitor logs.

* **Simplified administration of application secrets:** Security information must be secured, it must follow a life cycle, and it must be highly available. Azure Key Vault simplifies the process of meeting these requirements by:

    * Removing the need for in-house knowledge of Hardware Security Modules
    * Scaling up on short notice to meet your organizationâ€™s usage spikes.
    * Replicating the contents of your Key Vault within a region and to a secondary region. Data replication ensures high availability and takes away the need of any action from the administrator to trigger the failover.
    * Providing standard Azure administration options via the portal, Azure CLI and PowerShell.
    * Automating certain tasks on certificates that you purchase from Public CAs, such as enrollment and renewal.
