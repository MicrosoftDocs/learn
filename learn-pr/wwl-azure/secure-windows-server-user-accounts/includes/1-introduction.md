The first step in securing Windows Server is to ensure that you've properly configured user accounts. First, confirm the accounts have only the privileges needed to perform necessary tasks by using the principal of least privilege. Additionally, you need to protect user account credentials from compromise by restricting resources that accounts can use to authenticate against, and the protocols that can be used for that authentication
