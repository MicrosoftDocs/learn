      explanation: "That's incorrect. Front Door is not needed for non-internet facing applications."
    - content: "Azure Load balancer"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That is incorrect. While Azure Load Balancer may technically work, it isn't recommended for web applications. This is because of the lack of security and optimization features."
  - content: "Which security solution is recommended?"
    choices:
    - content: "Azure Firewall"
      isCorrect: true

  - content: "What network topology is recommended based on the architecture requirement?"
    choices:
    - content: "Virtual WAN network topology"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That’s correct. A Virtual WAN topology meets the requirements for deploying resources across several Azure regions and enables global connectivity between VNets in these Azure regions and multiple on-premises locations."
    - content: "Traditional network topology"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That’s incorrect. A traditional network topology can be used if your organization intends to deploy resources across several Azure regions. This doesn't provide the ability to centrally manage the networks and connections."
    - content: "Single Isolated Virtual Network"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That’s incorrect. A single isolated virtual network would not meet the needs of global connectivity"
