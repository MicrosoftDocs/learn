      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Azure Front Door isn't needed for non-internet facing applications."
    - content: "Azure Application Gateway"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Azure Application Gateway is the best choice for a web app that's not internet facing."
    - content: "Azure Load Balancer"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While Azure Load Balancer might technically work, it isn't recommended for web applications. Load Balancer doesn't offer the required security and optimization features."
  - content: "Which security solution is necessary to filter the traffic as indicated?"
    choices:
    - content: "Azure Web Application Firewall on Azure Application Gateway"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Azure Web Application Firewall on Application Gateway can't filter HTTP(S) traffic from Azure to on-premises and outbound to the internet"
    - content: "Azure Bastion"

      explanation: "Incorrect. Azure Bastion can be used to access virtual machine security, but not for filtering traffic."
    - content: "Azure Firewall"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Azure Firewall can filter HTTP(S) traffic from Azure to on-premises and outbound to the internet."
  - content: "What network topology is recommended based on the architecture requirement?"
    choices:
    - content: "Azure Virtual WAN network topology"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. A Virtual WAN topology meets the requirements for deploying resources across several Azure regions. It enables global connectivity between virtual networks in these Azure regions and multiple on-premises locations."
    - content: "Traditional network topology"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A traditional network topology can be used if your organization intends to deploy resources across several Azure regions. A traditional topology doesn't provide centralized management of the networks and connections."
    - content: "Single isolated virtual network"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A single isolated virtual network doesn't meet the needs of global connectivity."
