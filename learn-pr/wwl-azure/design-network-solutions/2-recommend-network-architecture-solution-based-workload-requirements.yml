quiz:
  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "What is a best practice for designing IP addressing for virtual networks?"
    choices:
    - content: "Assign an address space larger than a CIDR range of /16 for each virtual network."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The CIDR range shouldn't be larger to avoid unusable addresses."
    - content: "Overlap the virtual network address space with on-premises network ranges."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Overlapping network addresses can cause connectivity issues."
    - content: "Use a hub and spoke network topology to centralize common services."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Hub and spoke topologies isolates workloads while sharing services."
