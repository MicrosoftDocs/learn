This module is a guided project where you use Visual Studio Code to develop a proof-of-concept artificially intelligent DevOps assistant. The project demonstrates how the Semantic Kernel SDK can interface with a large language model (LLM) to process and retrieve information, and integrate native code to perform specialized tasks. In this project, you develop the functionality to assist users with their travel plans. Let's start by setting up your development environment!

## Project overview

In this project, you apply what you learned about the Semantic Kernel SDK. You're provided a project with some basic starter code that you edit in the Azure Cloud Shell. This project demonstrates how the Semantic Kernel SDK can be used to create artificially intelligent agents that can automate custom tasks. 

Launch the exercise and follow the instructions.
