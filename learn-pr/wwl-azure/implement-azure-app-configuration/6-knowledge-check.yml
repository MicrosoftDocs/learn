    choices:
    - content: "Labels are used to differentiate key-values with the same key in App Configuration."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Labels in Azure App Configuration are used to create variants of a key and differentiate key-values with the same key."
    - content: "Labels are used to encrypt key-values in App Configuration."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Labels do not provide encryption. They are used to differentiate key-values with the same key."
    - content: "Labels are used to limit the size of key-values in App Configuration."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Labels do not limit the size of key-values. They are used to differentiate key-values with the same key."
  - content: "What is the role of a feature manager in managing application features?"
    choices:
    - content: "A feature manager is a rule for evaluating the state of a feature flag."

    - content: "To permanently store the unwrapped encryption key"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The unwrapped encryption key is cached within App Configuration for one hour, not stored permanently."
    - content: "To encrypt sensitive information at rest"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Customer-managed keys are used to encrypt sensitive information in key-value pairs at rest."
