  questions:
  - content: "What is the purpose of labels in Azure App Configuration?"
    choices:
    - content: "Labels are used to differentiate key-values with the same key in App Configuration."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Labels in Azure App Configuration are used to create variants of a key and differentiate key-values with the same key."
    - content: "Labels are used to encrypt key-values in App Configuration."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Labels do not provide encryption. They are used to differentiate key-values with the same key."
    - content: "Labels are used to limit the size of key-values in App Configuration."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Labels do not limit the size of key-values. They are used to differentiate key-values with the same key."
  - content: "What is the role of a feature manager in managing application features?"
    choices:
    - content: "A feature manager is a rule for evaluating the state of a feature flag."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This answer is the definition of a filter, not a feature manager."
    - content: "A feature manager is a variable with a binary state of on or off."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This answer is the definition of a feature flag, not a feature manager."
    - content: "A feature manager is an application package that handles the lifecycle of all the feature flags in an application."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. A feature manager provides extra functionality, such as caching feature flags and updating their states."
  - content: "What is the purpose of using customer-managed keys in Azure App Configuration?"
    choices:
    - content: "To enable authentication with Microsoft Entra ID"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While a managed identity is used for authentication, it's not the primary purpose of customer-managed keys."
    - content: "To permanently store the unwrapped encryption key"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The unwrapped encryption key is cached within App Configuration for one hour, not stored permanently."
    - content: "To encrypt sensitive information at rest"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Customer-managed keys are used to encrypt sensitive information in key-value pairs at rest."
