  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "What is the purpose of labels in Azure App Configuration?"
    choices:
    - content: "Labels are used to differentiate key-values with the same key in App Configuration."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Labels in Azure App Configuration are used to create variants of a key and differentiate key-values with the same key."
    - content: "Labels are used to encrypt key-values in App Configuration."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Labels don't provide encryption. They're used to differentiate key-values with the same key."
    - content: "Labels are used to limit the size of key-values in App Configuration."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Labels don't limit the size of key-values. They're used to differentiate key-values with the same key."
  - content: "What is the role of a feature manager in managing application features?"
    choices:
    - content: "A feature manager is a rule for evaluating the state of a feature flag."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This answer is the definition of a filter, not a feature manager."
    - content: "A feature manager is a variable with a binary state of on or off."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This answer is the definition of a feature flag, not a feature manager."
    - content: "A feature manager is an application package that handles the lifecycle of all the feature flags in an application."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. A feature manager provides extra functionality, such as caching feature flags and updating their states."
  - content: "In a Key Vault access policy, which key permissions must you grant to the Azure App Configuration managed identity to enable customer-managed keys?"
    choices:
    - content: "GET, WRAP, and UNWRAP permissions on the Key Vault key"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. App Configuration uses its managed identity to access the Key Vault key and wrap/unwrap the store’s encryption key."
    - content: "GET and LIST permissions on Key Vault secrets"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Customer-managed keys use a Key Vault key (not secrets) and require wrap/unwrap operations."
    - content: "CREATE and DELETE permissions on the Key Vault key"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. App Configuration doesn’t need to create or delete the key; it needs to wrap and unwrap with an existing key."
