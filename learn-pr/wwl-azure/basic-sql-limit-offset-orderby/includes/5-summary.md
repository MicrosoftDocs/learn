This tutorial provides essential skills for controlling result sets in PostgreSQL using the LIMIT and OFFSET clauses. 
You should now be able to retrieve a set number of rows, implement pagination by combining OFFSET with LIMIT, and ensure consistent output using ORDER BY. 
These techniques will help you efficiently manage and navigate large datasets in real-world PostgreSQL scenarios.
