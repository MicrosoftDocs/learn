## Summary

This tutorial is designed to equip learners with the essential skills for controlling result sets in PostgreSQL using the LIMIT and OFFSET clauses. You should now be able to:

Retrieve a specific number of rows from a query using the LIMIT clause.
Skip a defined number of rows using the OFFSET clause in combination with LIMIT, enabling the implementation of pagination mechanisms in applications.
Understand how the use of LIMIT and OFFSET can help in loading data incrementally.
Ensure consistent and predictable output by combining these clauses with an ORDER BY statement, which helps maintain the desired row sequence between query executions.
Apply these result-limiting techniques in real-world use cases using the "sales" sample database, allowing you to efficiently navigate and manage large data sets within PostgreSQL.
