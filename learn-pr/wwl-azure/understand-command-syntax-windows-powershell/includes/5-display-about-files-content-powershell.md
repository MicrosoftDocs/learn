Although much of the help content in Windows PowerShell relates to commands, there are also many help files that describe PowerShell concepts. These files include information about the PowerShell scripting language, operators, and other details. This information doesn't specifically relate to a single command, but to global shell techniques and features.

You can review a complete list of these topics by running:

```powershell
Get-Help about*
```

To view a specific topic, use:

```powershell
Get-Help about_common_parameters
```

You can also open the help topic in a separate window or online:

```powershell
Get-Help about_common_parameters -ShowWindow
Get-Help about_common_parameters -Online
```

When you use wildcard characters with the **Get-Help** command, **About** help files will appear in a list when their titles contain a match for your wildcard pattern. Typically, **About** help files will appear last, after any commands whose names also matched your wildcard pattern. You can also use the *â€‘Category* parameter to specify a search for **About** files.

> [!NOTE] 
> For much of this course, you'll need to refer to **About** files for additional documentation. You must review these files frequently to discover the steps and techniques you need to complete lab exercises.
