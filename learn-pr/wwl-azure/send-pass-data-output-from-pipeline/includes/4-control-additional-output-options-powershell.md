PowerShell provides a variety of other options for controlling output. For example, you might not want to scroll through a long list of data returned by a command such as **Get-ADUser**. You can use the **Out-Host** command to force PowerShell to pause during each page of data it returns. You can force **Out-Host** to page the output when you use the *-Paging* parameter which causes PowerShell to prompt you for input after it displays one page of data on the screen.

If you want to print output, you can use the **Out-Printer** command to pipe data to your default printer (if you specify no parameter) or to a specific printer (if you specify the *-Name* positional parameter). If you want to review, sort, filter, and analyze output, and you don't need or want to keep a more permanent copy of the data stored in a CSV file or spreadsheet, you can send the output to a grid view window by using the **Out-GridView** command. The grid view window is an interactive window that works very much like a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet. It allows you to sort different columns, filter the data, and even copy data from the window to other programs. The one thing you can't do is save the data directly from the grid view window.
