  title: ""
  questions:
  - content: "Which cmdlet should a user pipe the output of **Get-ADUser** to in order to be able to display the list of results one page at a time in the PowerShell window?"
    choices:
    - content: "**Out-Host**"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. By piping the output of **Get-ADUser** cmdlet to the **Out-Host** cmdlet, you can use the **-Paging** parameter to display the output one page at a time in the PowerShell window."
    - content: "**ConvertTo-HTML**"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The **ConvertTo-HTML** cmdlet converts the output to the HTML format. It is by piping the output of **Get-ADUser** cmdlet to the **Out-Host** cmdlet, that you can use the **-Paging** parameter to display the output one page at a time in the PowerShell window."
    - content: "**Out-File**"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The **Out-File** cmdlet allows you to pipe an output of the pipeline to a file, but does not provide the option to display the output one page at a time in the PowerShell window. To do that, you must pipe the output of **Get-ADUser** cmdlet to the **Out-Host** cmdlet, and then use the **-Paging** parameter."
  - content: "Which symbol represents the alias of the **Out-File** cmdlet that results in overwriting content of an existing file?"
    choices:
    - content: "`$_`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The `$_`symbol is a variable that represents `$PSItem`. It is the `>`symbol that represents the alias of the **Out-File** cmdlet that results in overwriting content of an existing file."
    - content: "`%`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The `%` symbol represents an alias of the **ForEach-Object** cmdlet. It is the `>`symbol that represents the alias of the **Out-File** cmdlet that results in overwriting content of an existing file."
    - content: "`>`"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The `>`symbol represents the alias of the **Out-File** cmdlet that results in overwriting content of an existing file."
