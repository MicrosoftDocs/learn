This module covers the broad topic of Group Policy in Active Directory. Group Policy is a feature that allows administrators to define and deploy settings and configurations across their organizations.

## Scenario

Imagine you are an IT staff member at a large corporation. You are tasked with managing the configuration of hundreds of computers across multiple departments. The challenge is to enforce consistent settings and configurations, while also allowing for specific requirements of different departments. This is where Group Policy comes into play. With Group Policy, you can define settings centrally and deploy them to computers across your organization. You can affect an entire site or domain within your organization, or narrow your focus to a single organizational unit. Filtering based on security group membership and physical computer attributes further refines your target for Group Policy settings.

## Learning objectives

By the end of this module, you'll be able to:

 -  Define Group Policy Objects.
 -  Implement Group Policy Object scope and inheritance.
 -  Define domain-based Group Policy Objects.
 -  Create and configure a domain-based Group Policy Object.
 -  Configure a domain password policy.
 -  Configure and apply a fine-grained password policy.
