**SAP Business Technology Platform** (SAP BTP) is a cloud-based solution that provides a wide range of tools and services for developers to build, run, and manage applications. One of the key features of SAP BTP is its low-code development capabilities. Low-code development allows developers to create applications quickly and efficiently by using visual drag-and-drop interfaces and prebuilt components, rather than writing code from scratch.
