  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "What is the best definition of a console application?"
    choices:
    - content: "An application that consoles you and makes you feel better."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The answer implies a misunderstanding of the word console and how it is used in the context of a console application."
    - content: "An application that creates a graphical user interface, also called a GUI."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A console application displays its output as text, not as a GUI."
    - content: "An application that takes input and displays output at a command line console as text."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. A C# console application is a type of application that takes input and displays output at a command line console."
  - content: "What does the following line of code do? `if (ant.i < 0 || ant.j < 0 || ant.j >= Size || ant.i >= Size)`"
    choices:
    - content: "Make sure that there isn't more than one ant."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This line of code has nothing to do with the number of ants on the grid"
    - content: "Make sure that the ant is of a particular size."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This line of code has nothing to do with the size of an ant"
    - content: "Make sure that an ant is within the grid (i and j represent the lower and upper bound x, y coordinates)."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. This line of code is checking to see if an ant is still on the grid."
  - content: "Why use the Langton's Ant project as an exercise?"
    choices:
    - content: "To learn something about Alan Turing and the universal Turing machine."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Although you may do your own research on Alan Turing, he was not the primary reason for this exercise."
    - content: "To understand that by mimicking the behavior of ants we can learn to write better code."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This exercise was not about learning to write better code by observing ants."
    - content: "To learn about how to create and use classes, methods, and properties."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. This exercise was about learning to write code using object-oriented programming techniques."
