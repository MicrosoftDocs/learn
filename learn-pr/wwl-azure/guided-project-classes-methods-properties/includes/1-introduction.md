To develop object-oriented programs, you need to work with classes. This involves creating classes and understanding their composition. It’s also essential to learn about the properties and methods of a class and how they function.

Suppose you want to create a fun application that demonstrates the concept of a general-purpose computer. Langton’s Ant is a popular example of such an application. It was invented by Chris Langton in 1986 and runs on a grid of black and white cells. The ant’s movement is governed by a simple set of rules, yet it demonstrates complex behavior. The application is named after Alan Turing (b. 1912 – d. 1954), who is considered the father of computer science.

> A Turing machine is a hypothetical machine thought of by the mathematician Alan Turing in 1936. Despite its simplicity, the machine can simulate ANY computer algorithm, no matter how complicated it is!

This module will guide you through the process of building the Langton's Ant demonstration. You’ll start by setting up your application and then proceed to add the classes, methods, and properties that the application requires.

By the end of this module, you'll be able to write code that uses classes, properties, constructors, and reads user input.

## Learning objectives in this module

- Create a console application.
- Create an Ant class, add properties and methods, and a constructor.
- Read user input in a loop.
