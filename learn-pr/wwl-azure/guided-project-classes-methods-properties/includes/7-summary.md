##Summary

Your goal was to build an application based on Langton's Ant using many of the object-oriented programming skills you have been learning about. These skills include learning about what classes, methods, and properties your application needs and how to implement them.

To accomplish this goal, you created a console application, a Game and an Ant class, and developed a few properties and methods that create the grid for Langton's Ant.

By following along, breaking down the problem, and thinking about the goals of the application you were able to use some of your newly acquired skills to get started building Langton's Ant. Congratulations on taking this first big step!
