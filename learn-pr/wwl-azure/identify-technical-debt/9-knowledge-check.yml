  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "Which of the following choices is a characteristic in source code possibly indicating a deeper problem?"
    choices:
    - content: "Memory Leak."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Code smells are characteristics in your code that could be a problem. Code smells hint at more profound problems in the design or implementation of the code."
    - content: "Bug."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Code smells are characteristics in your code that could be a problem. Code smells hint at more profound problems in the design or implementation of the code."
    - content: "Code smell."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Code smells are characteristics in your code that could be a problem. Code smells hint at more profound problems in the design or implementation of the code."
  - content: "Which of the following choices can measure the probability that a system will run without failure over a specific period of operation?"
    choices:
    - content: "Maintainability"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Maintainability measures how easily software can be maintained. It relates to the codebase's size, consistency, structure, and complexity. And ensuring maintainable source code relies on several factors, such as testability and understandability."
    - content: "Reliability"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Reliability measures the probability that a system will run without failure over a specific period of operation. It relates to the number of defects and availability of the software. Several defects can be measured by running a static analysis tool."
    - content: "Reusability"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Reusability measures whether existing assets, such as code."
