  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "To test that peering connectivity has been configured correctly, which option should be chosen from the ExpressRoute circuit page?"
    choices:
    - content: "Connections"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This option won't test whether peering connectivity has been configured correctly."
    - content: "Diagnose and solve problems"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. This option will test whether peering connectivity has been configured correctly."
    - content: "Configuration"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This option won't test whether peering connectivity has been configured correctly."
  - content: "While configuring peering connections between four VNets, peering connections have been created between VNetA and VNetB, between VNetB and VNetC, and between VNetC and VNetD. When the configuration is tested, there's a connection problem between VNetA and VNetD. What is the cause of this problem?"
    choices:
    - content: "There's an error in one of the peerings. Check the configuration and retest"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This isn't due to an error in one of the peerings."
    - content: "This is by design, and the configuration isn't supported"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. This configuration isn't supported. You must create an additional peering or use a hub-and-spoke configuration."
    - content: "Peerings must have a bidirectional link. Create two links for each peering"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The error isn't due to a missing link."
  - content: "While troubleshooting failed connections on a WAN, on investigating the problem, the Routing Status on the virtual hub is displaying \"Failed\". How can this be resolved?"
    choices:
    - content: "Reset both the router and the hub"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This won't bring failed resources such as route tables, hub router, or the virtual hub resource back to the provisioning state."
    - content: "Select the Reset Router option for the virtual hub"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. This will bring failed resources such as route tables, hub router, or the virtual hub resource back to the provisioning state."
    - content: "Select the Reset Hub option for the Virtual Router"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This won't bring failed resources such as route tables, hub router, or the virtual hub resource back to the provisioning state."
