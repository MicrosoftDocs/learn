  questions:
  - content: "Which option correctly declares an interface in C#?"
    choices:
    - content: "`interface MyInterface = new Interface();`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Interfaces can't be created with the `new` keyword."
    - content: "`interface MyInterface : MyClass { }`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Interfaces can't inherit classes."
    - content: "`interface MyInterface { void MyMethod(); }`"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! Interfaces are created using brackets and including method signatures."
  - content: "Which statement is true about interfaces?"
    choices:
    - content: "An interface defines a contract for a behavior that a class must implement."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. An interface specifies what the class should do, but implementation details are left up to the class."
    - content: "Classes don't need to implement all of the methods defined in an interface"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A class implementing an interface must implement all of its methods and properties."
    - content: "An interface is a substitute for an abstract class."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Interfaces define a contract for what an object must *do*, an abstract class provides a structure for what an object *is*."
  - content: "Which of the following is a system defined interface?"
    choices:
    - content: "IConsumable"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. IConsumable isn't a system defined interface."
    - content: "IEnumerable"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! IEnumerable is a system defined interface that allows for iteration over a collection"
    - content: "IDeletable"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. IDeletable isn't a system defined interface."
