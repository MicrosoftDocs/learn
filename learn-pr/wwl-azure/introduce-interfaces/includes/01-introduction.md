As you begin to develop larger projects, you might identify similarities between the different types of classes you create. For example, suppose you are in charge of developing an inventory for a roleplaying game. The player can collect different types of items, such as armor, weapons, potions, food, and more. Each of these different items also supports a behavior, for example, armor and weapons are equipable, and food and potions are consumable. You want to structure your code to be modular, flexible, and easy to understand. Interfaces are a way to do just that.

Interfaces are a powerful tool for creating organized, maintainable code. This makes them crucial for large scale projects with many developers. As you continue your developer journey, you'll come across many implementations of all types of interfaces! 

In this module, you'll get hands-on experience creating interfaces to add specific behaviors to different classes. You'll also learn to use system defined interfaces to extend classes. By the end of this module, you'll be able to use interfaces to create modular, robust code!

## Learning objectives

In this module, you will:

- Create and implement interfaces
- Understand why interfaces are useful in object-oriented programming
- Learn to use system defined interfaces

## Prerequisites

- Visual Studio Code installed
- Basic knowledge of the Visual Studio Code IDE
- Basic understanding of the C# programming language
- Familiarity with classes, abstract classes, and inheritance
