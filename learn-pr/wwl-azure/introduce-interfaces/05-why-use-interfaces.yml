  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "Which of the following best describes an interface in C#?"
    choices:
    - content: "An interface is a concrete class that provides default behavior for a specific type"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Interfaces are abstract types."
    - content: "An interface is a blueprint for a class that defines a set of methods and properties that a class must implement."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! Interfaces provide a blueprint for classes, specifying a set of methods and properties that implementing classes must define."
    - content: "An interface is a static class that provides utility functions for a specific type."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. An interface is an abstract type that specifies functionality to be implemented"
  - content: "Which of the following is a benefit of using interfaces in C#?"
    choices:
    - content: "Interfaces help reduce tight coupling between classes"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Interfaces help reduce tight coupling"
    - content: "Interfaces prevent modularized unit testing"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Interfaces help isolate and test specific functionality"
    - content: "Interfaces increase dependencies between classes"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Interfaces help reduce tight coupling by providing abstraction"
