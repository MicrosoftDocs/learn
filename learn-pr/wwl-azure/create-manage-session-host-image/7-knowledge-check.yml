  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "What should be used to enable image sharing?"
    choices:
    - content: "Azure VM Image Builder"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. With Azure VM Image Builder you can describe custom images in a template using new or existing configurations. The template enables VM image building immediately without setting up and managing your own image building pipeline."
    - content: "Azure Marketplace"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The Microsoft Azure Marketplace is an online store that offers applications and services either built on or designed to integrate with Microsoft's Azure public cloud. The products and services sold through the Microsoft Azure Marketplace come from either Microsoft directly or its technology partners."
    - content: "Shared Image Gallery (SIG)"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Using a Shared Image Gallery you can share your images to different users, service principals, or AD groups within and outside your organization. Shared images can be replicated to multiple regions, for quicker scaling of your deployments."
  - content: "What is the most efficient and cost-effective way to manage the language needs for users of a Windows 10 Enterprise multi-session image?"
    choices:
    - content: "Build dedicated host pools with a customized image for each language"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Building a dedicated host pool with a customized image for each language will not allow users to customize their images by selecting whichever language they need."
    - content: "Proved access to the Shared Image Galleries images"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Providing access to the Shared Image Galleries images will not allow users to customize their images by selecting whichever language they need."
    - content: "Customize the images to ensure they can select whichever language they need"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Have users with different language and localization requirements in the same host pool, so customize their images to ensure they can select whichever language they need."
