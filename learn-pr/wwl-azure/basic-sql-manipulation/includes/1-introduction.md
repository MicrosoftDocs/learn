<!-- 1. Topic sentences ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Goal: Orient the learner to the area covered in this module.

    Heading: None

    Example: "Good cybersecurity relies on many factors to provide confidence and assurance that your data
             is safe and being used as expected."

    Recommended: Add a visual like an image, table, or list that supports the topic sentences.

Understanding the fundamentals of SQL commands and the Data Manipulation Language (DML) in PostgreSQL is essential for professionals working with this powerful database system. Mastering DML empowers you to efficiently manage data by providing commands to insert, update, and delete records within a database.

<!-- 2. Motivation ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Goal: Explain why the concepts that the module covers are important and how they're used. Consider
          posing a question or describing a challenging situation.

    Heading: None

    Example: "In the early years of computing systems, every application stored data in its own unique
             structure. When developers wanted to build applications to use that data, they had to know
             a lot about the data structure to find the data they needed. These structures were
             inefficient, hard to maintain, and hard to optimize for good application performance. The
             relational database model was designed to solve the problem of multiple arbitrary data
             structures. The relational model provides a standard way of representing and querying
             data that can be used by any application."
-->
By developing a strong foundation in DML, you can enhance data integrity, streamline database operations, and ensure optimal performance in data-driven applications. Additionally, knowledge of DML is beneficial for enabling seamless collaboration between teams, as it provides a standardized approach to managing and manipulating data. It also equips professionals with the skills to handle complex data workflows, troubleshoot issues effectively, and optimize database performance, making it a critical competency in today's data-centric industries.

<!-- 4. Prose table of contents --------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Goal: List the activities that the learner does in this module. The prose table of contents differs
          from the title and the learning objectives. The title and the learning objectives are outcome-
          focused. They describe the skills the learner acquires as a result of consuming this content.
          In contrast, the prose table of contents states specifically what the learner **does** in order
          to acquire those skills. The format can be either prose or a bulleted list. But a list yields
          better results when transformed into other output types such as PowerPoint.

    Heading: "## What will we be doing?"

    Example: "In this module, we'll formally define several cybersecurity concepts like authentication
             and authorization. Then we'll put the concepts into context by describing some common
             authentication-based attacks. We'll also define some effective authorization security techniques."
 -->
 # What will we be doing?

 This tutorial provides a comprehensive overview data of basic SQL commands, specifically focusing on Data Manipulation Language (DML) in PostgreSQL. It begins with brief explanation on what commands we will be covering in this tutorial such as : INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, UPSERT. This tutorial will guide you through the syntax and practical applications of these commands. All examples will be demonstrated using the built-in "Sales" database, providing a hands-on learning experience in a structured enviroment.

 <!-- 5. Terminal learning objective ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Goal: Restate the module title as a complete sentence. You have more room here to convey the main goal
          than in a space-limited title. Make it outcome-focused so it describes the main skills and
          knowledge the learner acquires as a result of the training. Answer the question "What is the
          foundational knowledge the user gains as a result of consuming this training?"

    Heading: "## What is the main goal?"

    Example: "By the end of the module, you'll have a comprehensive understanding of core cybersecurity concepts."
 -->
## What is the main goal?

By the end of this tutorial, you will have a comprehensive understanding of basic Data Manipulation Language (DML) commands in PostgreSQL. You will be equipped with the knowledge and skills to effectively insert, update, delete, and manage data within a database. This foundational expertise will enable you to confidently handle data-driven tasks, optimize database operations, and contribute to the success of data-centric projects.
