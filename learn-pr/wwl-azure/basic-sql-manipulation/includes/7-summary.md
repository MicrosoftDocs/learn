This tutorial is designed to equip learners with the essential skills for manipulating data in PostgreSQL databases using DML (Data Manipulation Language) commands. You should now be able to:

Insert new records into tables using the INSERT statement, whether adding single rows, multiple rows, or data derived from other tables via subqueries.
Update existing records using the UPDATE command, including conditional updates, updates based on subqueries, and dynamic changes using the CASE expression.
Delete specific rows or entire sets of data with the DELETE statement, while understanding the impact of foreign key constraints and how to handle them using techniques like ON DELETE CASCADE.
Perform UPSERT operations using INSERT ... ON CONFLICT, enabling you to either insert new data or update existing rows when conflicts arise, with the ability to return affected rows using the RETURNING clause.
Apply these data manipulation techniques in practical, real-world scenarios using the "Sales" sample database, preparing you to confidently manage and transform data within any PostgreSQL environment.
