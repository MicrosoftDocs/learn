In this tutorial, we will focus on basic SQL commands for data manipulation, known as DML (Data Manipulation Language). DML commands allow you to insert, update and delete data from a database. These are fundamental operations commonly used in everyday database management. 

## The commands we will cover include: 

* INSERT - to add new records to a table.You can insert data into specific columns or all columns of the table.
* UPDATE - to modify existing recrds. YOu can modify columns, update single or multiple rows, and set values using constants, expressions or subqueries.
* DELETE - to remove records from a table based on specific conditions. This command allows you to delete individual or multiple rows, or even all rows from a table.
* UPSERT - combination of two operations : INSERT and UPDATE. Database operation that inserts a new row if it does not exist or updades the existing row instead of inserting a duplicate.
