  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "How does ExpressRoute FastPath send network traffic?"
    choices:
    - content: "Directly to virtual machines in the virtual network."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. FastPath sends network traffic directly to virtual machines in the virtual network, bypassing the gateway."
    - content: "Through the gateway to Virtual machines."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. ExpressRoute FastPath does not send traffic through the gateway to virtual machines."
    - content: "Through the public internet."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. ExpressRoute FastPath does not send traffic through the public internet."
  - content: "A network has multiple VNets peered with the VNet that is connected to ExpressRoute. How should the ExpressRoute FastPath deployment be modified?"
    choices:
    - content: "Connect the VNet gateways to ExpressRoute FastPath."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The VNet gateways still support VNet-to-Vnet peering and should not be connected directly to FastPath."
    - content: "Connect all the virtual networks to the ExpressRoute FastPath circuit directly."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. To avoid traffic being routed through the VNet gateways, connect all the VNets to ExpressRoute FastPath circuit directly."
    - content: "Modify the VNet peering configuration."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The VNet gateways can still support VNet-to-Vnet peering and do not have to be modified."
