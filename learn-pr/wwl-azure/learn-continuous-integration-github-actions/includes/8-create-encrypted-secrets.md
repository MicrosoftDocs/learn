Actions often can use `secrets` within pipelines. Common examples are passwords or keys.

In GitHub actions, It's called **`Secrets`**.

## `Secrets`

`Secrets` are similar to environment variables but encrypted. They can be created at two levels:

- Repository
- Organization

If `secrets` are created at the organization level, access policies can limit the repositories that can use them.

## Creating `secrets` for a repository

To create `secrets` for a repository, you must be the repository's owner. From the repository **`Settings`**, choose **`Secrets`**, then **`New Secret`**.
