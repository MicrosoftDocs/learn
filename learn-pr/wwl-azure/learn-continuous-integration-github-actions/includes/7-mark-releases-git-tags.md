Releases are software iterations that can be packed for release.

In Git, releases are based on Git tags. These tags mark a point in the history of the repository. Tags are commonly assigned as releases are created.

Often these tags will contain version numbers, but they can have other values.

Tags can then be viewed in the history of a repository.
