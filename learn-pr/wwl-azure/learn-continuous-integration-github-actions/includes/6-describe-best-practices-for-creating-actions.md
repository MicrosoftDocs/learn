It's essential to follow best practices when creating `actions`:

- Create chainable `actions`. Don't create large monolithic `actions`. Instead, create smaller functional `actions` that can be chained together.
- Version your `actions` like other code. Others might take dependencies on various versions of your `actions`. Allow them to specify versions.
- Provide the **`latest`** label. If others are happy to use the latest version of your `action`, make sure you provide the **`latest`** label that they can specify to get it.
- Add appropriate documentation. As with other codes, documentation helps others use your `actions` and can help avoid surprises about how they function.
- Add details **`action.yml`** metadata. At the root of your `action`, you'll have an **`action.yml`** file. Ensure it has been populated with author, icon, expected inputs, and outputs.
- Consider contributing to the marketplace. It's easier for us to work with `actions` when we all contribute to the marketplace. Help to avoid people needing to relearn the same issues endlessly.
