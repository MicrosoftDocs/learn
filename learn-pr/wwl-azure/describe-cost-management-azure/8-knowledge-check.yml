  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "What Azure feature can help stay organized and track usage based on metadata associated with resources?"
    choices:
    - content: "Tags"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Tags allow you to associate metadata with a resource to help keep track of resource management, costs and optimization, security, and so on."
    - content: "Tracers"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Assigning tags to a resource lets you add metadata to the resource for improved reporting."
    - content: "Values"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Assigning tags to a resource lets you add metadata to the resource for improved reporting."
  - content: "What’s the best method to estimate the cost of migrating to the cloud while incurring minimal costs?"
    choices:
    - content: "Migrate a small sample to the cloud and track costs over time."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Migrating a small sample to the cloud may help you estimate the costs of a future full-migration, but consider using the total cost of ownership calculator for an even early estimate."
    - content: "Use the Total Cost of Ownership calculator to estimate expected costs."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The Total Cost of Ownership calculator lets you input your current infrastructure and requirements and provides you with an estimate for running in the cloud."
    - content: "Migrate to the cloud, but track usage closely using tags to rapidly understand costs."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While you would get the most accurate information with this approach, it would also be the most expensive and would entail a full migration."
