The pricing calculator is a calculator that helps you understand potential Azure expenses. The pricing calculator is accessible from the internet and allows you to build out a configuration. The Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) calculator has been retired.

## Pricing calculator

The pricing calculator is designed to give you an estimated cost for provisioning resources in Azure. You can get an estimate for individual resources, build out a solution, or use an example scenario to see an estimate of the Azure spend. The pricing calculatorâ€™s focus is on the cost of provisioned resources in Azure.

> [!NOTE]
> The Pricing calculator is for information purposes only. The prices are only an estimate. Nothing is provisioned when you add resources to the pricing calculator, and you won't be charged for any services you select.

With the pricing calculator, you can estimate the cost of any provisioned resources, including compute, storage, and associated network costs. You can even account for different storage options like storage type, access tier, and redundancy.
