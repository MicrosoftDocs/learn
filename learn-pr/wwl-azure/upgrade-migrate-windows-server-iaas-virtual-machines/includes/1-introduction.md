You can migrate a workload running in Windows Server to an infrastructure as a service (IaaS) virtual machine (VM) and to Windows Server 2025 by using Windows Server migration tools or the Storage Migration Service.

## Scenario

Contoso is a medium-size financial services company in London with a branch office in New York. Most of its compute environment runs on-premises on Windows Server. This includes virtualized workloads on Windows Server 2012 R2 hosts. Contoso's IT staff are in the process of migrating Contoso servers to Windows Server 2025.

Contosoâ€™s IT director realizes that Contoso has an outdated operational model with limited automation and reliance on dated technology. The Contoso IT Engineering team has started exploring Azure capabilities. They want to determine whether Azure services might assist with modernizing the current operational model through automation and virtualization. 

As part of the initial design, the Contoso IT team asked you, their lead system engineer and server administrator, to set up a proof of concept environment. This environment must verify whether Azure services can help to modernize the IT infrastructure and meet business goals. 

One of the first tasks you must do is to plan the process of migrating on-premises resources such as file servers, to Azure IaaS VMs. In this module, you learn about performing a Windows Server IaaS migration. You learn to migrate workloads using the appropriate Windows Server migration tools. Finally, you learn to migrate file servers using the Storage Migration Service, and to migrate on-premises resources to Azure.

By the end of the module, you are able to lead Contoso's IT team in migrating their on-premises resources.
