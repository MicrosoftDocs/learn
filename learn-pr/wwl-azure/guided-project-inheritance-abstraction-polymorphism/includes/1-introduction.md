Code reuse and optimization are one of the main benefits of an object-oriented programming language. Through inheritance, one of the four tenets of object-oriented programming, you'll understand why.

Suppose you want to create another instance of the LangotnsAnts application. Instead of duplicating the code and maintaining multiple sets of code separately, you can use inheritance and code reuse to create other instances. This approach allows you to create and manage multiple instances more efficiently.

In this module, you'll learn how to repurpose your code to better support reuse. Just as functions are standalone pieces of code you can reuse for different purposes, so can classes. We'll demonstrate this concept by using inheritance to create a `GeneralizedAnt` class. This will allow you to reuse your code more effectively.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you'll practice how to:

- How to use inheritance.
- Understand the benefits of code reuse.

## Prerequisites

- Installation of Visual Studio Code configured for C# application development, including C# Dev Kit.
- Experience with the VS Code editor.
- Ability to develop C# console applications that implement business logic using loops, if statements, properties, and methods.
- Experience with basic C# syntax rules.
