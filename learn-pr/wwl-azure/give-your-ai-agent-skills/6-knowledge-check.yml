  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "What is the purpose of a native function in the Semantic Kernel SDK?"
    choices:
    - content: "To customize prompts and generated responses."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Native functions aren't used to create custom prompts."
    - content: "To summarize conversations and chat history"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Native functions are used to run native code in the application."
    - content: "To create skills that can be invoked by the kernel."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Native functions can be used by the kernel to augment your intelligent application."
  - content: "How does the Semantic Kernel SDK enable automatic invocation of functions?"
    choices:
    - content: "By setting the `FunctionChoiceBehavior` property to `Auto()`."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. This setting allows the kernel to automatically choose and invoke the appropriate functions."
    - content: "By using function calls in response to specific prompts only."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Functions can be automatically invoked based on user input with the right configuration."
    - content: "By writing custom scripts to trigger functions based on keywords."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Automatic invocation is controlled by setting properties in the SDK, not through custom scripts."
  - content: "What does function advertising allow in the Semantic Kernel SDK?"
    choices:
    - content: "It lets you automatically generate functions based on user inputs."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Function advertising does not generate functions automatically."
    - content: "It lets you control which functions are accessible to the AI model during execution."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Function advertising allows you to select which functions are available for the AI model to invoke based on the scenario."
    - content: "It automatically invokes functions without requiring a prompt from the user."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Function advertising is about choosing which functions can be invoked, prompts are still required for invocation."
