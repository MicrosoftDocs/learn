The Semantic Kernel SDK empowers developers to interact with Large Language Models (LLMs) through plugins that run natural language prompts. However, you can also create plugins with native code! Whether it's data manipulation, complex calculations, or specialized functionality, the ability to integrate native code with LLMs can help you create versatile, feature-rich applications.

Suppose you want to create an artificially intelligent (AI) disc jockey that can tailor a user's music listening experience. You can use native functions to interact with a music library, add songs to a user's "Recently Played" list, and recommend songs and concerts. With native functions, your music listening service can now act as an AI agent with skills to enhance the user's experience.

In this module, you learn how native functions work in the Semantic Kernel SDK. You can understand how native functions can accomplish customized tasks, effectively giving your AI agent a "skill." You also practice how to combine prompts with native functions to build intelligent applications.
