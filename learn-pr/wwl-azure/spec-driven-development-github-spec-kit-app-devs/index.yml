abstract: |
  By the end of this module, you're able to:
    - Explain Spec-Driven Development principles (upfront clarity, fewer regressions, easier maintenance).
    - Apply the GitHub Spec Kit in an offline web app scenario, encoding industry guidelines (security, performance, compliance) in a constitution.md file that guides code development.
    - Implement the GitHub Spec Kit and GitHub Copilot in Visual Studio Code to generate project artifacts (specification, plan, and tasks).
    - Execute a spec-driven workflow to develop an offline web app, from spec creation through automated code generation.
prerequisites: |
  - Experience using GitHub Copilot in Visual Studio Code.
  - Experience developing applications.
