Application performance management (APM) is a discipline that includes all the tools and activities involved in observing how software and hardware are doing.

These tools present performance information in the form product owners and software development teams can use to make decisions.

Application Insights is a Microsoft Azure native APM Tool that is cross-platform. It's specialized in providing a rich & intelligent performance management toolset for Azure hosted web apps.

In this tutorial, we'll learn how to get started with App Insights. We'll cover,

 -  Adding App Insights to your dotnet core app
 -  Accessing App Insights from within the Azure portal

## Getting started

1.  To add Application Insights to your [ASP.NET](http://asp.net/) website, you need to:
     -  Install Visual Studio 2019 for Windows with the following workloads:
     -  [ASP.NET](http://asp.net/) and web development (Don't uncheck the optional components)

2.  In Visual Studio, create a new dotnet core project. Right-click the project, and from the context menu, select `Add, Application Insights Telemetry.`

    (Depending on your Application Insights SDK version, you may be prompted to upgrade to the latest SDK release. If prompted, select Update SDK.)

3.  From the Application Insights configuration screen, click Get started to start setting up App Insights.<br>:::image type="content" source="../media/application-Insights-get-started-d3b5168d.png" alt-text="Application Insights Get Started":::
    
4.  Choose to set up a new resource group and select the location where you want the telemetry data to be persisted.

## Summary

So far, we have added App Insights in a dotnet core application.

The Application Insights getting started experience gives you the ability to create a new resource group in the wished location where the App Insights instance gets created.

The instrumentation key for the app insights instance is injected into the application configuration automatically.

## How to do it

1.  Run your app with F5. Open different pages to generate some telemetry. In Visual Studio, you'll see a count of the events that have been logged.

2.  You can see your telemetry either in Visual Studio or in the Application Insights web portal. Search telemetry in Visual Studio to help you debug your app. Monitor performance and usage in the web portal when your system is live. In Visual Studio, to view Application Insights data. Select Solution Explorer &gt; Connected Services &gt; right-click Application Insights, and then click Search-Live Telemetry.

    In the Visual Studio Application Insights Search window, you'll see the data from your application for telemetry generated on the server-side of your app. Experiment with the filters, and click any event to see more detail.

3.  You can also see telemetry in the Application Insights web portal (unless you choose to install only the SDK). The portal has more charts, analytic tools, and cross-component views than Visual Studio. The portal also provides alerts.

    Open your Application Insights resource. Either sign into the Azure portal and find it there, or select Solution Explorer &gt; Connected Services &gt; right-click Application Insights &gt; Open Application Insights Portal and let it take you there.

    The portal opens on a view of the telemetry from your app.

## How it works

Application Insights configures a unique key (called AppInsights Key) in your application. The Application Insights SDK uses this key to identify the Azure App Insights workspace the telemetry data needs to be uploaded. The SDK and the key are merely used to pump the telemetry data points out of your application. The heavy lifting of data correlation, analysis, and insights is done within Azure.
