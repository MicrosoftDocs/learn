Scientist Arthur C. Clark once said, "Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic." When you use modern computers like a phone or gaming device it's hard not to say "Wow, magic!" (at least occasionally).

While the things modern computers can do are magical, you can understand a bit how they actually work. Really, how computers work is rather simple. The magic in computer systems comes from doing something simple quickly and many, many times. So when you turn on that cell phone or talk to your Alexa or Siri or Google, what's going on?

## Did You Turn It Off and On?

The British comedy series *The IT Crowd* made a joke out of "turn it off and on again". If you want to fix a computer problem, turn it off and back on. Crude but effective.

It may sound funny but the basic model of what a computer is doing is based on this idea.

Computing was invented by a scientist named Alan Turing. Turing realized that all computer problems can be broken down into a simple language. It's called a digital language: 0 and 1. This language is at the core of all the computers you use.

## Simple to Complex

When you press the letter A on a keyboard, the keyboard sends a signal to the brains of the computer. The brain changes the signal into a set of ones and zeros. When the brain gets that set of ones and zeros, it sends another signal to the screen to draw the letter A. All modern computers use the same model to do everything they do.
