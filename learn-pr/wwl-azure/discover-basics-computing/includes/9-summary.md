This module explored how the data, the 1s and 0s that fly around the internet, gets to where it needs to be. You explored the basics of networks and reviewed how smaller networks talk to larger networks. This module covered:

- How computers work and how they share data.
- The special identity of devices, which are called MAC addresses. No two devices share a MAC address.
- What a virtual private network is. They help businesses give their workers secure access to company data.
- How devices are identified on a network using IP addresses.
- How web addresses link to IP addresses so you can get to the website you want.

Even though you learned a bit about how things work, hopefully it doesn't make them any less magical. Magic, after all, is a sense of wonder, and that has been the promise of the internet: enabling you to do things you only dreamed of doing.
