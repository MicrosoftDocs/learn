      explanation: "Incorrect. Conditional access is a tool to help implement Zero Trust within your identity solutions using Azure AD."
    - content: "Multifactor authentication - Conditional access - Privilege identity management"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The terms listed are tools and capabilities in Azure AD to help you reach a Zero Trust configuration."
  - content: "What is decentralized identity?"
    choices:
    - content: "Storing all your user and device identities in Active Directory on-premises and then using Azure AD Connect to apply them in the cloud."

      explanation: "Incorrect. Azure AD is an example of a centralized identity system."
  - content: "What is claims-based authentication?"
    choices:
    - content: "When a user signs in, Azure AD creates and sends an ID token that contains a set of claims about the user."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. A Jason web token is used to establish a user's identity and the services they want to access."
    - content: "When a user doesn't need to sign in, but sends a claim directly to a cloud resource to access it.  The claim is in the form of a Jason Web Token, and provides the user sign-in information."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Claims-based authentication issues the token after the user is verified."
    - content: "When a user signs in, Azure AD writes every access privilege the user has into a token and shares it with each application."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The token and claims are issued on a per request basis."
