What is a control plane? A **control plane** is a core networking concept referring to the system that manages and directs traffic flow within a network. In modern architectures, identity serves as the control plane, governing access to resources based on authentication and authorization policies.

With the proliferation of networks, devices, and applications, identity is the universal element linking users, devices, and services. Establishing a trusted identity is fundamental to access control. Without verified identity, no security mechanism is effective. Once identity is confirmed, access to resources, whether on-premises, in the cloud, or in SaaS platforms, can be explicitly managed and enforced.
