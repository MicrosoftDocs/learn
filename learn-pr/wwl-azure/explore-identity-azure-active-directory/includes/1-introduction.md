This module will cover a wide view of the definitions and available services for identity provided in the Microsoft Cloud from Azure AD to Microsoft 365.  You start with the basics of authentication, authorization, and access tokens.

From this firm foundation of what an identity is, why it's important we explore deeper scenarios. We move into governance and lifecycle management of your identities and identity solutions. The final section opens up the concept of zero trust, and how it should be applied to your identity solutions. What is the Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) architecture and the connection with identity in Microsoft 365?

Next you explore the tools available to build and managed your identity solution like PowerShell and Microsoft Graph. The goal of this module is to prepare your technical knowledge of identity and access management in the Microsoft Cloud.

In this module, you will:
- Define the concept of central identity system and decentralized identity
- Review systems of authentication and authorization in Azure AD
- Explore identity governance, and identity lifecycle management
- Define the value of identity audits (reporting, monitoring)
- Review how cryptography is used in identity (encryption, hashing)
- Describe federated identity concepts (for example SAML)
- Describe the different management automation interfaces PowerShell, CLI, and Graph API
- Describe Zero Trust concepts
- Describe Azure AD architecture and its relationship with Microsoft 365
- Define an identity provider and identity as a control plane
- Compare different identity services - Azure AD, Azure AD DS, AD DS
- Explain Azure AD business-to-busines (B2C) and business-to-customer (B2C)
- Review licenses to run an identity solution in the Microsoft Cloud

### Learning objectives

By the end of this module will be able to:

- Define common identity terms and explain how they're used in the Microsoft Cloud
- Explore the common management tools and needs of an identity solution
- Review the goal of Zero Trust and how it's applied in the Microsoft Cloud
- Explore the available identity services in the Microsoft Cloud
