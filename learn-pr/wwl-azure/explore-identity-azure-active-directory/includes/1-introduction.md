This module covers a wide view of the definitions and available services for identity provided in the Microsoft Cloud from Microsoft Entra ID to Microsoft 365.  You start with the basics of authentication, authorization, and access tokens.

From this firm foundation of what an identity is, we explore how identity is used as part of your security foundation. We learn about governance and lifecycle management of your identities and identity solutions. The final section opens up the concept of zero trust, and how it should be applied to your identity solutions. What is the Microsoft Entra ID architecture and the connection with identity in Microsoft 365?

Next you explore how PowerShell and Microsoft Graph are available to build and manage identity solutions. The goal of this module is to prepare your technical knowledge of identity and access management in the Microsoft Cloud.

In this module, you will:
- Define the concept of central identity system and decentralized identity
- Review systems of authentication and authorization in Microsoft Entra ID
- Explore identity governance, and identity lifecycle management
- Define the value of identity audits (reporting, monitoring)
- Review how cryptography is used in identity (encryption, hashing)
- Describe federated identity concepts (for example SAML)
- Describe the different management automation interfaces PowerShell, CLI, and Graph API
- Describe Zero Trust concepts
- Describe Microsoft Entra ID architecture and its relationship with Microsoft 365
- Define an identity provider and identity as a control plane
- Compare different identity services - Microsoft Entra ID, Microsoft Entra DS, AD DS
- Explain Microsoft Entra business-to-busines (B2B) and business-to-customer (B2C)
- Review licenses to run an identity solution in the Microsoft Cloud


### Learning objectives
