  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "Approximately how long would the data transfer component of a fully optimized very large database (VLDB) migration to Azure take, if the database size is 30 TB?"
    choices:
    - content: "3 hours"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A throughput of 10 TB per hour (needed to migrate 30 TB in 3 hours) is unlikely."
    - content: "15 hours"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. A fully optimized VLDB migration should achieve around 2 TB per hour migration throughput or possibly more. A throughput of 10 TB per hour (needed to migrate 30 TB in 3 hours) is unlikely."
    - content: "30 hours"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A fully optimized VLDB migration should achieve around 2 TB per hour migration throughput or possibly more."
  - content: "In a very large database migration, commonly four export R3load servers are used. Typically, what is export server 1 dedicated to?"
    choices:
    - content: "The largest 1-4 tables in the database"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Export server 1 is typically dedicated to the largest 1-4 tables (depending on how skewed the data distribution is on the source database)."
    - content: "The largest 50-100 tables in the database"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Export server 1 is typically dedicated to the largest 1-4 tables (depending on how skewed the data distribution is on the source database)."
    - content: "Any tables with table splits"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Export server 1 is typically dedicated to the largest 1-4 tables (depending on how skewed the data distribution is on the source database)."
  - content: "When optimizing the source system for a very large database export, which solution should be used to run R3load processes?"
    choices:
    - content: "UNIX server"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Don't run R3load on UNIX servers as the performance is poor. Two-socket commodity Intel servers with 128 GB RAM cost little and will save days or weeks of tuning/optimization or consulting time."
    - content: "Intel CPU"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. R3load should run on a fast new Intel CPU. Don't run R3load on UNIX servers as the performance is poor. Two-socket commodity Intel servers with 128 GB RAM cost little and will save days or weeks of tuning/optimization or consulting time."
    - content: "Either of the other choices, there's no significant difference in performance."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. R3load should run on a fast new Intel CPU. Don't run R3load on UNIX servers as the performance is poor. Two-socket commodity Intel servers with 128 GB RAM cost little and will save days or weeks of tuning/optimization or consulting time."
  - content: "When migrating a very large database, what is the benefit of creating multiple clones of the source database and exporting in parallel?"
    choices:
    - content: "Exporting is faster."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. If the underlying infrastructure including servers, network, and storage are scalable, then this approach tends to be linearly scalable. Exporting from two copies of the same database will be twice as fast, four copies will be four times as fast."
    - content: "It reduces the chance of data loss or inconsistencies."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Exporting in parallel is unlikely to reduce the chance of data loss or inconsistencies."
    - content: "It allows larger databases to be migrated, which might otherwise exceed the migration size limit."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Exporting in parallel doesn't allow larger databases to be migrated."
  - content: "Given the following SQL statement for migrations: select session_id, request_id, start_time, status, command, wait_type, wait_resource, wait_time, last_wait_type, blocking_session_id from sys.dm_exec_requests where session_id &gt;49 orderby wait_time desc; During the runtime of the database import, when and how often should the SQL statement be run?"
    choices:
    - content: "Once, at the end of the import process."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The monitoring, logging, and diagnostics that are configured during Development, Test and “dry run” migrations are important components of a VLDB migration. It's recommended to execute the SQL statement every few minutes during the runtime of the DB import, and document anything abnormal (such as high wait times)."
    - content: "Every few minutes throughout the import process."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The monitoring, logging, and diagnostics that are configured during Development, Test and “dry run” migrations are important components of a VLDB migration. It's recommended to execute the SQL statement every few minutes during the runtime of the DB import, and document anything abnormal (such as high wait times)."
    - content: "Once at the start of the import process, and once at the end of the import process."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The monitoring, logging, and diagnostics that are configured during Development, Test and “dry run” migrations are important components of a VLDB migration. It's recommended to execute the SQL statement every few minutes during the runtime of the DB import, and document anything abnormal (such as high wait times)."
