## Key Takeaways

 -  **Microsoft’s “cloud”** is a worldwide network of powerful computer datacenters. **Microsoft Azure** is a collection of services that connect you to that cloud via the Internet.
 -  **You can think of Azure as a subscription IT service delivered via the Internet**. Azure can wholly or partially replace your business’s existing IT system.
 -  Cloud-based IT can **save your business money** by eliminating the capital costs of buying and maintaining physical IT systems.
 -  **Azure is far more cost-efficient, powerful, agile, reliable, and secure than off-cloud IT systems**. Its power and reach enable your business to grow faster, more easily coordinate your workforce, gather and analyze huge amounts of data, and offer new and high-tech products.
 -  **Cloud economics is all about operational expenditures and a consumption-based model**. You’ll be paying for what you use when you need it, and not fretting over capital expenditures.
 -  **The cloud makes it easy to scale operations and spending**. You can pay for more computing power when you need it for a large project or spike in customer engagement, then scale back down later.
 -  If you’re not ready to go all-in on the cloud, **you can use Azure in tandem with off-cloud IT in a hybrid arrangement**.

In the next unit, we’ll explore the concepts of cloud economics a little deeper.
