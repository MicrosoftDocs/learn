Welcome to the **Get to know Microsoft Azure cloud platform: An overview for business professionals** learning path!

This learning path consists of three modules designed for business decision makers looking to learn more about the cloud and Microsoft Azure.

These modules focus on the business aspects of Azure and the cloud without requiring a technical background. If you do have a technical background, this module can help you better understand the business impacts of cloud technology.

After you complete the learning path, you should have a better sense of what the cloud is, what Azure is, how they can benefit a business, and what to anticipate if your business decides to adopt Azure.

This first module, **Describe the basics of Azure for business**, presents an overview of how Azure works and what it might do for your business.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this module, you’ll be able to:

 -  Describe what the cloud is and what Microsoft Azure is.
 -  Describe the basics of cloud economics, and how the consumption-based, operational expenditures model opens new business opportunities.
 -  Describe the basic financial and operational benefits of cloud over a traditional, off-cloud IT system.
 -  Cite real examples of businesses that have used Azure to transform their operations and improve their bottom lines.
