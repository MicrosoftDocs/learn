Let’s explore a real story of a business that transformed after switching to Microsoft Azure.

Planzer is a Swiss transportation and logistics company that was looking to upgrade its old IT infrastructure. In only seven months, Planzer was able to migrate its entire IT infrastructure – over 200 computer servers serving 69 sites—to Microsoft Azure and the cloud.

As a result, Planzer was able to:

 -  Reduce its IT costs, because it no longer needs to maintain physical equipment and spaces.
 -  Strengthen its customer-facing operations with faster communications and more reliable services.
 -  Enhance its digital operations, such as software upgrade and data backups.
 -  Explore all-new capabilities using Azure’s power and software.
