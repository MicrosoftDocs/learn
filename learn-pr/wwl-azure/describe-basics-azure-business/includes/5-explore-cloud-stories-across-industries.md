## Finance

German insurance company Munich Re used Azure to build a new set of services, the MIRA Digital Suite.

All of this is built to be compliant with protections around insurance applicants’ data.

American mortgage company Homepoint uses an Azure "data streaming” platform to constantly gather data and report key statistics to agents.
