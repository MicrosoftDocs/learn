quiz:
  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "Which one of these is a symptom of a DDoS attack?"
    choices:
    - content: "An unexplained surge in requests."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. You are not expecting that many concurrent requests that they start to overwhelm your resources."
    - content: "Application running slowly."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This could just be other performance-related issues in your application/connectivity."
    - content: "HTTP 400 Bad Request"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. HTTP 400 Bad Request response status code indicates that the server can't or won't process the request due to something that is perceived to be a client error"
  - content: "Which action shall we take when under DDoS attack?"
    choices:
    - content: "Monitor Alerts and review attack profile."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. You should look at any alerts sent out and review the attack profile (what type of attack, where is it originating, is it targeting a particular resource)."
    - content: "Scale out your Azure resources to keep systems running."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Adding more resources will only help temporarily make your services available. The attacker could just ramp up the attack to overwhelm new resources."
    - content: "Email your IT team."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Letting your IT team know is a good idea, but you need to monitor and protect your resources first."
