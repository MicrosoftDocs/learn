## Lab scenario
Being part of the Network Security team at Contoso, your next task is to create firewall rules to allow/deny access to certain websites. The following steps walk you through creating a resource group, a virtual network and subnets, and a virtual machine as environment preparation tasks, and then deploying a firewall and firewall policy, configuring default routes and application, network and DNAT rules, and finally testing the firewall.

## Objectives

- **Task 1**: Create a virtual network and subnets
- **Task 2**: Create a virtual machine
  - Use a template to create the virtual machines. You can review the [lab template](https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/AZ-700-Designing-and-Implementing-Microsoft-Azure-Networking-Solutions/blob/master/Allfiles/Exercises/M06/firewall.json).
  - Use Azure PowerShell to deploy the template. 
- **Task 3**: Deploy the firewall and firewall policy
- **Task 4**: Create a default route
- **Task 5**: Configure an application rule
- **Task 6**: Configure a network rule
- **Task 7**: Configure a Destination NAT (DNAT) rule
- **Task 8**: Change the primary and secondary DNS address for the server's network interface
- **Task 9**: Test the firewall
