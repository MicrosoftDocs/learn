In this module, you explored a range of network security features.

**The main takeaways from this module are:**

- Microsoft Defender for Cloud helps streamline the process for meeting network regulatory compliance requirements.

- Azure DDoS Protection protects resources in a virtual network. Protection includes virtual machine public IP addresses, load balancers, and application gateways. DDoS Protection can mitigate volumetric attacks, protocol attacks, and resource layer attacks. DDoS Protection offers two tiers: DDoS IP Protection, and DDoS Network Protection.

- An Network Security Group (NSG) in Azure allows you to filter network traffic to and from Azure resources in an Azure virtual network. A NSG contains default security rules that allow or deny inbound or outbound network traffic. 

- Azure Firewall is a managed, cloud-based network security service that protects your Azure virtual network resources. Azure Firewall has three SKUs: Basic, Standard, and Premium. In the Azure Firewall, you can configure NAT rules, network rules, and applications rules.

- Azure Firewall Manager provides centralized configuration and management across multiple Azure Firewall instances. Azure Firewall Manager lets you create one or more firewall policies and rapidly apply them to multiple firewalls. Firewall Manager can provide security management for secured virtual hubs and hub virtual networks. 

- Web Application Firewall provides centralized protection of your web applications from common exploits and vulnerabilities. There are two WAF policy modes: Detection and Prevention. WAF works with the Application Gateway, Azure Front Door Service, and the Azure CDN Service.
