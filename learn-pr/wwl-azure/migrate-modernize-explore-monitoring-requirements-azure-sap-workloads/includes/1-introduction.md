You're responsible for gathering the requirements that will help SAP administrators in your company prepare to monitor and troubleshoot SAP deployments on Azure. You'll need to account for the monitoring data from several Azure systems and tools. Working with the SAP administrators in your company, you'll determine any needs to consolidate monitoring data. That is, to surface Azure data (for example, Azure performance counters) into SAP systems (for example, SAP Enhanced Monitoring).

> [!NOTE]
> *Azure Monitoring Extension*, *Enhanced Monitoring*, and *Azure Extension for SAP* describe one and the same item. It describes a VM extension that needs to be deployed by you to provide some basic data about the Azure infrastructure to the SAP Host Agent. SAP Notes might refer to it as *Monitoring Extension* or *Enhanced monitoring*. In Azure, we're referring to it as *Azure Extension for SAP.*
