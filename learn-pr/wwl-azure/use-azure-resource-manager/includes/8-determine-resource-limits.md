Azure lets you view resource usage against limits. This is helpful to track current usage, and plan for future use.

 -  The limits shown are the limits for your subscription.
 -  When you need to increase a default limit, there is a Request Increase link.
 -  All resources have a maximum limit listed in Azure [limits](/azure/azure-subscription-service-limits?toc=%2fazure%2fnetworking%2ftoc.json).
 -  If you are at the maximum limit, the limit can't be increased.
