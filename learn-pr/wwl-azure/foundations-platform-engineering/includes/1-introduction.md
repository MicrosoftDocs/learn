Despite continuous efforts geared towards increasing developer productivity, building digital solutions in an optimal manner is getting increasingly complex. One of the important factors affecting this complexity is the dependency on the platform on which developers operate, including the underlying infrastructure, tools, services, and processes that drive development efforts. Optimizing this platform becomes even more challenging considering the pressure organizations place on shortening time-to-value, while, at the same time, expecting the highest levels of software quality and operational stability.

Platform engineering is meant to address these challenges. It's the practice of designing and building integrated platforms that enhance developer experience and accelerate time-to-value. By combining technologies such as infrastructure management, automation, self-service capabilities, and observability, platform engineering empowers developers to focus on delivering value without being burdened by the complexities of the underlying systems. At its core, platform engineering aligns development and operations teams, enabling the seamless delivery of applications and services while meeting business and operational goals.

With continuously growing adoption of cloud-native architectures and DevOps practices, platform engineering has become a critical discipline for any organization that aspires to derive the most value out of its internal development efforts. A well-engineered platform provides developers with the tools and processes they need to innovate faster while maintaining operational excellence. By embedding principles like scalability and resiliency, security and compliance, automation and self-service, as well as observability and continuous improvement into platform development, platform engineers create environments that aren't only developer-friendly but also robust and adaptable to changing business needs.

**"Platform Engineering streamlines development by creating tools that increase systems resiliency and enhance efficiency to accelerate value delivery."** \- According to Luiz Macedo
