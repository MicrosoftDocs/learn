<!-- 1. Topic sentences ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Goal: Orient the learner to the area covered in this module.

    Heading: None

    Example: "Good cybersecurity relies on many factors to provide confidence and assurance that your data
             is safe and being used as expected."

    Recommended: Add a visual like an image, table, or list that supports the topic sentences.

In addition to managing individual tables, the ability to join tables is a critical skill for working with relational databases. By mastering table joins, such as IINNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, FULL OUTER JOIN, and NATURAL JOIN, you can efficiently combine data from multiple tables to derive meaningful insights and streamline complex queries. This tutorial will guide you through these essential concepts, equipping you with the knowledge to handle real-world data scenarios effectively.

<!-- 2. Motivation ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Goal: Explain why the concepts that the module covers are important and how they're used. Consider
          posing a question or describing a challenging situation.

    Heading: None

    Example: "In the early years of computing systems, every application stored data in its own unique
             structure. When developers wanted to build applications to use that data, they had to know
             a lot about the data structure to find the data they needed. These structures were
             inefficient, hard to maintain, and hard to optimize for good application performance. The
             relational database model was designed to solve the problem of multiple arbitrary data
             structures. The relational model provides a standard way of representing and querying
             data that can be used by any application."

<!-- 4. Prose table of contents --------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Goal: List the activities that the learner does in this module. The prose table of contents differs
          from the title and the learning objectives. The title and the learning objectives are outcome-
          focused. They describe the skills the learner acquires as a result of consuming this content.
          In contrast, the prose table of contents states specifically what the learner **does** in order
          to acquire those skills. The format can be either prose or a bulleted list. But a list yields
          better results when transformed into other output types such as PowerPoint.

    Heading: "## What will we be doing?"

    Example: "In this module, we'll formally define several cybersecurity concepts like authentication
             and authorization. Then we'll put the concepts into context by describing some common
             authentication-based attacks. We'll also define some effective authorization security techniques."

 # What will we be doing?

In this section, we’ll learn how to combine data from multiple related tables using various types of SQL joins. You’ll understand how to use INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, FULL OUTER JOIN, and NATURAL JOIN to retrieve connected data across tables. Through practical examples using the "sales" database, you'll gain the skills to query and interpret relationships between entities like customers, orders, and employees.

 <!-- 5. Terminal learning objective ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Goal: Restate the module title as a complete sentence. You have more room here to convey the main goal
          than in a space-limited title. Make it outcome-focused so it describes the main skills and
          knowledge the learner acquires as a result of the training. Answer the question "What is the
          foundational knowledge the user gains as a result of consuming this training?"

    Heading: "## What is the main goal?"

    Example: "By the end of the module, you'll have a comprehensive understanding of core cybersecurity concepts."
 -->
## What is the main goal?

The main goal of this section is to help you master how to retrieve meaningful, connected data from multiple tables in a relational database using SQL joins. By understanding different types of joins and when to use them, you'll be able to write efficient queries that reflect real-world relationships between entities, enabling more complete and insightful data analysis.
