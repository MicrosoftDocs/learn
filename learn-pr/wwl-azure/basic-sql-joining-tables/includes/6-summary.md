This tutorial is designed to equip learners with the essential skills for retrieving related data from multiple tables using SQL JOIN operations in PostgreSQL. 
You should now be able to:

    Understand the purpose of JOINs in relational databases and how they connect data spread across normalized tables using primary and foreign keys.
    Use INNER JOIN to return only the rows that have matching values in both tables, ideal for tightly linked data.
    Apply LEFT JOIN and RIGHT JOIN to include all records from one table, even when no match exists in the other, using nulls to fill in missing data.
    Execute a FULL OUTER JOIN to get a complete dataset that includes all rows from both tables, whether they match or not.
    Utilize NATURAL JOIN to automatically join tables based on columns with the same name, while understanding the risks of unintended matches.
    Combine multiple joins in a single query to build complex, unified result sets using real-world relationships in the "sales" sample database.

These JOIN techniques are fundamental for building powerful queries and creating meaningful reports, dashboards, and data-driven applications.
