This tutorial provides a comprehensive overview of SQL JOIN operations in PostgreSQL, focusing on how to retrieve related data from multiple tables in a relational database. 
You should now be able to use various types of JOINs—including INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, FULL OUTER JOIN, and NATURAL JOIN—to combine data across normalized tables using primary and foreign keys. 
By mastering these techniques, you will be well-equipped to construct complex queries, build unified result sets, and generate meaningful insights through reports, dashboards, and data-driven applications.
