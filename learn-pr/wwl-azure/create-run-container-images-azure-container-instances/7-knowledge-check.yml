    choices:
    - content: "Azure Resource Management template"

      explanation: "Incorrect. Due to the YAML format's more concise nature, a YAML file is recommended when your deployment includes only container instances."
    - content: "YAML file"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Due to the YAML format's more concise nature, a YAML file is recommended when your deployment includes only container instances."

  - content: "What is the purpose of a restart policy in Azure Container Instances?"
    choices:
    - content: "To charge customers more for compute resources used while the container is running."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The restart policy is not related to charging customers more for compute resources."
    - content: "To ensure that containers are never restarted, even if the process fails."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The `Never` restart policy ensures that containers are run at most once, but it doesn't allow for restarting on failure."
    - content: "To specify when and how containers should be restarted, based on the desired behavior."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The restart policy allows you to specify when and how containers should be restarted, based on the desired behavior. This can help optimize resource usage and ensure that tasks are completed successfully."
  - content: "If you want to mount multiple volumes, what options are at your disposal for deployment?"
    choices:
    - content: "YAML file only"
      isCorrect: false

    - content: "Azure Resource Manager template and YAML file"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. To mount multiple volumes in a container instance, you must deploy using an Azure Resource Manager template or a YAML file."
    - content: "Azure Resource Manager template and PowerShell"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "While Azure Resource Manager templates are a viable option, you can't use PowerShell commands to directly mount multiple volumes."
