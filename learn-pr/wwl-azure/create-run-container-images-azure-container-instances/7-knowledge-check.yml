  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "When your deployment includes only container instances, which approach is recommended for deploying a multi-container group?"
    choices:
    - content: "Azure Resource Manager template"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Due to the YAML format's more concise nature, a YAML file is recommended when your deployment includes only container instances."
    - content: "YAML file"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Due to the YAML format's more concise nature, a YAML file is recommended when your deployment includes only container instances."
    - content: "Azure portal"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This module recommends using a YAML file (or a Resource Manager template) for multi-container group deployments."
  - content: "What is the purpose of a restart policy in Azure Container Instances?"
    choices:
    - content: "To charge customers more for compute resources used while the container is running."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The restart policy isn't related to charging customers more for compute resources."
    - content: "To ensure that containers are never restarted, even if the process fails."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The `Never` restart policy ensures that containers are run at most once, but it doesn't allow for restarting on failure."
    - content: "To specify when and how containers should be restarted, based on the desired behavior."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The restart policy allows you to specify when and how containers should be restarted, based on the desired behavior. This can help optimize resource usage and ensure that tasks are completed successfully."
  - content: "If you want to mount multiple volumes, what options are available for deployment?"
    choices:
    - content: "YAML file only"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "While YAML file is a viable option, you can also use Azure Resource Manager templates."
    - content: "Azure Resource Manager template and YAML file"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. To mount multiple volumes in a container instance, you must deploy using an Azure Resource Manager template or a YAML file."
    - content: "Azure portal only"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The module explains that mounting multiple volumes requires a template-based approach such as a YAML file or an Azure Resource Manager template."
  - content: "When you need to pass a secret as an environment variable in Azure Container Instances, which option is supported?"
    choices:
    - content: "Define the variable in a YAML file by using `secureValue`"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Azure Container Instances supports secure environment variables in YAML by using the `secureValue` property."
    - content: "Define the variable by using `--environment-variables` and expect the value to be visible in `az container show` output"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Secure environment variable values aren't shown in container properties output. The secure value is accessible only from within the container."
    - content: "Bake the secret into the container image and retrieve it from the file system at runtime"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Baking secrets into an image isn't a recommended approach because it increases the chance of accidental disclosure and makes rotation harder."
  - content: "Which statement about mounting an Azure Files share in Azure Container Instances is correct?"
    choices:
    - content: "You can mount Azure Files shares only to Linux containers"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Azure Container Instances supports mounting Azure Files shares only for Linux containers."
    - content: "You can mount Azure Files shares to Windows containers"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This module notes that Azure Files share mounting in Azure Container Instances is supported only for Linux containers."
    - content: "You can mount Azure Files over SMB by using managed identity"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Azure Storage doesn't support SMB mounting of an Azure file share by using managed identity in this scenario."
