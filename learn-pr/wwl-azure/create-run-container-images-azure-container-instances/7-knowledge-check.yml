    choices:
    - content: "To charge customers more for compute resources used while the container is running."
      isCorrect: false

    - content: "To ensure that containers are never restarted, even if the process fails."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The `Never` restart policy ensures that containers are run at most once, but it doesn't allow for restarting on failure."
    - content: "To specify when and how containers should be restarted, based on the desired behavior."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The restart policy allows you to specify when and how containers should be restarted, based on the desired behavior. This can help optimize resource usage and ensure that tasks are completed successfully."
