This exercise guides you through the process of consolidating duplicate logic in a C# codebase using GitHub Copilot. Tasks include:

- Review an existing C# codebase, manually identify instances of redundant/duplicate code, and test the application.
- Use GitHub Copilot's Ask mode to explain the codebase and identify redundant/duplicate code.
- Use GitHub Copilot's Agent mode to consolidate redundant/duplicate code.
- Test the refactored application to ensure functionality remains intact.
