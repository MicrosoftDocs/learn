GitHub Copilot can help developers consolidate duplicate logic in their code to improve maintainability and reduce redundancy. GitHub Copilot helps developers create cleaner, more efficient codebases by identifying repeated patterns and suggesting refactoring opportunities.

In this module, you learn how to use GitHub Copilot to identify and consolidate duplicate logic in your code. You explore techniques for recognizing code duplication patterns, extracting common functionality, and implementing DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles with AI assistance.

Imagine you're a software developer working on a large application that evolved over time. Your codebase contains multiple instances of similar logic scattered across different files and modules. You need to refactor this duplicate code to improve maintainability, reduce bugs, and make future updates easier. You decide to use GitHub Copilot to help identify these duplications and suggest consolidated solutions.
