In this module, you learned how to protect your virtual machines from unauthorized network access using Microsoft Defender for Cloud's just-in-time (JIT) virtual machine access feature. 

You explored the security risks posed by open management ports, including brute-force attacks, automated vulnerability scanning, and lateral movement threats. You learned how JIT access mitigates these risks by restricting access to management ports and only opening them when needed, for specific users, and for limited time periods.

You discovered how to enable and configure JIT access using multiple methods—through the Azure portal, PowerShell cmdlets, and REST API—on both Azure VMs and AWS EC2 instances. You also learned about the licensing requirement (Microsoft Defender for Servers Plan 2) and the permissions needed to implement JIT in your environment.

With this knowledge, you can now implement just-in-time virtual machine access as part of your organization's security strategy, reducing the attack surface of your virtual machines while maintaining necessary administrative access for legitimate users.
