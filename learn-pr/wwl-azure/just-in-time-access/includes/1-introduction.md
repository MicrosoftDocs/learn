This module covers understanding just-in-time (JIT) machine access, addressing risks of open management ports, and implementing JIT with Microsoft Defender for Cloud to enhance security in Azure and Amazon Web Services (AWS) environments.

 > [!NOTE]
 > Just-in-time machine access requires **Microsoft Defender for Servers Plan 2** to be enabled on your subscription.

## Scenario

Imagine you're responsible for securing your company's virtual machines in Azure and AWS. Using just-in-time (JIT) machine access is crucial for protecting against modern threats. Threat actors continuously scan for machines with open management ports, like RDP or SSH, using automated tools to launch brute-force attacks and infiltrate your network. By implementing JIT with Microsoft Defender for Cloud, you can lock down these ports, allowing temporary, audited access only to authorized users when needed. JIT significantly reduces the attack surface and enhances the overall security posture of your cloud environment.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this training module, participants will:

 -  Understand the risks associated with open management ports on virtual machines and how attackers exploit them.
 -  Learn how to implement JIT machine access using Microsoft Defender for Cloud (requires Defender for Servers Plan 2).
 -  Explore how JIT machine access reduces attack surfaces in Azure and AWS environments.
 -  Gain skills to configure and manage temporary, controlled, and audited access to VMs for authorized users.

## Goals

By the end of this module, you'll understand JIT machine access, and know how to implement it with Microsoft Defender for Cloud (Defender for Servers Plan 2). Use JIT to reduce attack surfaces in Azure and AWS environments, and manage temporary, audited access to virtual machines for authorized users.
