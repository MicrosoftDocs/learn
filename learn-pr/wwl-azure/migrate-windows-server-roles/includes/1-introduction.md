When you want to start using Windows Server 2022 in your organization, you might consider server roles running on existing your servers. If those existing services are running on earlier versions of Windows Server, you must know how to migrate those services. You can do so by using the Windows Server Migration Tools cmdlets.

You can use the Windows Server Migration Tools feature to sync the configuration information and data from a source server to a destination server. You use the cmdlets included in the Windows Server Migration Tools to export the configuration information and data from the source server and import the configuration on the destination server.

For supported roles and features, this is much faster than manually reconfiguring the features on the destination server. However, you must manually install the roles or features on the destination server before importing the configuration.
