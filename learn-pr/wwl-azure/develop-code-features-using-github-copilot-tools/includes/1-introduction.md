This module explores the development of new code features using the GitHub Copilot and GitHub Copilot Chat extensions for Visual Studio Code. The GitHub Copilot extension generates autocompletion suggestions as you enter code in the editor. The GitHub Copilot Chat extension generates code suggestions based on chat interactions and your codebase. By using the GitHub Copilot extensions for Visual Studio Code, you can develop code more efficiently and accurately, allowing you to focus on other aspects of your project.

Imagine you're a developer working as a software consultant. You're constantly working on new projects and new features. You spend so much of your time writing and debugging code that you don't have time to focus on other important tasks. You can't afford to miss deadlines or deliver low-quality code, so you work extra hours. You hear about GitHub Copilot, an AI-powered tool that helps developers work more efficiently and accurately. You hope that GitHub Copilot will increase your productivity and enable you to focus on more satisfying work.

The topics covered in this module include:

- Examining code development features of GitHub Copilot in Visual Studio Code.
- Examining GitHub Copilot best practices.
- Creating code by using code line completions.
- Creating code by using GitHub Copilot Inline Chat.
- Completing a "create new code" challenge and reviewing a possible solution.
- Completing a "code logic" challenge and reviewing a possible solution.
- Converting code between programming languages using GitHub Copilot.

By the end of this module, you're able to develop code more efficiently and accurately using GitHub Copilot autocompletion and chat suggestions in Visual Studio Code.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To complete this GitHub Copilot training, you must have an active subscription for GitHub Copilot in your personal GitHub account, or you must be assigned to a subscription managed by an organization or enterprise. To complete module activities, you must configure your account to allow GitHub Copilot suggestions that match public code. If you're a member of an organization on GitHub Enterprise Cloud who has been assigned a GitHub Copilot seat through your organization, the setting for suggestions matching public code will be inherited from your organization or enterprise. If your account blocks suggestions that match public code, module activities won't work as expected.
