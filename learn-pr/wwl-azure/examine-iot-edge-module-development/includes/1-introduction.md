Custom modules for Azure IoT Edge can be developed and debugged using Visual Studio, a container engine, and some specialized testing tools.

Suppose you have joined a team that is implementing an Azure IoT solution for the company. The company needs your team to develop custom solutions for IoT Edge devices using Azure IoT Edge technologies. Understanding the Azure IoT Edge development environment and coding tools will help the team develop custom solutions. You decide to examine the Azure IoT Edge development environment tools and processes.

In this module, you will:

 -  Examine the Azure IoT Edge runtime support for custom code development.
 -  Examine the IoT Edge coding tools.
 -  Examine IoT Edge coding and debugging processes.

By the end of this module, you will be able to describe the tools that can be used to develop and test custom Azure IoT Edge modules.
