As an educator, you play a pivotal role in empowering students for future success. Skilling our future generations is critical work. With the increasing demand for everyone to become more technically skilled the AZ-900: Microsoft Azure Fundamentals course aims to be accessible to everyone and anyone. This may be your students' first introduction to the cloud and this course serves as a foundation for some of our more advanced courses. 

Before we begin, make sure you're using the most up-to-date version of the Microsoft Official Curriculum. It's recommended that you log into the [Learning Download Center](https://aka.ms/ldc) (LDC) at least quarterly. If you haven't already done so, please download the course materials from the LDC before continuing with this module. 
 
Now that you have the updated materials, you’re ready to prepare for your class.
