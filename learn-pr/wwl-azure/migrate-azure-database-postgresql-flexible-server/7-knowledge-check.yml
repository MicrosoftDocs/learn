  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "A PostgreSQL database server at version 11.22 needs an online migration to Azure Database for PostgreSQL - Flexible Server running PostgreSQL version 14. Which tools or services can be used to perform this migration?"
    choices:
    - content: "Azure Database for PostgreSQL Flexible Server Migration."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Currently DMS is the only option to provide an Online migration option, the Flexible Server Migration option is for offline migrations."
    - content: "pg_dump and pg_restore."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Using these native tools mean you need to perform an offline migration as it doesn't sync changes."
    - content: "Database Migration Service."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. DMS Provides the facility for an Online database migration for PostgreSQL databases."
  - content: "An offline migration is being performed from an existing PostgreSQL server to Azure Database for PostgreSQL - Flexible Server. To transfer server-level roles from the source to the target, which combination of tools should be used?"
    choices:
    - content: "pg_dumpall, psql, and Azure Database for PostgreSQL - Flexible Server Migration."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The process is to first transfer server scoped objects such as roles, then use the Migration feature within **PostgreSQL Flexible Server** to move the schema and data."
    - content: "pg_dump and pg_restore."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While this can be used to migrate a database, it's missing the pg_dumpall process."
    - content: "psql and Database Migration Service."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. DMS doesn't provide an offline migration option for PostgreSQL databases."
  - content: "Before performing a database migration from a source PostgreSQL server to a target, it's necessary to assess whether there are any blockers. Which tool should be used for this assessment?"
    choices:
    - content: "Database Migration Service."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. DMS migrates databases but doesn't provide an assessment capability."
    - content: "pg_dumpall."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This is used to export server config and databases to a file."
    - content: "Azure Data Studio with Azure PostgreSQL migration extension."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. There's a dedicated extension in ADS, which allows you to generate a rich report on potential migration blockers for PostgreSQL databases."
