        In 2015, the Federal Government's CFO Act empowered the Department of Homeland Security and Office of Management and Budget to identify the government's most critical assets, which it deemed high value assets (HVA), and mitigate risk.

        In 2017, the OMB formally created the High Value Asset Program through [Memorandum M-19-03](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/M-19-03.pdf), with the intent of providing clarification and guidance toward protecting HVAs.

        The memorandum begins that it seeks to expand its support to all agencies in the identification, assessment, remediation, and response to incidents.

        The memorandum requires agencies to:

        - Designate an integrated agency-level office, team, or structure to enable incorporation of HVA activities
        - Establish, evaluate, and update HVA information sharing agreements

### Improving the designations of HVAs

The memorandum notes that an HVA does not have a single definition, but instead may be defined as an asset that falls into one or more of three categories:

- The asset has high informational value to the Government or its adversaries
- The asset is mission essential, and an agency cannot accomplish its mission without the information or system
- The asset is essential to the federal civilian enterprise, or is critical to the security and resilience

It should be noted that agencies may designate HVAs, but if OMB and DHS recognize an asset as an HVA, they may do so as well.

### Implementing data-driven HVA prioritization

The memorandum also notes that the identification of HVAs and prioritization of their safekeeping must be done through data-driven decision making. It also notes that:

- Agencies must adopt DHS' methodology for prioritizing HVAs and their activities
- Provide feedback to DHS on whether the methodology and its output are effective

### Increasing the trustworthiness of HVAs

An information system may be compromised by compromising its security, or promising the trustworthiness of the data it stores. As such, agencies are required to:

- Implement the guidance put forth in NIST Special Publication 800-160 [*Volume 1, Systems Security Engineering: Considerations for a Multidisciplinary Approach in the Engineering of Trustworthy Secure Systems*](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-160v1.pdf) for all HVAs
- Ensure security and privacy requirements have been implemented into HVA architectures
- Ensure procurement of information systems that support HVAs meet all security and privacy requirements 

### Protecting privacy and HVAs

The memorandum adds no additional privacy requirements for HVAs, but re-iterates that Senior Agency Officials for Privacy must meet the same PII requirements for HVAs set for in the OMB Circular A-130. 

### Defining HVA reporting, assessment, and remediation requirements

The memorandum notes that agencies are required to:

- Report their HVAs to DHS
- Assess their HVAs at a frequency determined by DHS as part of their existing cybersecurity programs
- Maintain a Rules of Engagement authorization with DHS
- Provide the results of HVA assessments to DHS
- Incorporate the requirements to enable HVA assessments into future contracts and service level agreements (SLAs)
- Develop remediation plans to address assement findings
- Work with the budget office to ensure there is funding to address cybersecurity requirements for HVAs
- For those findings that an agency will not remediate, provide a letter to OMB and DHS indicating why and the acceptance of risk. 

### Government-wide responsibilities

The memorandum also notes a number of activities for which DHS and GSA are responsible.

## Importance

This memorandum is of specific importance because it clarifies the importance of high value assets, and sets requirements around how they may be identified, and what must be undertaken to ensure they are protected. It also sets very specific responsibilities to all agencies, and demonstrates how DHS, the OMB, and GSA will support the program.
