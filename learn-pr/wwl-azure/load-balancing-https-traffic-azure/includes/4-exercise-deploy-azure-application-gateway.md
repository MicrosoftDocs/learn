## Objectives

 -  **Task 1**: Create an application gateway
 -  **Task 2**: Add backend targets
    - Use a template to create the virtual machines. You can review the [lab template](https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/AZ-700-Designing-and-Implementing-Microsoft-Azure-Networking-Solutions/blob/master/Allfiles/Exercises/M05/backend.json).
    - Use Azure PowerShell to deploy the template. 
 -  **Task 3**: Add backend servers to backend pool
 -  **Task 4**: Test the application gateway
