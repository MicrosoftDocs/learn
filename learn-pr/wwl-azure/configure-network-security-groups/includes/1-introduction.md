Network security groups are a way to limit network traffic to resources in your virtual network. Network security groups contain a list of security rules that allow or deny inbound or outbound network traffic.

Suppose your company has several locations and wants to migrate to a cloud based solution. The company only considers moving key systems onto the cloud platform if stringent security requirements can be met. These requirements include tight control over which computers have network access to the app servers. You need to secure both virtual machine networking and Azure services networking. Your goal is to prevent unwanted or unsecured network traffic from being able to reach key systems.

In this module, you learn how to create a network security group, configure inbound and outbound port rules, and verify secure connectivity.

The goal of this module is to teach you how to control network traffic with network security groups. 

## Learning objectives

In this module, you learn how to:

- Determine when to use network security groups.
