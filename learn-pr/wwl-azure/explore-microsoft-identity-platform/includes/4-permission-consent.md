Applications that integrate with the Microsoft identity platform follow an authorization model that gives users and administrators control over how data can be accessed.

The Microsoft identity platform implements the [OAuth 2.0](/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-v2-protocols) authorization protocol. OAuth 2.0 is a method through which a third-party app can access web-hosted resources on behalf of a user. Any web-hosted resource that integrates with the Microsoft identity platform has a resource identifier, or *application ID URI*.

Here are some examples of Microsoft web-hosted resources:

* Microsoft Graph: `https://graph.microsoft.com`
* Microsoft 365 Mail API: `https://outlook.office.com`
* Azure Key Vault: `https://vault.azure.net`

The same is true for any third-party resources that have integrated with the Microsoft identity platform. Any of these resources also can define a set of permissions that can be used to divide the functionality of that resource into smaller chunks. When a resource's functionality is chunked into small permission sets, third-party apps can be built to request only the permissions that they need to perform their function. Users and administrators can know what data the app can access.

In OAuth 2.0, these types of permission sets are called *scopes*. They're also often referred to as *permissions*. In the Microsoft identity platform, a permission is represented as a string value. An app requests the permissions it needs by specifying the permission in the `scope` query parameter. Identity platform supports several well-defined [OpenID Connect scopes](/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-permissions-and-consent#openid-connect-scopes) and resource-based permissions (each permission is indicated by appending the permission value to the resource's identifier or application ID URI). For example, the permission string `https://graph.microsoft.com/Calendars.Read` is used to request permission to read users calendars in Microsoft Graph.

An app most commonly requests these permissions by specifying the scopes in requests to the Microsoft identity platform authorize endpoint. However, some high-privilege permissions can be granted only through administrator consent. They can be requested or granted by using the [administrator consent endpoint](/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-permissions-and-consent#admin-restricted-permissions).

> [!NOTE]
> In requests to the authorization, token or consent endpoints for the Microsoft Identity platform, if the resource identifier is omitted in the scope parameter, the resource is assumed to be Microsoft Graph. For example, `scope=User.Read` is equivalent to `https://graph.microsoft.com/User.Read`.

## Permission types

The Microsoft identity platform supports two types of permissions: *delegated permissions* and *app-only access*.

* **Delegated permissions** are used by apps that have a signed-in user present. For these apps, either the user or an administrator consents to the permissions that the app requests. The app is delegated with the permission to act as a signed-in user when it makes calls to the target resource.

* **App-only access permissions** are used by apps that run without a signed-in user present, for example, apps that run as background services or daemons. Only an administrator can consent to app-only access permissions.

## Consent types

Applications in Microsoft identity platform rely on consent in order to gain access to necessary resources or APIs. There are many kinds of consent that your app may need to know about in order to be successful. If you're defining permissions, you'll also need to understand how your users gain access to your app or API.

There are three consent types: *static user consent*, *incremental and dynamic user consent*, and *admin consent*.

### Static user consent

In the static user consent scenario, you must specify all the permissions it needs in the app's configuration in the Azure portal. If the user (or administrator, as appropriate) hasn't granted consent for this app, then Microsoft identity platform prompts the user to provide consent at this time. Static permissions also enable administrators to consent on behalf of all users in the organization.

While static permissions of the app defined in the Azure portal keep the code nice and simple, it presents some possible issues for developers:

* The app needs to request all the permissions it would ever need upon the user's first sign-in. This can lead to a long list of permissions that discourages end users from approving the app's access on initial sign-in. 

* The app needs to know all of the resources it would ever access ahead of time. It's difficult to create apps that could access an arbitrary number of resources.

### Incremental and dynamic user consent

With the Microsoft identity platform endpoint, you can ignore the static permissions defined in the app registration information in the Azure portal and request permissions incrementally instead.  You can ask for a minimum set of permissions upfront and request more over time as the customer uses more app features. 

To do so, you can specify the scopes your app needs at any time by including the new scopes in the `scope` parameter when requesting an access token - without the need to predefine them in the application registration information. If the user hasn't yet consented to new scopes added to the request, they're prompted to consent only to the new permissions. Incremental, or dynamic consent, only applies to delegated permissions and not to app-only access permissions.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Dynamic consent can be convenient, but presents a big challenge for permissions that require admin consent, since the admin consent experience doesn't know about those permissions at consent time. If you require admin privileged permissions or if your app uses dynamic consent, you must register all of the permissions in the Azure portal (not just the subset of permissions that require admin consent). This enables tenant admins to consent on behalf of all their users.

### Admin consent

Admin consent is required when your app needs access to certain high-privilege permissions. Admin consent ensures that administrators have some other controls before authorizing apps or users to access highly privileged data from the organization.

Admin consent done on behalf of an organization still requires the static permissions registered for the app. Set those permissions for apps in the app registration portal if you need an admin to give consent on behalf of the entire organization. This reduces the cycles required by the organization admin to set up the application.

## Requesting individual user consent

In an OpenID Connect or OAuth 2.0 authorization request, an app can request the permissions it needs by using the scope query parameter. For example, when a user signs in to an app, the app sends a request like the following example. Line breaks are added for legibility.

```http
GET https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/v2.0/authorize?
client_id=6731de76-14a6-49ae-97bc-6eba6914391e
&response_type=code
&redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%2Fmyapp%2F
&response_mode=query
&scope=
https%3A%2F%2Fgraph.microsoft.com%2Fcalendars.read%20
https%3A%2F%2Fgraph.microsoft.com%2Fmail.send
&state=12345
```

The `scope` parameter is a space-separated list of delegated permissions that the app is requesting. Each permission is indicated by appending the permission value to the resource's identifier (the application ID URI). In the request example, the app needs permission to read the user's calendar and send mail as the user.

After the user enters their credentials, the Microsoft identity platform checks for a matching record of *user consent*. If the user hasn't consented to any of the requested permissions in the past, and if the administrator hasn't consented to these permissions on behalf of the entire organization, the Microsoft identity platform asks the user to grant the requested permissions.
