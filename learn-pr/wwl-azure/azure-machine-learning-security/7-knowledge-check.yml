  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "What does creating Custom Roles allow you to do?"
    choices:
    - content: "Custom roles allow you to customize what users can and can’t access in a workspace"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. By creating custom roles, you can make a role available for specific tasks by using actions and NotActions to give and restrict access."
    - content: "Custom roles allow you to **only** perform read-only actions in a workspace"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The **reader** role can only perform read-only actions. Using custom roles, you can set restrictions on certain workspaces so a user can be a contributor for one space and a reader for another."
    - content: "Custom roles allow you to customize the speaking voice used"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. There's no voice to customize."
  - content: "What would you use the Azure Key Vault for?"
    choices:
    - content: "To keep track of your house, work, and car keys"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Azure Key Vault isn't for your literal keys, but for electronic keys (such as passwords) that provide access to resources."
    - content: "To hide your training models and data"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. That is what virtual private network’s (VPN) are used for."
    - content: "To securely store and access secrets"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. A secret is anything that you want to tightly control access to, such as API keys, passwords, certificates, or cryptographic key."
  - content: "Why use a virtual private network (VPN) for machine learning?"
    choices:
    - content: "To assign roles"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Assigning roles is part of Azure Machine Learning workspaces."
    - content: "To secure your training models and data from malicious actors by encrypting your connection"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. VPNs such as point-to-site, site-to-site, or Azure ExpressRoute encrypt your internet connection or don’t go over the internet at all, limiting access to your resources."
    - content: "To work offline"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. VPNs are used to secure your data and encrypt your IP address—only Azure ExpressRoute doesn’t send your traffic over the internet."
