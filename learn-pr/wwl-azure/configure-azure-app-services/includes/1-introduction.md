Azure Administrators are interested in solutions that make it easier to deploy and manage their web, mobile, and API applications.

Your company provides consumer research, and your team manages the on-premises servers. The servers you administer run the entire company infrastructure from web servers to databases. The hardware is aging and starting to struggle to keep up with some of the new data analysis applications. Rather than upgrade the hardware, the company decided to deploy Azure App Service.
