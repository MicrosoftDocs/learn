### App Service benefits

There are many advantages to using App Service to develop and deploy your web, mobile, and API apps. Review the following table and think about what features can help you host your App Service instances.

| Benefit | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Multiple languages and frameworks** | App Service has first-class support for ASP.NET, Java, Node.js, PHP, and Python. You can also run PowerShell and other scripts or executables as background services. |
| **DevOps optimization** | App Service supports continuous integration and deployment with Azure DevOps, GitHub, BitBucket, Docker Hub, and Azure Container Registry. You can promote updates through test and staging environments. Manage your apps in App Service by using Azure PowerShell or the cross-platform command-line interface (CLI). |
| **Global scale with high availability** | App Service helps you scale up or out manually or automatically. You can host your apps anywhere within the Microsoft global datacenter infrastructure, and the App Service SLA offers high availability. |
| **Connections to SaaS platforms and on-premises data** | App Service lets you choose from more than 50 connectors for enterprise systems (such as SAP), SaaS services (such as Salesforce), and internet services (such as Facebook). You can access on-premises data by using Hybrid Connections and Azure Virtual Networks. |
| **Security and compliance** | App Service is ISO, SOC, and PCI compliant. You can authenticate users with Microsoft Entra ID or with social logins via Google, Facebook, Twitter, or Microsoft. Create IP address restrictions and manage service identities. |
| **Application templates** | Choose from an extensive list of application templates in Azure Marketplace, such as WordPress, Joomla, and Drupal.
| **Visual Studio integration** | App Service offers dedicated tools in Visual Studio to help streamline the work of creating, deploying, and debugging. |
| **API and mobile features** | App Service provides turn-key CORS support for RESTful API scenarios. You can simplify your mobile app scenarios by enabling authentication, offline data sync, push notifications, and more. |
| **Serverless code** | App Service lets you run a code snippet or script on-demand without having to explicitly provision or manage infrastructure. You pay only for the compute time your code actually uses. |
