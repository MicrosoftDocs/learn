### Things to know about customer-managed keys

Consider the following characteristics of customer-managed keys.

- By creating your own keys (referred to as _customer-managed_ keys), you have more flexibility and greater control.

- You can create, disable, audit, rotate, and define access controls for your encryption keys.

- Customer-managed keys can be used with Azure Storage encryption. You can use a new key or an existing key vault and key. The Azure storage account and the key vault must be in the same region, but they can be in different subscriptions.

## Configure customer-managed keys

In the Azure portal, you can configure customer-managed encryption keys. You can create your own keys, or you can have the keys managed by Microsoft. Consider how you might use Azure Key Vault to create your own customer-managed encryption keys.
