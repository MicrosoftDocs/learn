  title: ""
  questions:
  - content: "Which solution is the easiest way to implement secure storage for the company's media files?"
    choices:
    - content: "Create a shared access signature (SAS) for each user and delete the SAS to prevent access."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Creating a SAS for each user involves a great amount of administrative overhead. Is there an easier alternative?"
    - content: "Create stored access policies for each container to enable revocation of access or change of duration."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The SAS changes access based on permissions or duration by replacing the stored access policy with a new one, or by deleting the stored access policy altogether to revoke access."
    - content: "Periodically regenerate the account key to control access to the files."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Regenerating keys prevents all users from accessing all files at the same time."
  - content: "What's the default network rule when configuring network access to an Azure storage account?"
    choices:
    - content: "Allow all connections from all networks."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The default network rule is to allow all connections from all networks."
    - content: "Allow all connection from a private IP address range."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. By default, the IP address isn't considered."
    - content: "Deny all connections from all networks."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. All connections aren't denied by default."
  - content: "What's the best way to implement secure access to Azure Storage for the company's users?"
    choices:
    - content: "Use shared access signatures for the production applications."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A SAS isn't the best solution for the production applications."
    - content: "Use access keys for the production applications."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Access keys provide unrestricted access to the storage resources, which is the requirement for production applications in this scenario."
    - content: "Use stored access policies for the production applications."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Stored access policies aren't the best solution for the production applications."
