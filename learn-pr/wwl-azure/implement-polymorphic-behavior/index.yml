title: Implement polymorphic behavior
summary: Learn the principles of polymorphism, how to implement polymorphic behavior by using either class inheritance or interface implementation, and how to choose between inheritance-based and interface-based&nbsp;approaches to polymorphism.
abstract: |
  -   Describe the principles of polymorphism.

  -   Implement inheritance-based polymorphism.

  -   Implement interface-based polymorphism.

  -   Explain polymorphic design considerations.

  -   Implement polymorphic behavior in a C# application.
prerequisites: |
  -   An installation of Visual Studio Code with the C# Dev Kit extension installed.

  -   The ability to develop basic object-oriented program in C# that implement classes with properties and methods.

  -   The ability to create interfaces&nbsp;that define a contract&nbsp;for the classes implemented by a basic&nbsp;object-oriented program written in C#.

  -   The ability to create a class hierarchy by using base and derived classes.
