In this module, you learned about polymorphism, a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming that allows objects of different types to be treated as objects of a common base type. You examined the principles of polymorphism and explored the implementation of both inheritance-based and interface-based polymorphism. The module also covered the benefits of polymorphism and design considerations for implementing polymorphic behavior in C#.

The main takeaways from this module include understanding the benefits of polymorphism such as code reusability, flexibility, maintainability, and extensibility. You learned about inheritance-based polymorphism in C#, where objects are created from derived classes and treated as objects of the base class. You also learned interface-based polymorphism, which allows classes to implement contracts defined by interfaces, enabling polymorphic behavior without class inheritance. Lastly, you learned about the considerations for polymorphic design, focusing on inheritance-based and interface-based polymorphism.
