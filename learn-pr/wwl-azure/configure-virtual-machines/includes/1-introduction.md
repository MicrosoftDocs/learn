## Scenario

Suppose you work for a company doing consumer research and you're responsible for managing the on-premises servers. The servers you administer run all the company infrastructure, from web servers to databases. However, the hardware is aging and starting to struggle to keep up with some of the new data analysis applications being deployed to it. Rather than upgrade the hardware, the company has decided to deploy Azure virtual machines.

You are responsible for deploying the new virtual machines. Your deployment tasks will include correctly sizing the machines, selecting storage, and configuring networking.
