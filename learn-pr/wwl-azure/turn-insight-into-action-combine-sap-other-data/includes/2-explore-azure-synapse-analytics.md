## When to use Azure Synapse Analytics

Synapse enables four main types of analytics:

- Descriptive, or historical analytics helps you answer the question 'What is happening in my business?'
- Diagnostic analytics helps you answer the question 'Why is it happening?'
- Predictive analytics helps you answer the question 'What is likely to happen in the future based on previous trends and patterns?'
- Prescriptive analytics helps you identify actions based on real-time or near real-time analysis of data.

Synapse allows you to work with all four types of analytics but also integrates with Azure Machine Learning for more complex predictions.

With Azure Synapse, you can perform most activities required for your business scenario from a single workspace--Synapse Studio. Connect to multiple data sources, ingest data from those sources, and apply analytics and machine learning on the data.
