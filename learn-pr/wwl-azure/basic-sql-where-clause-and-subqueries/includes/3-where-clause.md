The `WHERE` clause in PostgreSQL is used to filter rows in a query based on specified conditions, enabling the retrieval of just the data that meets your needs. 

It is a powerful filtering tool with a wide range of options, allowing users to combine conditions, apply logical operators, and format outputs to meet complex query requirements. 

## Filtering based on a single condition

```sql
SELECT produt_name, price, unit 
FROM sales.products 
WHERE price > 50;
```

This query retrieves products with a `price` greater than 50.

## Filtering based on multiple conditions(AND, OR)

```sql
SELECT customer_name, country, city, NOW() AS query_time 
FROM sales.customers 
WHERE country = 'Germany' 
AND city = 'Berlin';
```

This query retrieves customers from Germany who reside in Berlin and projects a calculated column which is given the name `query_time`, and its value is produced by the intrinsic function `NOW()`.

Intrinsic functions are built-in functions provided by the database system to perform specific operations, such as mathematical calculations, string manipulation, or retrieving system-generated values. In this example, `NOW()` is used to fetch the exact date and time the query was executed, enhancing insights into when the data was retrieved. Some other examples of intrinsic functions are `CURRENT_DATE`, which returns the current date, and `LENGTH()`, which calculates the length of a given string. 

```sql
SELECT product_name, category_id, CAST(price AS VARCHAR) as price_text 
FROM sales.products 
WHERE category_id = 1 
OR category_id = 8;
```
This query selects products belonging to either category 1 (Beverages) or category 8 (Seafood). Additionally, the `CAST` function is used to convert the `price` column into text format, presenting it as `price_text` in the results. 

## Filtering based on multiple conditions (IN, NOT IN)

```sql
SELECT product_name, category_id, CAST(price as VARCHAR) as price_text 
FROM sales.products 
WHERE category_id IN (1,8); 
```

This query produces the same result as the previous query, but it uses the `IN` clause instead of `OR`. The `IN` clause filters records by checking if a column matches any value within a specified list. 

```sql
SELECT customer_name, country 
FROM sales.customers 
WHERE country NOT IN ('USA');
```

This query finds customers not based in USA.

```sql
SELECT order_id, order_date, EXTRACT(MONTH FROM order_date) AS order_month 
FROM sales.orders 
WHERE EXTRACT(MONTH FROM order_date) = 1;
```

This query retrieves orders made in January by using the `EXTRACT` function to isolate the month from the `order_date` column and display it as `order_month`. 

## Using LIKE for pattern matching

```sql
SELECT customer_name, address 
FROM sales.customers 
WHERE customer_name LIKE 'A%';
```
This query retrieves customers whose names start with 'A'. The symbol `%` in the string literal is a wildcard used by the `LIKE` operator for pattern matching. It represents zero or more characters, allowing the query to match any `customer_name` that begins with the letter 'A' followed by any sequence of characters. For instance, names like "Alice" or "Andrew" would be included in the query results. 


```sql
SELECT product_id, product_name 
FROM sales.products 
WHERE product_name LIKE '%Chocolate%';
```

This query retrieves products whose names contain the word "Chocolate". When placed before and after the word "Chocolate" in the query, it allows for matches where "Chocolate" appears anywhere in the product name—whether at the beginning, middle, or end. For instance, product names such as "Teatime Chocolate Biscuits," or "Chocolate” would be included in the query results.  

## Using IN and NOT IN for multiple values

```sql
SELECT customer_name AS full_name 
FROM sales.customers 
WHERE country IN ('Germany', 'France', 'UK');
```

This query retrieves a list of customers whose `country` is specified as either Germany, France, or the UK. By using the SQL operator `IN`, the query checks the country column for matches against the specified set of values ('Germany', 'France', 'UK'). If the value in the country column corresponds to any of these three options, the corresponding customer names are returned and displayed under the alias `full_name`. 

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM sales.products 
WHERE category_id NOT IN (1, 3);
```

This query retrieves products that are not classified under categories 1 or 3.

## Using BETWEEN for range values

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM sales.products 
WHERE price BETWEEN 20 and 40;
```

This query retrieves products priced between 20 and 40 currency units, inclusive.

The `BETWEEN` statement in SQL is used to filter the data within a specified range of values. It is inclusive, meaning it includes the boundary values given in the range. This is particularly useful for narrowing down datasets based on numerical, date, or even text values (if applicable). It provides a concise and readable way to define a range, as opposed to using multiple conditional operators like `>=` and `<=`. 

## Using IS NULL and IS NOT NULL for null values

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM sales.customers 
WHERE postal_code IS NULL;
```

This query retrieves customers with a missing `postal_code`.

In SQL, `NULL` represents missing or undefined data in a database. 
It is not equivalent to zero, an empty string, or any other type of value, but rather indicates the absence of a value. 
To handle `NULL`, you can use filters such as `IS NULL` to identify records with missing values or `IS NOT NULL` to find entries with determined data. 
These filters are particularly useful in cleansing data, as they help segregate records for correction, exclusion, or specialized treatment.
