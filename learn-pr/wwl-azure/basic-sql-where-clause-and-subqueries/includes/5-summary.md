This tutorial provides a practical foundation for filtering and retrieving data in PostgreSQL using the WHERE clause and Subqueries. You should now be able to:

    Filter data effectively using the WHERE clause, leveraging a range of conditions including comparison operators, logical operators (AND, OR), pattern matching with LIKE, range filtering with BETWEEN, value lists with IN and NOT IN, and null checks using IS NULL / IS NOT NULL.
    Combine multiple conditions and apply built-in PostgreSQL functions such as EXTRACT, NOW(), and CAST to tailor your result sets for analytical or operational needs.
    Write dynamic queries that extract only the relevant rows based on complex filtering logic using real-world examples from the "Sales" database.
    Use Subqueries to build layered queries that allow one SELECT statement to feed data into another, enabling more flexible and advanced query logic.
    Incorporate subqueries within SELECT, FROM, and WHERE clauses, or even within data manipulation statements like UPDATE, to filter, aggregate, or transform data based on the results of other queries.
    Understand the structure and behavior of subqueriesâ€”including the use of parentheses, how results from a subquery influence the outer query, and performance considerations when nesting queries.
    Apply these techniques to tasks like identifying customers who have made purchases, products above average price, category-specific updates, or supplier-based aggregations.
    By mastering these filtering and subquery techniques, you are well-equipped to handle a wide variety of data retrieval and manipulation tasks in PostgreSQL, enabling precise and powerful data exploration.
