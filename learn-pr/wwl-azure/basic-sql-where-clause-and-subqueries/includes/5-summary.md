This tutorial provides a practical foundation for filtering and retrieving data in PostgreSQL using the WHERE clause and subqueries. 
You should now be able to apply various filtering techniques with comparison, logical, and pattern-matching operators; use built-in functions like EXTRACT, NOW(), and CAST; and write subqueries to create layered and dynamic queries. 
By mastering these concepts, you're equipped to perform precise data selection and complex manipulations for real-world scenarios in PostgreSQL.
