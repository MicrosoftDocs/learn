    choices:
    - content: "Pretriggers are automatically executed for each database operation."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Triggers aren't automatically executed. They must be specified for each database operation where you want them to execute."
    - content: "Pretriggers are executed before modifying a database item and must be specified for each database operation where you want them to execute."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Pretriggers in Azure Cosmos DB are executed before modifying a database item and they need to be specified for each database operation where they should execute."
    - content: "Pretriggers are used to execute operations after modifying a database item."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Pretriggers are executed before modifying a database item, not after."

    choices:
    - content: "It stores the data from which the change feed is generated."

    - content: "It processes the change feed across multiple workers."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The lease container does not process the change feed, it coordinates the processing across multiple workers."
    - content: "It acts as a state storage and coordinates processing the change feed across multiple workers."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The lease container acts as a state storage and coordinates processing the change feed across multiple workers."
