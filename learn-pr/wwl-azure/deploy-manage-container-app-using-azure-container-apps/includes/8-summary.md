Your goal was to demonstrate that using Container Apps to manage app deployments and revisions meets Fabrikam's business requirements.

By configuring your deployment resources and by using Container Apps to manage scaling and revisions, you demonstrated a solution that improved your ability to publish and run containerized apps at scale.

Having the ability to implement the scaling and revision management capabilities enabled by Container Apps while also reducing the complexity of your devops implementation is a big win for Fabrikam.
