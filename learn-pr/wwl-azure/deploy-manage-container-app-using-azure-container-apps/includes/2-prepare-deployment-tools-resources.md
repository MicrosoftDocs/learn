In this guided project, you configure Azure resources and other tools to demonstrate the suitability of Azure Container Apps as a deployment option.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> An Azure subscription and GitHub account are required for this guided project. For your Azure subscription, we recommend that you have the Owner, Azure account administrator, or Azure co-administrator role. The Contributor role does not provide the permissions required to complete all tasks in this guided project module.

## Project overview

You work on a devops team for a technology company named Fabrikam Inc. The team is looking into using Azure Container Apps to run containerized cloud-native apps. Fabrikam has been using Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) to run containers. Although the team is obtaining the benefits of running apps as containers and from using Kubernetes as a host, they've discovered that they're not using advanced AKS features. For example, they're not using the custom service mesh or autoscaling features. The team believes they can both simplify and improve efficiency of their devops implementation by switching to Azure Container Apps. The team believes that switching to Azure Container Apps will:

- Improve their ability to publish and run containerized apps at scale.
- Reduce the complexity of their current devops implementation.
- Save resources by using scale-to-zero and built-in autoscaling capabilities.

You have been tasked with developing a proof-of-concept solution. The solution must demonstrate the team's ability to:

1. Configure a secure connection between Azure Container Registry and Azure Container Apps.
1. Create and configure a container app in Azure Container Apps.
1. Configure continuous integration by using Azure Pipelines.
1. Scale a deployed app in Azure Container Apps.
1. Manage revisions in Azure Container Apps.

Your goal for this module is to implement a solution that demonstrates the deployment of cloud-native apps using Azure Container Apps. To achieve this goal, you complete the following activities:

1. Set up the host environment and deployment resources.
1. Configure Azure Container Registry for a secure connection with Azure Container Apps.
1. Create and configure a container app in Azure Container Apps.
1. Configure continuous integration using an Azure pipeline.
1. Configure traffic-splitting and revision management.
