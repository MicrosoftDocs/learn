Welcome to the **Use GitHub to manage files** guided project. During this project, you'll have a chance to work with GitHub and Visual Studio Code while using the git command line. In this module, you'll practice how to:

 -  Create a GitHub account and an initial repository.
 -  Configure software to interact with GitHub.
 -  Use software to create a local version of your repository.
 -  Update files locally, and then update the web-based repository.
 -  Resolve conflicts in your repository.
 -  Merge all updates to a single repository branch.
