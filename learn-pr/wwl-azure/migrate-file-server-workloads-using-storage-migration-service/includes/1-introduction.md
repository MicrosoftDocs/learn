You can use Storage Migration Service to migrate files and file shares from existing file servers to new servers running Windows Server 2022 and Windows Server 2019. If you choose to move the identity from the source server to the destination server, the client connectivity to the shares is preserved during the migration. Before you create a job that identifies how the migration will be performed, configure an orchestrator server to manage the migration process. In the job, specify which volumes and shares you need to migrate.
