From Enterprise Subscriptions to Free Trial Accounts to Pay-as-You-Go options, you can purchase Azure based on your company needs and business goals. You can even have different subscriptions for different parts of your business.

Contoso Shipping is just getting started, and should start thinking early about how they want to subscribe to Azure. Does the marketing team need their own subscription?  It would be great to give the development group a dev/test subscription to keep their choices in cloud components wide open, while limiting their costs.  Maybe we should set up centralized billing to track the over spend.

In this module, we will discuss the types of offerings that are available, how to pay for the offerings, and the best methods for choosing the right offerings for your needs.
