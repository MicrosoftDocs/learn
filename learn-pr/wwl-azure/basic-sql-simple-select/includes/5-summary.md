# Summary

This tutorial provides a foundational understanding of how to use the SELECT statement in PostgreSQL to retrieve and manipulate data effectively. By the end of this tutorial, you should be able to:

- Select all columns or specific columns from a table to retrieve relevant data.
- Use the DISTINCT keyword to eliminate duplicate values in query results.
- Create calculated columns by performing arithmetic operations or applying functions to existing data.
- Concatenate columns or values to combine data into a single output.

These skills will enable you to write efficient and meaningful queries to extract and present data in a structured and insightful manner.
