title: Implement spec-driven development using the GitHub Spec Kit
summary: "Implement the spec-driven development methodology using GitHub Spec Kit and GitHub Copilot in Visual Studio Code. Training covers a brownfield scenario for enterprise developers, emphasizing intent-first philosophy with living specifications."
abstract: |
  By the end of this module, you're able to:
    - Explain spec-driven development methodology and why it benefits large-scale enterprise projects (upfront clarity, fewer regressions, easier maintenance).
    - Implement the GitHub Spec Kit and GitHub Copilot in Visual Studio Code to generate project artifacts (specifications, plans, tasks) aligned with enterprise development standards.
    - Apply the GitHub Spec Kit in an Azure-integrated scenario, encoding internal engineering guidelines (security, performance, compliance) in a project "Constitution" and ensuring generated plans adhere to these constraints.
    - Execute a spec-driven workflow to build a new feature, from spec creation through automated code generation and iteration.
    - Describe how to integrate GitHub Spec Kit into team workflows, how to use it alongside Azure DevOps/GitHub Enterprise, and how to extend it for advanced scenarios (such as multi-agent collaboration and CI/CD integration).
prerequisites: |
  - Experience using GitHub Copilot in Visual Studio Code.
  - Experience developing applications.
  - General understanding of spec-driven development is recommended.
  - Familiarity with GitHub Spec Kit is recommended.
