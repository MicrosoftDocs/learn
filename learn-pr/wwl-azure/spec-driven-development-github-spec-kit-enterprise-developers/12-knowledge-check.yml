  questions:
  - content: "What is the primary problem that spec-driven development (SDD) solves when working with AI coding assistants?"
    choices:
    - content: "AI models generate code too slowly for modern development timelines."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. AI code generation speed isn't the primary concern that SDD addresses."
    - content: "Context fragmentation across conversations leads to inconsistent implementations."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. SDD addresses context fragmentation by capturing requirements, decisions, and constraints in persistent artifacts that AI can reference consistently across conversations."
    - content: "AI coding assistants can't generate front-end code effectively."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. AI assistants are capable of generating front-end code. SDD addresses structural and consistency issues, not capability limitations."
  - content: "Which of the following best describes a core principle of spec-driven development (SDD)?"
    choices:
    - content: "Implementation code should be written before creating specifications."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. SDD follows a documentation-first approach where specifications are created before implementation."
    - content: "Specifications should serve as the single source of truth that guides AI-generated implementations."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. In SDD, the specification acts as the single source of truth that ensures consistent implementations across conversations and team members."
    - content: "AI models should generate specifications automatically from existing code."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. SDD creates specifications before implementation, not derived from existing code."
  - content: "What are the three main capabilities provided by GitHub Spec Kit?"
    choices:
    - content: "Code generation, automated testing, and deployment automation."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While GitHub Spec Kit guides AI code generation, its core capabilities focus on artifact creation, workflow standardization, and reusable commands."
    - content: "Persistent markdown artifacts, standardized workflow phases, and reusable slash commands."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. GitHub Spec Kit provides persistent artifacts (constitution.md, spec.md, plan.md, tasks.md), standardized workflow phases, and reusable /speckit.* slash commands for consistent development."
    - content: "Database management, API documentation, and continuous integration."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. These items are application development concerns, not the core capabilities that GitHub Spec Kit provides."
  - content: "Which command initializes a new project with the GitHub Spec Kit structure?"
    choices:
    - content: "specify start"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. 'specify start' isn't a valid Specify CLI command."
    - content: "specify check"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. 'specify check' verifies that required tools are installed, but doesn't initialize a new project."
    - content: "specify init"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The 'specify init' command creates the project structure for spec-driven development, including prompt templates and artifact files."
  - content: "What is the primary purpose of the constitution.md file in spec-driven development?"
    choices:
    - content: "To provide step-by-step implementation instructions for developers."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Implementation instructions come from the tasks.md file. The constitution defines principles and guardrails."
    - content: "To establish guardrails and principles that guide AI-generated implementations."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The constitution file defines technology standards, security requirements, performance guidelines, and coding standards that ensure consistent, compliant implementations."
    - content: "To track completed features and project milestones."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Project tracking isn't the purpose of the constitution. It establishes principles and constraints."
  - content: "Which sections are typically included in a well-structured constitution.md file?"
    choices:
    - content: "User stories, acceptance criteria, and test cases."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. These sections belong in the specification file, not the constitution."
    - content: "Technology standards, security requirements, performance guidelines, and coding standards."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The constitution includes technology standards, security requirements, performance/scalability guidelines, and coding standards that govern all project development."
    - content: "Database schemas, API endpoints, and deployment instructions."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. These items represent implementation details that appear in plans and tasks, not constitutional principles."
  - content: "What is the relationship between spec.md and plan.md in the spec-driven development (SDD) workflow?"
    choices:
    - content: "The spec defines what to build; the plan defines how to build it."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The specification remains stable and focuses on requirements (what), while the plan can evolve with different implementation approaches (how)."
    - content: "The spec and plan are two names for the same file."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The spec.md and plan.md files are distinct files with different purposes in the SDD workflow."
    - content: "The plan provides user requirements; the spec provides technical architecture."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This relationship is reversed. The spec contains requirements, and the plan contains technical architecture."
  - content: "Which slash command generates a technical plan from an existing specification?"
    choices:
    - content: "/speckit.constitution"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This command helps create the constitution file, not the technical plan."
    - content: "/speckit.plan"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The /speckit.plan command uses both spec.md and constitution.md as inputs to generate a comprehensive technical design in plan.md."
    - content: "/speckit.implement"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. /speckit.implement generates code based on tasks, not the technical plan itself."
  - content: "What is the primary purpose of the tasks.md file in GitHub Spec Kit?"
    choices:
    - content: "To convert high-level architectural decisions into specific, actionable work items."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The tasks.md file transforms the technical plan into discrete, implementable units of work that can be executed, tested, and verified independently."
    - content: "To document completed features for stakeholder reporting."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While tasks track progress, their primary purpose is to provide actionable implementation steps, not stakeholder reporting."
    - content: "To replace the specification with implementation-focused requirements."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Tasks complement the specification and plan; they don't replace them."
  - content: "How should tasks be organized in a well-structured tasks.md file for complex features?"
    choices:
    - content: "Alphabetically by task name for easy reference."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Tasks should be organized logically using dependencies and implementation sequence, not alphabetically."
    - content: "In phases that group related tasks and create natural milestones."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Phase-based organization groups related tasks (for example, Foundation, Core Functionality, Front end, Security, Testing) and creates clear milestones for tracking progress."
    - content: "By estimated completion time from shortest to longest."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Tasks should be organized using logical dependencies and implementation sequence, not by duration."
  - content: "Which tool is recommended for installing and managing the Specify CLI?"
    choices:
    - content: "npm (Node Package Manager)"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. npm is for Node.js packages, not Python tools like Specify CLI."
    - content: "uv package manager"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The uv tool is the recommended package manager for installing and managing the Specify CLI, providing persistent installation and version management."
    - content: "pip (Python Package Installer)"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While pip works with Python, uv is the recommended tool for Specify CLI installation."
  - content: "What is a key benefit of maintaining spec-driven development (SDD) artifacts in version control for team collaboration?"
    choices:
    - content: "Artifacts become shared sources of truth accessible to all team members regardless of location."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Version-controlled SDD artifacts provide shared understanding of requirements, consistent architectural decisions, and coordinated implementation approaches for distributed teams."
    - content: "Version control automatically generates code from specifications."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Version control stores artifacts but doesn't generate code. AI assistants generate code based on the artifacts."
    - content: "Development teams no longer need to write documentation separately."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While SDD artifacts serve as documentation, these documents don't eliminate all documentation needs, and improved documentation isn't the primary team collaboration benefit."
  - content: "How should teams maintain consistency in their constitution.md file?"
    choices:
    - content: "Allow any developer to modify the constitution as needed during implementation."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Unilateral constitution changes lead to inconsistency. Changes should be deliberate and team-approved."
    - content: "Designate constitution maintainers who review and approve changes through team consensus."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Specific team members (typically senior developers or architects) should maintain the constitution, reviewing proposed changes and ensuring new principles don't conflict with existing ones through team consensus."
    - content: "Lock the constitution file after initial creation to prevent any modifications."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The constitution should evolve as team standards change, but through deliberate, approved processes, not locked permanently."
  - content: "What is a key advantage of integrating specification validation into CI/CD pipelines?"
    choices:
    - content: "It automatically generates missing features based on incomplete specifications."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. CI/CD validation checks for alignment and completeness, but doesn't automatically generate features."
    - content: "It ensures specifications remain synchronized with production code throughout the software lifecycle."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Automated specification validation in CI/CD pipelines verifies that implementations match specifications, catches incomplete implementations, and prevents specification-code drift before changes reach production."
    - content: "It eliminates the need for manual code reviews."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Specification validation complements but doesn't replace manual code reviews."
  - content: "Which of the following items is an example of automating constitution compliance in a CI/CD pipeline?"
    choices:
    - content: "Running unit tests to verify code functionality."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Unit tests verify functionality, not constitution compliance. Constitution checks validate adherence to architectural principles and standards."
    - content: "Scanning Infrastructure as Code files to verify only approved cloud resources are used."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. If the constitution states 'All cloud resources must use Azure services,' automated checks can scan IaC files to verify no unapproved cloud providers are used, preventing constitutional violations."
    - content: "Measuring code coverage percentages."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Code coverage is a quality metric, not a constitution compliance check."
