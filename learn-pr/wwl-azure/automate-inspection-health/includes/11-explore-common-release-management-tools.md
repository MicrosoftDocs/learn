The following tools are mainstream in the current ecosystem. You'll find links to the product websites to explore the product and see if it fits the needs we described in the previous chapter.

 -  What Artifacts and Artifact sources does the tool support?
 -  What Triggers and Schedules?
 -  Does the tool support Approvals and gates?
 -  Can you define multiple stages?
 -  How do the Build and Release Tasks work?
 -  How does the tool deal with Traceability, Auditability, and Security?
 -  What is the Extensibility model?

Per tool is indicated if it's part of a more extensive suite. Integration with a bigger suite gives you many advantages regarding traceability, security, and auditability. Numerous integrations are already there out of the box.

## GitHub Actions

GitHub Actions help you build, test, and deploy your code. You can implement continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) that allows you to make code reviews, branch management, and issue triaging work the way you want.

 -  Trigger workflows with various events.
 -  Configure environments to set rules before a job can proceed and to limit access to secrets.
 -  Use concurrency to control the number of deployments running at a time.

## GitLab Pipelines

GitLab helps teams automate the release and delivery of their applications to shorten the delivery lifecycle, streamline manual processes and accelerate team velocity.

With Continuous Delivery (CD) built into the pipeline, deployment can be automated to multiple environments like staging and production and support advanced features such as canary deployments.

Because the configuration and definition of the application are version controlled and managed, it's easy to configure and deploy your application on demand.
