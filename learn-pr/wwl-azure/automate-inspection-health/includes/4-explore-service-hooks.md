Service hooks enable you to do tasks on other services when your Azure DevOps Services projects happen.

For example, create a card in Trello when a work item is created.

Or send a push notification to your team's mobile devices when a build fails.

Service hooks can also be used in custom apps and services.

It's a more efficient way to drive activities when events happen in your projects.

Azure DevOps includes built-in support for the following Service Hooks:

| **Build and release.** | **Collaborate** | **Customer support** | **Plan and track** | **Integrate**     |
| ---------------------- | --------------- | -------------------- | ------------------ | ----------------- |
| AppVeyor               | Campfire        | UserVoice            | Trello             | Azure Service Bus |

| Jenkins                | HipChat         |                      |                    | Web Hooks         |
| MyGet                  | Hubot           |                      |                    | Zapier            |
| Slack                  |                 |                      |                    |                   |

This list will change over time.
