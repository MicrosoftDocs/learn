Welcome to this interactive skills validation experience. Completing this module helps you prepare for the Administer Active Directory Domain Services assessment.

This module covers the major steps of deploying, configuring, and maintaining a domain controller. It provides an opportunity to promote a domain controller in a virtualized environment using a Windows 10 or Windows 11 machine.

## Scenario

Imagine you are a system administrator for a mid-sized company that is expanding its network infrastructure. You have been tasked with setting up a new domain controller to manage user access and security. However, due to budget constraints, you need to use existing hardware running Windows 10 or Windows 11. This scenario will guide you through the process of configuring a virtualized environment on your machine to run two Windows Server 2022 Evaluation Edition virtual machines.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you'll practice how to:

 -  Configure Domain Controller Operations.
 -  Configure User Management Operations.
 -  Manage Password Policies.
 -  Configure Security Settings.

By the end of this module, you gain hands-on experience in configuring an Active Directory Domain Services domain controller.
