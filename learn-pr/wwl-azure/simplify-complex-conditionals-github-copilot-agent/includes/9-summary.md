In this module, you learned how to identify, analyze, and refactor complex conditional statements using GitHub Copilot's Ask and Agent modes. You explored the problems associated with deeply nested conditionals and implemented systematic approaches to transform complex logic into clean, maintainable code.

The main takeaway from this module is the ability to leverage GitHub Copilot's powerful capabilities to tackle one of the most challenging aspects of code maintenance: complex conditional logic. You learned how complex conditionals evolve over time and the problems they create for code readability, maintenance, and testing. You explored proven refactoring techniques such as guard clauses, extracting methods, and reducing nesting levels. Most importantly, you discovered how to use GitHub Copilot's Ask mode to analyze and understand existing code patterns, and how to use Agent mode to systematically refactor complex conditionals into simpler, more maintainable structures. These skills enable you to confidently approach legacy codebases and transform tangled logic into clean, readable code.

You can apply the knowledge gained in this module to improve code quality in any C# project, reduce technical debt, and make your codebase more maintainable for your team. By mastering these refactoring techniques with GitHub Copilot, you can enhance your productivity as a developer and contribute to creating more robust, testable software systems.
