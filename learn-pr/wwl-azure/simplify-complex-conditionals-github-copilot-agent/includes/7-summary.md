<!-- 1. Restate the scenario problem --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Goal: Summarize the challenge(s) posed in the introduction scenario; be brief (1-2 sentences)

    Heading: none

    Example: "You are writing the instruction manual for a new model fire extinguisher. The instructions must be quickly read and understood by a wide variety of people."

<!-- 2. Show how you solved the scenario problem(s)---------------------------------------------------

    Goal: Describe how you used the product to solve the problem(s) posed in the introduction scenario

    Heading: none; depending on length, you can put this in a separate paragraph or combine this with the previous section into a single paragraph

    Recommended: format this as lead-in sentence(s) followed by a list

    Example: "You did some research and found that Plain English is a good writing style for safety-critical communications. You applied several Plain English techniques to your instructions:
        * Removed unnecessary words, which made your sentences easier to read even in a stressful situation like a fire.
        * Made sure all sentences used the active voice, which made your content more direct.
        * Replaced fire-industry jargon with everyday words, which made the instructions accessible to a wider audience.
        * Replaced a comma-delimited list with a bulleted list, which made the steps to activate the fire extinguisher easier to follow."

<!-- 3. Describe the experience without the product ---------------------------------------------------

    Goal: Describe what would be required to solve the problem without using the product; be brief (1-2 sentences)

    Heading: none; typically this will be a new paragraph

    Example: "Fire extinguishers are critical safety equipment for both homes and businesses. Despite their importance, many customers don't read the instructions ahead of time. Confusing instructions could mean customers don't use the extinguisher correctly when they're needed. This can result in loss of property or life."

TODO: describe the experience without the product

<!-- 4. Describe the business impact ----------------------------------------------------

    Goal: explain the business impact of using the product to solve the problem

    Heading: none; depending on length, you can put this in a separate paragraph or combine this with the previous section into a single paragraph

    Example: "The test for effective instructions is whether customers can use your extinguishers correctly during an emergency. Users that fail might blame the instructions or the product. In either case, it's not good for business. On the other hand, successful customers are likely to share their stories and become advocates for your product."

<!-- 5. References (optional) ----------------------------------------------------

    Goal: Provide a few recommendations for further study via a bulleted list of links. This is optional and intended to be used sparingly.        
        - use descriptive link text so you don't need to include other text such as a description
        - prefer other first-party sites like Docs reference pages
        - generally avoid linking to other Learn training content ("next steps" recommendations are generated automatically)
        - link to third-party sites only when they are trusted and authoritative
        - avoid linking to opinion sites such as blog posts

    Heading: "## References"

    Example:
        "## References
