Complex conditional statements are a common challenge in software development. Over time, business logic can evolve into deeply nested if-else statements and intricate decision trees that become increasingly difficult to read, maintain, and test. GitHub Copilot Agent provides powerful capabilities to help developers identify, analyze, and refactor complex conditional logic, transforming tangled code into clean, maintainable solutions.

Imagine you're a software developer who inherits a legacy codebase with deeply nested conditional statements that handle complex business rules. The code works, but it's difficult to understand and modify. With GitHub Copilot's Ask and Agent modes, you can analyze the existing logic, understand its intent, and systematically refactor it into more readable and maintainable code structures.

The topics covered in this module include:

- Understanding the impact and problems associated with complex conditional statements.
- Examining the characteristics that make conditional logic complex and difficult to maintain.
- Exploring techniques and best practices for simplifying complex conditionals.
- Using GitHub Copilot's Ask mode to analyze and understand complex logic patterns.
- Using GitHub Copilot's Agent mode to refactor complex conditionals into cleaner code.

After completing this module, you'll be able to:

- Describe how complex conditionals evolve over time and the problems associated with complex and deeply nested conditional code.
- Describe the tools, techniques, and processes used to refactor complex and deeply nested conditional code.
- Use GitHub Copilot's Ask mode to explain a codebase and identify opportunities to simplify complex and deeply nested conditional code.
- Use GitHub Copilot's Agent mode to refactor complex and deeply nested conditional code.

> To complete this GitHub Copilot training, you must have an active subscription for GitHub Copilot in your personal GitHub account (includes the GitHub Copilot Free plan), or you must be assigned to a subscription managed by an organization or enterprise. Module activities might include GitHub Copilot suggestions that match public code. If you're a member of an organization on GitHub Enterprise Cloud and a GitHub Copilot subscription is assigned to you through your organization, the setting for suggestions matching public code might be inherited from your organization or enterprise. If your account blocks suggestions that match public code, module activities might not work as expected.
