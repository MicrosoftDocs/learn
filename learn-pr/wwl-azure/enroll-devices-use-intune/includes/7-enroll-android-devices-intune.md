You can let users enroll their personal devices for Intune management (BYOD). Once you've completed the prerequisites and assigned users licenses, they can download the Intune Company Portal app from the Google Play Store, and follow enrollment instructions in the app.

To enroll an Android device using the Company Portal, perform the following steps:

1.  Install the free Intune Company Portal app from Google Play.
2.  Open the Company Portal app.
3.  On the Company Portal Welcome screen, tap **Sign in**, and then sign in with your work or school account.
4.  Follow the instructions given in the Company Portal. The end-user experience can vary based on the policies assigned to the user and/or device.

#### Android Enterprise

Android Enterprise management makes it easier to define the scope of management for a particular device. This is helpful in balancing what information is managed by IT and what is managed by the device user or owner.

**Android Enterprise work profile**. Intune helps you deploy apps and settings to Android work profile devices to ensure work and personal information are separate. After enrollment, management capabilities only affect the work profile that is created on the device during enrollment. Users can install any app they choose to the personal side of the device. Administrators can manage and monitor apps and actions scoped to the work profile. Note that Android work profiles are supported on only certain Android devices.

 -  **Android Enterprise dedicated.** For corporate-owned, single use devices, such as digital signage, ticket printing, or inventory management. Admins lock down the usage of a device for a limited set of apps and web links. It also prevents users from adding other apps or taking other actions on the device.
 -  **Android Enterprise fully managed.** For corporate-owned, single user devices used exclusively for work and not personal use. Admins can manage the entire device and enforce policy controls unavailable to work profiles.

To set up Android Enterprise, you must connect your Intune tenant account to your Managed Google Play account and set up an enrollment profile based on what method of management is being used.
