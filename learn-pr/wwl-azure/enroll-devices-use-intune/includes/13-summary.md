Intune allows for the easy management of Windows, Android, and iOS devices using the Microsoft Intune admin center. The Intune Company Portal is accessible across multiple platforms and is used to self-manage device enrollment and to access applications published by administrators. Mobile device management is an industry standard for managing mobile devices, such as smart phones, tablets, laptops, and desktop computers and can be used in place of more traditional management methods such as Group Policies.

Intune supports various mobile devices and computers, which can be restricted or allowed, by defining allowed devices. With the use of security policy in Microsoft 365 or a Conditional Access policy in Intune, administrators can restrict access to company resources and apps only to users that are Intune enrolled. Users company-owned devices can be set up for the automatic enrollment into Intune in addition to giving users the option to enroll their personal devices for Intune management (BYOD). The device enrollment manager account provides an easy way to prepare and configure multiple enrolled devices at once.
