Data sets have unique lifecycles. Early in the lifecycle, people access some data often. But the need for access drops drastically as the data ages. Some data stays idle in the cloud and is rarely accessed once stored.

After completing this module, you'll be able to:

* Describe how each of the access tiers is optimized.
* Create and implement a lifecycle policy. 
* Rehydrate blob data stored in an archive tier.
