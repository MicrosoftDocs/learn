In this module, you learned about default implementations in interfaces, their benefits, and how to define them. You also learned how to use interfaces as method parameters, implement system-defined interfaces, and create flexible and reusable code. Additionally, you explored a practical scenario where you designed and implemented various types of lights with different functionalities using interfaces in C#.

After completing this module, you're now able to:

- Define and use default implementations in interfaces.
- Understand the benefits of default implementations, including code reuse, backward compatibility, and flexibility.
- Use interfaces as method parameters to promote loose coupling and enhance testability.
- Implement common system-defined interfaces such as `IComparable`, `IEnumerable`, and `IDisposable`.
- Override default implementations in specific classes to provide custom behavior.
