Default implementations in interfaces enable you to add new methods directly into an interface and provide a default implementation. A class that uses this interface can either use the default method or override and provide its own implementation.

Imagine you're a software developer at a tech company building a home automation system. Your task is to design and implement various types of lights with different functionalities using interfaces in C#. Using interfaces allows the system to be flexible and easily extendable as new types of lights and features are added.

After completing this module, youâ€™ll be able to:

- Define and implement basic interfaces in C#.
- Implement default methods in interfaces.
- Use interfaces as method parameters to promote loose coupling.
- Implement and use common system-defined interfaces like IEnumerable, IDisposable, and IComparable.
- Override default implementations in specific classes.

## Prerequisites

- Visual Studio Code installed with the C# Dev Kit.
- Basic knowledge of the Visual Studio Code IDE.
- Basic understanding of the C# programming language.
- Able to create and implement basic interfaces.
- Familiar with classes, abstract classes, and inheritance.
