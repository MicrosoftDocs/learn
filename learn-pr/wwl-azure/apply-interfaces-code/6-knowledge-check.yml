  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "What is a key benefit of using default implementations in interfaces?"
    choices:
    - content: "They allow for code reuse across different implementations."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Default implementations enable sharing common functions across different classes without copying code, promoting code reuse."
    - content: "They automatically apply to all classes without any need for implementation."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Classes must still implement the interface and can choose to use or override the default methods."
    - content: "They prevent any changes to the interface once defined."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Default implementations actually allow adding new methods to interfaces without breaking existing implementations."
  - content: "What is the purpose of the IDisposable interface in C#?"
    choices:
    - content: "To release unmanaged resources."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The IDisposable interface is used to release unmanaged resources, such as file handles and network connections."
    - content: "To compare objects."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The IComparable interface is used for comparing objects, not releasing unmanaged resources."
    - content: "To iterate over collections."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The IEnumerable interface is used for iterating over collections, not releasing unmanaged resources."
  - content: "What is the main advantage of using system-defined interfaces like IEnumerable and IDisposable in C#?"
    choices:
    - content: "They provide standard methods that ensure consistent behavior across different types."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. System-defined interfaces provide standard methods that can be implemented across different types, ensuring uniformity and predictability in behavior."
    - content: "They allow for the automatic generation of code."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. System-defined interfaces do not automatically generate code; they provide standard methods for consistent behavior."
    - content: "They prevent the need for any implementation in classes."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Classes implementing system-defined interfaces must still provide implementations for the interface methods."
