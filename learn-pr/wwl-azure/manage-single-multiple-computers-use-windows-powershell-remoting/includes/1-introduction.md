You can run commands on one or hundreds of computers with a single PowerShell command. PowerShell supports remote computing by using various technologies, including Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI), remote procedure call (RPC), and Web Services for Management (WS-Management, or *WS-MAN*). Windows PowerShell remoting uses the WS-Management protocol to let you run any Windows PowerShell command on one or more remote computers. For example, you can establish persistent connections, start interactive sessions, and run scripts on remote computers. Although remoting is a complex technology, after you understand the underlying concepts working with Windows PowerShell remoting is fairly straightforward. In this module, you'll learn how to use remoting to perform administration on remote computers.
