Think of security in layers, and the network layer is important.  You need to lock down the network with tools like security groups, Bastion, and Front Door. When, a bad-actor has to invest time and effort to break into your network or gain access to resources if they break in the more likely they are to leave you alone.

## Scenario

A security engineer uses network security features to restrict, monitor, and manage network traffic once it reaches your Azure network; you will work on such tasks as:
- Setup network security groups and application security groups.
- Deploy Service Endpoints and Private Links.
- Configure Front Door and ExpressRoute.

## Skills measured

Azure Active Directory is a part of [Exam AZ-500: Microsoft Azure Security Engineer](/learn/certifications/exams/az-500).

Implement platform protection (15-20%)
- Implement advanced network security
   - secure the connectivity of virtual networks (VPN authentication, Express Route encryption)
   - configure Network Security Groups (NSGs) and Application Security Groups (ASGs)
   - configure Azure Front Door service as an Application Gateway
   - configure a Web Application Firewall (WAF) on Azure Application Gateway
   - implement Service Endpoints

## Learning objectives

In this module, you will:

- Deploy and configure network security groups to protect your Azure solutions
- Configure and lockdown service endpoints and private links
- Secure your applications with Application Gateway, Web App Firewall, and Front Door
- Configure ExpressRoute to help protect your network traffic
