      explanation: "Incorrect. Seasonal data is not concerned with how far apart values are."
    - content: "Data occurring at regular intervals."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Seasonal times series is considered to be a pattern in your data that occurs at regular intervals. Examples would be hourly, daily, or monthly patterns."
  - content: "What is the purpose of specifying granularity in your JSON data object?"

    - content: "It is used to indicate the range of acceptable values."
      isCorrect: false

  - content: "How does Azure AI Anomaly Detector evaluate real-time data for anomalies?"
    choices:
    - content: "It collects all the values in a window of time and evaluates them all at once."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This is an example of batch processing, not real-time."
    - content: "It evaluates the current value against the previous value."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. It evaluates previously seen data points to determine if your latest one is an anomaly."
    - content: "It uses interpolation based on the current value and the previous value to predict what the expected value should be."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. It does not use interpolation to evaluate an expected value."
