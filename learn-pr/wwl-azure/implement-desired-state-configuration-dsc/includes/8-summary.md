This module described **Desired State Configuration (DSC)** and its components for implementation with **Azure Automation**. You learned how to manage configuration drift, create DSC configurations, implement DSC for **Linux** environments, and plan for hybrid management.

## Learning objectives summary

You learned how to:

- **Understand configuration drift:** Identify how infrastructure configurations change over time, the concept of snowflake configurations, and the security implications of configuration drift.
- **Implement Desired State Configuration (DSC):** Use **PowerShell DSC** with configurations, resources, and **Local Configuration Manager (LCM)** to define and enforce desired states.
- **Describe Azure Automation State Configuration:** Use **Azure Automation** as a centralized **DSC pull server** with built-in management, compilation, and monitoring capabilities.
- **Create DSC configuration files:** Write **PowerShell** scripts with configuration blocks, node blocks, and resource blocks to define infrastructure state.
- **Implement DSC for Linux:** Apply **DSC** to **Linux** environments on **Azure** using **DSC for Linux** resources and **Azure Automation State Configuration**.
- **Plan for hybrid management:** Manage both **Azure** and on-premises resources with **DSC** for consistent configuration across hybrid environments.
