quiz:
  questions:
    - content: "What is the primary difference between centralized and distributed version control systems?"
      choices:
        - content: "In centralized systems, there's a single, centralized instance of the repository containing the full history of the project. In distributed systems, each team member would typically have one, fully functional local copy of the entire repository, potentially including its full version history."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct. This is the primary difference between centralized and distributed version control systems."
        - content: "Distributed systems require developers to check out files from a centralized instance of the repository before making modifications and committing changes."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. In distributed systems, developers make and commit changes to their local copy of the repository, which, at some point later, are synchronized with other copies."
        - content: "Centralized systems require network connectivity to perform all activities, while distributed systems don't. "
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. Centralized systems require network connectivity for some actions, but not all."
    - content: "What is the shift-left approach in security?"
      choices:
        - content: "Introducing security activities as late in the software lifecycle processes as possible. "
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. This approach means introducing security activities as early as possible in the software lifecycle processes."
        - content: "Introducing security activities only during the testing phase of software development. "
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. This approach means introducing security activities as early as possible in the software lifecycle processes, starting with incorporating security in software design."
        - content: "Introducing security activities as early in the software lifecycle processes as possible. "
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct. The shift-left approach in security means introducing security activities as early as possible in the software lifecycle processes, starting with incorporating security in software design."
    - content: "What is the purpose of continuous integration?"
      choices:
        - content: "To submit changes directly to the main branch without review."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. Changes are subject to a collective review before being merged into the main branch."
        - content: "To automatically, build and test updated versions of software following individual updates to the software repository."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct. Continuous integration involves automating the build and testing process following individual updates to the software repository."
        - content: "To manually, build and test updated versions of software."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. Continuous integration involves automating the build and testing process."
