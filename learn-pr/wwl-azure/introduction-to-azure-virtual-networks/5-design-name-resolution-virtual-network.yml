quiz:
  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "What is the difference between a static public IP address and a dynamic public IP address?"
    choices:
    - content: "A dynamic IP address remains the same over the lifespan of the resource."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A dynamic public IP address is an assigned address that can change over the lifespan of the Azure resource. The dynamic IP address is allocated when you create or start a VM."
    - content: "A static IP address can use an IPv4 address only."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Static IP addresses are created with either an IPv4 or an IPv6 address."
    - content: "A static IP address remains the same over the lifespan of the resource."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. A static public IP address is an assigned address that won't change over the lifespan of the Azure resource. To configure a static IP address, set the allocation method explicitly to static."
  - content: "Application owners need to use dynamic IP addresses for specific resources on their VNet. Which SKU must they choose?"
    choices:
    - content: "Basic SKU"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Basic SKU public IPs can be assigned by using static or dynamic allocation methods."
    - content: "Standard SKU"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Standard SKU public IP addresses always use the static allocation method."
    - content: "Either Basic or Standard SKU"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Standard SKU public IP addresses always use the static allocation method. Basic SKU public IPs can be assigned by using static or dynamic allocation methods."
