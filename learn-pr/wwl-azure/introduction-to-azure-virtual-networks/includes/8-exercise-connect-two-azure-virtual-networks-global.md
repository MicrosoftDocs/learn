## Lab scenario

In this lab, you configure connectivity between the CoreServicesVnet and the ManufacturingVnet by adding peerings to allow traffic flow.

## Objectives

- **Task 1**: Deploy the infrastructure.  
  - Use a template to create the virtual machines. You can review the [lab template](https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/AZ-700-Designing-and-Implementing-Microsoft-Azure-Networking-Solutions/blob/master/Allfiles/Exercises/M01/ManufacturingVMazuredeploy.json).
  - Use Azure PowerShell to deploy the template.
- **Task 2**: Use RDP to connect to the test virtual machines. 
- **Task 3**: Test the connection between the virtual machines. 
- **Task 4**: Create VNet peerings.
- **Task 5**: Retest the connection between the virtual machines.
