[Azure Virtual Networks (VNets)](/azure/virtual-network/virtual-networks-overview) are the fundamental building block of your private network in Azure. VNets enable you to build complex virtual networks that are similar to an on-premises network, with other benefits of Azure infrastructure such as scale, availability, and isolation.

This video reviews the basics of IP addressing and subnetting.

## Capabilities of Azure Virtual Networks

Azure VNets enable resources in Azure to securely communicate with each other, the internet, and on-premises networks.

- **Communication with the internet.** All resources in a VNet can communicate outbound to the internet, by default. You can communicate inbound to a resource by assigning a public IP address or a public Load Balancer. You can also use public IP or public Load Balancer to manage your outbound connections.
- **Communication between Azure resources.** There are three key mechanisms through which Azure resource can communicate: VNets, VNet service endpoints, and VNet peering. Virtual Networks can connect not only virtual machines (VMs), but other Azure Resources, such as the App Service Environment, Azure Kubernetes Service, and Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets. You can use service endpoints to connect to other Azure resource types, such as Azure SQL databases and storage accounts. When you create a VNet, your services and VMs within your VNet can communicate directly and securely with each other in the cloud.
- **Communication between on-premises resources.** Securely extend your data center. You can connect your on-premises computers and networks to a virtual network using any of the following options: Point-to-site virtual private network (VPN), Site-to-site VPN, Azure ExpressRoute.
- **Filtering network traffic.** You can filter network traffic between subnets using any combination of network security groups and network virtual appliances.  
- **Routing network traffic.** Azure routes traffic between subnets, connected virtual networks, on-premises networks, and the Internet, by default. You can implement route tables or border gateway protocol (BGP) routes to override the default routes Azure creates.

## Design considerations for Azure Virtual Networks

### Address space and subnets

You can create multiple virtual networks per region per subscription. You can create multiple subnets within each virtual network.

**Virtual Networks**

When you're creating a VNet, use address ranges enumerated in RFC 1918. These addresses are for private, nonroutable address spaces.

- 10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255 (10/8 prefix)
- 172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255 (172.16/12 prefix)
- 192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255 (192.168/16 prefix)

In addition, these address ranges are reserved.

- 224.0.0.0/4 (Multicast)
- 255.255.255.255/32 (Broadcast)
- 127.0.0.0/8 (Loopback)
- 169.254.0.0/16 (Link-local)
- 168.63.129.16/32 (Internal DNS)

**Subnets**

A subnet is a range of IP address in the VNet. You segment VNets into different size subnets. You then deploy Azure resources in a specific subnet. Just like in a traditional network, subnets allow you to segment your VNet address space into segments that are appropriate for the organization's internal network. The smallest supported IPv4 subnet is /29, and the largest is /2 (using CIDR subnet definitions). IPv6 subnets must be exactly /64 in size. When planning to implement subnets, consider:

- Each subnet must have a unique address range, specified in Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) format.
- Certain Azure services require their own subnet.
- Subnets can be used for traffic management. For example, you can create subnets to route traffic through a network virtual appliance.
- You can limit access to Azure resources to specific subnets with a virtual network service endpoint. You can create multiple subnets, and enable a service endpoint for some subnets, but not others.

**Considerations for virtual networks**

When planning to implement virtual networks, you need to consider:

- Ensure nonoverlapping address spaces. Make sure your VNet address space (CIDR block) doesn't overlap with your organization's other network ranges.
- Is any security isolation required?
- Do you need to mitigate any IP addressing limitations?
- Are there connections between Azure VNets and on-premises networks?
- Is there any isolation required for administrative purposes?
- Are you using any Azure services that create their own VNets?
