    choices:
    - content: "User-defined routes (UDR)"

      explanation: "Incorrect. There is a better solution."
    - content: "View the effective routes for each NIC. (UDR)"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. You can use Azure portal, Azure CLI, or Azure PowerShell to view the Effective Routes for each NIC."
    - content: "Use forced tunneling to control traffic flow."
