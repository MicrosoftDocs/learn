Managed identities offer a secure method for controlling access to Azure resources. Azure handles these identities automatically, allowing you to verify access to services compatible with Azure AD authentication. This means don't need to embed credentials into your code, enhancing security. In Azure DevOps, managed identities can authenticate Azure resources within your self-hosted agents, simplifying access control without compromising security.

In this lab, create a managed identity to use in your YAML pipelines using Azure DevOps with self-hosted agents and a managed identity.
