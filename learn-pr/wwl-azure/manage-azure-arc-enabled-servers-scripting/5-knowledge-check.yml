  questions:
  - content: "A system administrator needs to install the Connected Machine agent on multiple remote machines simultaneously. Which command should they run?"
    choices:
    - content: "New PSSession ComputerName myMachineName1, myMachineName2 Connect AzConnectedMachine ResourceGroupName myResourceGroup Location region PSSession sessions."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This command is missing the third machine name in the list."
    - content: "New PSSession ComputerName myMachineName Connect AzConnectedMachine ResourceGroupName myResourceGroup Location region PSSession sessions."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This command is used for installing the agent on a single machine, not multiple machines."
    - content: "New PSSession ComputerName myMachineName1, myMachineName2, myMachineName3 Connect AzConnectedMachine ResourceGroupName myResourceGroup Location region PSSession sessions."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. This command installs the agent on multiple machines by specifying each machine name separated by a comma."
  - content: "A system administrator is tasked with installing the Connected Machine Agent to a collection of devices using a script. After completing the installation, how can the administrator verify a successful connection to Azure Arc?"
    choices:
    - content: "By running a diagnostic test on the network."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A network diagnostic test doesn't confirm the connection to Azure Arc."
    - content: "By checking the status of the devices in the device manager."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The device manager doesn't provide information about the connection to Azure Arc."
    - content: "By monitoring the script status and checking the visibility of onboarded servers in the Azure portal."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The script status monitoring indicates if the script has successfully installed the Connected Machine Agent. Onboarded servers will also be visible in the Azure portal."
  - content: "An administrator in a large IT company needs to manage both Windows and Linux machines efficiently, ensuring they're all connected to Azure Arc. What solution can automate the process, reducing the risk of errors?"

    - content: "Using a manual method for each machine."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Manual methods are time consuming and prone to errors."
    - content: "Automating the process of enabling Azure Arc for Windows or Linux machines."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Automating the process ensures all machines are correctly configured and connected to Azure Arc."
