In this module, you learned about cmdlets used to configure settings related to Group Policy, Server Manager, Hyper-V, and Internet Information Services (IIS). The following are the key takeaways:

- The Group Policy management cmdlets that are part of the **GroupPolicy** module can automate the management of most tasks involving Group Policy Objects (GPOs), including creating, deleting, backing up, reporting, and importing GPOs. Their names include the prefix **GP** while most have **GPO** as the noun.
- The **ServerManager** module for PowerShell contains cmdlets for managing server features, roles, and services. These cmdlet names include the noun **WindowsFeature**. These cmdlets can only be targeted against and run on Windows Server operating systems and not on a Windows client-based operating system.
- The **Hyper-V** module for PowerShell offers more than 200 cmdlets for managing Hyper-V Virtual machines (VMs), virtual hard disks, and other components of a Hyper-V environment.
- The **IISAdministration** module for PowerShell includes IIS management cmdlets, while the **WebAdministration** module for PowerShell includes cmdlets for managing web applications.
