Recall that a Microsoft Azure subscription is unit of management, billing, and scale.

Using Azure requires an Azure subscription is associated with your Microsoft account. The subscription provides authenticated and authorized access to Azure products and services. It also allows you to provision resources.

An account can have multiple subscriptions, but it’s only required to have one. You could use a second subscription to manage different projects, or different clients or customers.

As a key piece of how you use Azure, it’s important to at least be familiar with navigating a subscription.

Access your subscription by logging into your Azure account and selecting it from **Recent** resources, or by accessing the **Subscriptions** blade and then selecting your subscription.

Use the side menu to access other areas, such as the activity log, access control, tags, and cost management, and other settings such as resources and resource locks.

Take some time to explore your subscription and see what other information you can gather. Knowing where to quickly find information will help you manage your subscription and ask for help if the need arises.
