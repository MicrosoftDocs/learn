quiz:
  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "Which type of scaling involves adding or removing resources (such as virtual machines or containers) to meet demand?"
    choices:
    - content: "Vertical scaling"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Vertical scaling adjusts the capacity (CPU, RAM) of a single resource, not the number of resources."
    - content: "Horizontal scaling"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Horizontal scaling adds or removes instances of resources to match demand."
    - content: "Manual scaling"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Manual scaling refers to how scaling is triggered, not the type of scaling. Horizontal scaling is about the number of resources."
  - content: "What is the primary purpose of using tags in Azure resource management?"
    choices:
    - content: "To apply security policies to resources."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Security policies are managed through role-based access control and network security groups, not tags."
    - content: "To organize and group resources for reporting and cost management."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Tags help categorize resources and enable cost tracking and reporting."
    - content: "To restrict access to specific Azure services."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Access restrictions are handled through permissions and policies, not tags."
  - content: "Which Azure feature helps prevent accidental deletion or modification of critical resources?"
    choices:
    - content: "Role-based access control (RBAC)."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. RBAC manages who can access or modify resources, but it doesn’t prevent deletion if the user has permission."
    - content: "Resource locks"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Resource locks override permissions to prevent deletion or modification."
    - content: "Network security groups (NSGs)."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. NSGs control traffic flow, not resource deletion or modification."
  - content: "What is one way Microsoft Copilot in Azure can assist with infrastructure management?"
    choices:
    - content: "It can generate scripts or commands to perform tasks in Azure."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Copilot can provide Bicep, JSON, CLI, or Bash scripts to help manage resources."
    - content: "It replaces the Azure portal for all administrative tasks."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Copilot enhances the portal experience but doesn’t replace it."
    - content: "It only provides billing summaries and cost forecasts."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Copilot can provide billing insights, but its capabilities go far beyond that."
  - content: "Why would an Azure administrator use subnets within a virtual network in Azure?"
    choices:
    - content: "To increase the number of virtual networks in a region."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Subnets are subdivisions within a virtual network, not a method to increase the number of VNets."
    - content: "To segment resources for better security and traffic control."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Subnets allow segmentation and application of custom security and routing rules."
    - content: "To reduce the number of IP addresses used by a VNet."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Subnets divide IP ranges but don’t reduce the total number of IPs used."
