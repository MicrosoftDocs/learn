The vacuum process is configured using the **autovacuum** server parameters. These allow you to optimize the vacuum process for your workload. In the Azure portal, select your Azure Database for PostgreSQL server, and select **Server Parameters** from the left menu. In the search bar, enter **autovacuum**.

|autovacuum_vacuum_cost_limit               |-1         |The maximum cost for automatic vacuum operations. If -1 is specified, which is the default, the regular vacuum_cost_limit value is used.

The vacuum process shouldn't be run too frequently, or too infrequently. The optimal frequency will depend on the workload. Test each of the autovacuum parameters to find what works best for your workload. The cost of the vacuuming process includes:

- Data pages are locked when vacuum runs.
- The vacuum process consumes compute time and memory.

## Optimize vacuum at the table level

In Azure Database for PostgreSQL, autovacuum parameters can be set at the table level. When some tables are updated more than others, this can improve performance. An example of setting autovacuum at the table level:

```sql
ALTER TABLE mytable SET (autovacuum_vacuum_threshold = 1000);
â€‹ALTER TABLE mytable SET (autovacuum_vacuum_scale_factor = 0.1);
ALTER TABLE mytable SET (autovacuum_vacuum_cost_limit = 1000);
ALTER TABLE mytable SET (autovacuum_vacuum_cost_delay = 10);
```

At the table level, autovacuum is a synchronous process. The greater the percentage of dead tuples that a table has, the greater the "cost" is incurred by the autovacuum process.

For tables with a high rate of updates, consider splitting the table into multiple tables. This helps to parallelize autovacuum and reduce the "cost" for any one table. You also can increase the number of parallel autovacuum workers.
