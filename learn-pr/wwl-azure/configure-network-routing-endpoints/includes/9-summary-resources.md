Network routes control the flow of traffic through your network. You can customize these routes, implement service endpoints, and work with private links.

In this module, you learned how to implement system routes and user-defined routes. You identified features and usage cases for Azure Private Link and endpoint services. You explored how to configure a custom route, and discovered how to work with service endpoints.
