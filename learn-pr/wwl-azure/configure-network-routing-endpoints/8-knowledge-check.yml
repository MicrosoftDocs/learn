  - content: "How can you extend the company's private address space with direct connections to Azure resources?"
    choices:
    - content: "Virtual network endpoints"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Virtual network endpoints extend the private address space in Azure. Endpoints restrict the flow of traffic. As service endpoints are created, Azure creates routes in the route table to direct the traffic."
    - content: "User-defined routes"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. User-defined routes are created so Azure virtual appliances can handle the traffic both between subnets and to the internet."
    - content: "Virtual appliances"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Virtual appliances are for traffic control and high availability."
