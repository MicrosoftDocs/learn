In this module, we'll explore **dependency management** in modern software development. You'll learn what dependencies are, how to identify them in your codebase, and how to manage them effectively.

## Module overview

**Dependency management** is a critical aspect of software development. As projects grow in complexity, they rely on external libraries, frameworks, and components. Managing these dependencies properly ensures your software remains maintainable, secure, and efficient.

This module covers:

- **Understanding dependencies:** Learn what dependencies are and why they matter in software development.
- **Dependency management strategies:** Discover best practices for managing dependencies, including standardization, versioning, and package formats.
- **Identifying dependencies:** Learn techniques to identify and categorize dependencies in your projects.
- **Componentization:** Understand source componentization and package componentization approaches.
- **System decomposition:** Learn how to break down monolithic systems into manageable components.
- **Dependency scanning:** Use tools and techniques to scan your codebase for dependencies.

You'll work with popular package management tools like **Azure Artifacts**, **NuGet**, **npm**, and **Maven** to manage dependencies effectively.

## Learning objectives

After completing this module, you'll be able to:

- **Define dependency management strategy:** Understand the principles and benefits of managing dependencies in modern software development.
- **Identify dependencies:** Recognize and categorize different types of dependencies in your projects.
- **Describe elements and componentization of dependency management:** Understand how to decompose systems into manageable components.
- **Scan your codebase for dependencies:** Use tools and techniques to discover and analyze dependencies in your source code.

## Prerequisites

- Understanding of what **DevOps** is and its concepts
- Familiarity with version control principles
- Basic knowledge of software development and project structure
- Experience working with packages and libraries is helpful but not required
