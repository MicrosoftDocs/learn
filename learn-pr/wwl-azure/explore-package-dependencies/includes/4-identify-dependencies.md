This process begins with identifying the dependencies in your codebase and determining which ones will be officially recognized.<br>

Your software project and its associated solutions already use various dependencies. The use of libraries and frameworks authored by others is a widespread practice.

Your current codebase may contain internal dependencies that need to be officially acknowledged as such.

Consider a segment of code that encapsulates a specific business domain model. This code might be integrated as source code in your project and utilized across different projects and teams.

A thorough investigation of your codebase is necessary to pinpoint sections of code that should be classified as dependencies. This calls for modifying how you arrange your code and construct the solution. Eventually, it will contribute to the refinement of your components.
