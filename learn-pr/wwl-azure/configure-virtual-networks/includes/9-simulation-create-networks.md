## Exercise scenario

Your organization is migrating a web-based application to Azure. Your first task is to put in place the virtual networks and subnets. You also need to securely peer the virtual networks. You identify these requirements.

- Two virtual networks are required, app-vnet and hub-vnet. The virtual networks simulate a hub and spoke network architecture.
- The app-vnet hosts the application. The app-vnet virtual network requires two subnets. The frontend subnet hosts the web servers. The backend subnet hosts the database servers.
- The hub-vnet only requires a subnet for the firewall.
- The two virtual networks must be able to communicate with each other securely and privately through virtual network peering.
- Both virtual networks should be in the same region.
