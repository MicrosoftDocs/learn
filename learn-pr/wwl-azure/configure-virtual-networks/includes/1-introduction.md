Azure virtual networks are an essential component for creating private networks in Azure. They allow different Azure resources to securely communicate with each other, the internet, and on-premises networks.

Suppose you work for a company in the healthcare industry. Your company is looking to migrate their on-premises infrastructure to Azure. They want to ensure secure communication between their resources in Azure and their on-premises network. The company is also concerned about scalability and availability. By using Azure virtual networks, they can create a private network in Azure and securely connect their resources. 

The topics covered in this module include subnetting, creating virtual networks, and using private and public IP addresses. You also learn about the different scenarios where virtual networks can be used, such as creating a dedicated private cloud-only network or extending a data center securely. The module provides a detailed explanation of subnets and their benefits, and how to plan IP addressing for Azure resources.

By the end of this module, you have a clear understanding of how to create and configure virtual networks in Azure. You're able to effectively use subnets, assign IP addresses, and ensure secure communication between your Azure resources and on-premises network.
