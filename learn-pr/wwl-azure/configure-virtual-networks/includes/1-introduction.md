## Scenario

Your company is migrating to Azure. They want to replicate their on-premises network in the cloud. Azure resources must be organized into virtual networks and subnets. Your company requires an Azure IP addressing schema. The schema should provide flexibility, room for growth, and integration with on-premises networks. The schema should also minimize public exposure of systems, and give the organization flexibility in its network design. If not properly designed, systems might not be able to communicate, and additional work will be required to remediate.

You need to configure the necessary virtual networks and subnets, including IP addressing.

## Skills measured

Virtual network and subnets are part of [Exam AZ-104: Microsoft Azure Administrator](/learn/certifications/exams/az-104).

Configure and manage virtual networking (25–30%)

Implement and manage virtual networking

 -  Create and configure virtual networks.
 -  Implement subnets.
 -  Configure private and public IP addresses.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you will learn how to:

 -  Describe virtual network features and components.
 -  Identify features and usage cases for subnets and subnetting.
 -  Identify usage cases for private and public IP addresses.
 -  Create and determine which resources require public IP addresses.
 -  Create and determine which resources require private IP addresses.
 -  Create virtual networks.

## Prerequisites

 -  Familiarity with IP address formats and subnetting.
