In this module, you learned about Azure virtual networks and their importance in creating private networks in Azure. You explored the benefits of using virtual networks, such as scalability, availability, and isolation. You learned how to create virtual networks with subnetting and how to determine which resources require public or private IP addresses.

The main takeaways from this module are:

- Azure virtual networks allow different Azure resources to securely communicate with each other, the internet, and on-premises networks.

- Subnets within virtual networks provide logical divisions, improving security, performance, and management.

- When creating virtual networks, ensure that the IP address space is unique and doesn't overlap with other subnets. 

- IP addresses can provide public or private access to resources.
