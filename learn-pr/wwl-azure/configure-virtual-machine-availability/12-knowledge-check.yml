  title: ""
  questions:
  - content: "How can you ensure more virtual machines are deployed for the Admin team when the CPU is 75% consumed?"
    choices:
    - content: "Manually increase the instance count."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Manually increasing the instance count is time consuming and error prone."
    - content: "Change the CPU percentage to 50%."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. There's no need to change the CPU percentage requirement."
    - content: "Enable the autoscale option."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. To meet the Admin team scenario requirements, enable the autoscale option so more virtual machines are created when the CPU is 75% consumed."
  - content: "Which Virtual Machine Scale Sets feature can be configured to add more DevOps machines during peak production?"
    choices:
    - content: "Schedule-based rules"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. With schedule-based rules, administrators proactively schedule the scale set to deploy one or any number of instances."
    - content: "Autoscale"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Autoscale automatically increases or decreases the number of virtual machine instances that run the application. Is there a better solution based on demand?"
    - content: "Metric-based rules"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Metric-based rules are better for situations like CPU usage or storage disk capacity."
  - content: "What types of scaling can you use to increase the CPU _capacity_ for your existing Virtual Machine Scale Sets instances?"
    choices:
    - content: "Horizontal scaling"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Horizontal scaling increases the _number_ of instances within Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets."
    - content: "Vertical scaling"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Vertical scaling increases the _capacity_ of existing instances within Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets."
    - content: "Load balancing"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Load balancing distributes traffic across instances in Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets. Load balancing doesn't alter the number or performance of instances within Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets."
