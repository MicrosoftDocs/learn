Azure provides several high availability options for virtual machines. You can achieve high availability by using availability sets, availability zones, and Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets.

In this module, you learned how to configure virtual machine availability by using availability sets and availability zones with update and fault domains. You discovered how to autoscale virtual machines and configure vertical and horizontal scaling. You reviewed how to implement Virtual Machine Scale Sets, including storage resiliency and scalability options. You explored how to use Azure Virtual Machine Custom Script extensions to automatically configure virtual machines.

The main takeaways from this module are:

- Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets allow for the deployment and management of a group of identical virtual machines, making it easier to build large-scale services.

- Autoscaling with Virtual Machine Scale Sets helps optimize performance by automatically adjusting the number of instances based on workload demands.

- Availability sets and availability zones are important features in Azure for achieving high availability and fault tolerance for virtual machines.
