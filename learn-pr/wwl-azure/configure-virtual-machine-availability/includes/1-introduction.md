Managing virtual machines at scale can be challenging, especially when usage patterns vary and demands on applications fluctuate. Azure Administrators need to be able to adjust their virtual machine resources to match changing demands. At the same time, they need to keep their virtual machine configuration consistent to ensure application stability. Achieving these goals means maintaining throughput and responsiveness while minimizing the costs of continually running a large collection of virtual machines.

Your company website uses virtual machines and manages large workloads. The IT department wants to ensure the virtual machines can dynamically adjust to increases and decreases in workloads. They also want to ensure there's a business continuity plan to provide for highly available machines. You're responsible for deploying highly available virtual machines. You decide to use Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets and the autoscale feature.

In this module, you learn about scaling virtual machines. You learn about availability zones, availability sets, update and fault domains. You also learn about scale sets and autoscale.

The goal of this module is to learn how to successfully respond to changing virtual machine workloads. 

## Learning objectives
