Azure Front Door Service enables you to define, manage, and monitor the global routing for your web traffic by optimizing for performance and global failover for high availability. Front Door works at Layer 7 or HTTP/HTTPS layer and uses anycast protocol with split TCP and Microsoft's global network for improving global connectivity.

Depending on your routing method selection in the configuration, you can ensure that Front Door is routing your client requests to the fastest and most available application backend. An application backend is any Internet-facing service hosted inside or outside of Azure.

Front Door provides a range of traffic-routing methods and backend health monitoring options to suit different application needs and automatic failover models. Like Traffic Manager, Front Door is resilient to failures, including the failure of an entire Azure region.
