  title: ""
  questions:
  - content: "A company provides customers a virtual network in the cloud. There are dozens of Linux virtual machines in another virtual network. Which Azure load balancer should be used to direct traffic between the virtual networks?"
    choices:
    - content: "An external load balancer."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect.  Azure has two types of load balancers: public and internal."
    - content: "An internal load balancer."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. An internal load balancer directs traffic only to resources that are inside a virtual network or that use a VPN to access Azure infrastructure."
    - content: "A public load balancer."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A public load balancer maps the public IP address and port number of incoming traffic to the private IP address and port number of the VM."
  - content: "What is the default distribution type for traffic through a load balancer?"
    choices:
    - content: "Source IP affinity"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Affinity specifies that successive requests from the same client IP address and protocol combination will be handled by the same virtual machine."
    - content: "Three-tuple hash"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A three-tuple hash is not the distribution type."
    - content: "Five-tuple hash"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct.The load balancer uses a five-tuple (source IP, source port, destination IP, destination port, and protocol type) hash to map traffic to available servers."
  - content: "Which configuration is required for an internal load balancer?"
    choices:
    - content: "Virtual machines should be in the same virtual network."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The virtual machines that use a load balancer to distribute a load to must be in the same virtual network."
    - content: "Virtual machines must be publicly accessible."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Virtual machines that are behind an internal load balancer shouldn't be accessed publicly. The load balancer provides the access point."
    - content: "Virtual machines must be in an availability set."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Although this configuration is an option, it's not a requirement."
