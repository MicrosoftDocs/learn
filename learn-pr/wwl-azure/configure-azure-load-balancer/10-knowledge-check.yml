  title: ""
  questions:
  - content: "What's the default distribution type for traffic through a load balancer?"
    choices:
    - content: "Source IP affinity"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Affinity specifies that successive requests from the same client IP address and protocol combination are handled by the same virtual machine."
    - content: "Three-tuple hash"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A three-tuple hash isn't the distribution type."
    - content: "Five-tuple hash"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The load balancer uses a five-tuple (source IP, source port, destination IP, destination port, and protocol type) hash to map traffic to available servers."
  - content: "Which configuration is required for an internal load balancer?"
    choices:
    - content: "Virtual machines must be in the same virtual network."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The virtual machines that use a load balancer to distribute a load must be in the same virtual network."
    - content: "Virtual machines must be publicly accessible."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Virtual machines that are behind an internal load balancer shouldn't be accessed publicly. The load balancer provides the access point."
    - content: "Virtual machines must be in an availability set."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Although this configuration is an option, it's not a requirement."
