In this module, you learned about Azure Load Balancer and its features. Azure Load Balancer distributed workloads and network traffic across virtual machines, making applications more resilient and scalable. You learned about load balancer SKUs, back-end pools, load-balancing rules, session persistence, and health probes.

The main takeaways from this module are:

- Azure Load Balancer helps distribute network traffic across servers and resources.

- Load balancing can be used for inbound and outbound scenarios.

- There are public and internal load balancers.

- Load-balancing rules specify how traffic is distributed to your back-end pools. 

- Back-end pools contain the IP addresses of the virtual NICs that are connected to your load balancer. 

- Health probes dynamically add or remove virtual machines based on virtual machine health checks.
