  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "Your company maintains a database system that has only light use but holds mission critical information. You've been asked to ensure that every possible step is taken to ensure business continuity in the event of all known disasters. Which compute tier should you select for your Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server?"
    choices:
    - content: "General Purpose"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The General Purpose computer tier provides zone redundant high availability, and is suitable for light use."
    - content: "Burstable"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Zone redundant high availability isn't supported with the Burstable compute tier. Zone redundant high availability maintains three copies of the server, in different zones within a region."
    - content: "Memory optimized"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The Memory optimized compute tier supports zone redundant high availability but provides more memory than your light workload requires."
  - content: "Your company maintains a busy shopping application. You want to provide near-time reporting, without affecting performance on the Azure Database for PostgreSQL server. Which option would best suit your needs?"
    choices:
    - content: "Configure High Availability on your Azure Database for PostgreSQL server and use the replicated copy for reporting."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. High availability doesn't allow you to use the replicated copy for anything other than disaster recovery."
    - content: "Configure zone redundant High Availability on your Azure Database for PostgreSQL server and use the replicated copy for reporting."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Zone redundant high availability doesn't allow you to use the replicated copy for anything other than disaster recovery."
    - content: "Create a second Azure Database for PostgreSQL server and configure it as a subscriber. Configure your existing server as a publisher."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. If you configure your current server as a publisher, and a second server as a subscriber will allow you to create a replica of your database onto the subscriber server. This can then be used for near-time reporting, without affecting performance."
  - content: "Your company uses Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server to maintain its stock system. You want to use the contents of the write-ahead log (WAL) for auditing purposes. What is the best way of doing this?"
    choices:
    - content: "Copy the log from **pg_wal** directory."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Azure Database for PostgreSQL doesn't provide access to the file system or individual files. You can't copy the write ahead log file."
    - content: "Install the **pglogical** extension and use logical streaming replication."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Logical streaming replication provides access to data in the write ahead log."
    - content: "Configure zone redundant high availability."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Zone redundant high availability provides additional copies of your server that can be used in the event of a problem with your main server. However, this doesn't provide access to the write-ahead log."
