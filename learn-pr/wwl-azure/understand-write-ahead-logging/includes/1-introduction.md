PostgreSQL is an ACID-compliant database (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability). Durability means that any changes to the database aren't lost, even if there's a power cut or a disk fails. PostgreSQL does this using write ahead logging (WAL).

In this module. you'll learn how PostgreSQL prevents data loss using the write ahead log.

After completing this module, you'll be able to: 

- Describe write ahead logging.
- Understand replication and logical decoding.
