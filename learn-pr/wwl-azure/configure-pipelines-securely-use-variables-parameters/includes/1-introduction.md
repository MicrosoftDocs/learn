Using variables and parameters is a crucial part of Azure DevOps. They allow you to store and manage values that can be used across your pipelines, making managing your resources and configurations easier. However, if not used securely, they can pose a significant risk to your organization's security and confidentiality.

In this module, learn the fundamental concepts of variables and parameters, identify and restrict the insecure use of variables and parameters and move parameters into a YAML file that protects their kind. Explore limiting variables that can be set at queue time and validate that mandatory variables are present and set correctly.

### Learning objectives

After completing this module, students and professionals can:

- Ensure that parameters and variables retain their type.
- Identify and restrict insecure use of parameters and variables.
- Move parameters into a YAML file that protects their type.
- Limit variables that can be set at queue time.
- Validate that mandatory variables are present and set correctly in Azure DevOps.
