In this module, you learned the fundamental concepts of variables and parameters, identified and restricted insecure use of variables and parameters, and moved parameters into a YAML file that protects their kind. You also explored limiting variables that can be set at queue time and validated that mandatory variables are present and set correctly.

You learned how to:

- Ensure that parameters and variables retain their type.
- Identify and restrict insecure use of parameters and variables.
- Move parameters into a YAML file that protects their type.
- Limit variables that can be set at queue time.
- Validate that mandatory variables are present and set correctly in Azure DevOps.
