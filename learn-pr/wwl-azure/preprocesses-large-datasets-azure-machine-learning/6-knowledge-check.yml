quiz:
  questions:
  - content: "In which situation can a data scientist benefit the most from using GPU compute?"
    choices:
    - content: "When training a forecasting model on time-series data."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Standard machine learning models don't necessarily require GPU compute."
    - content: "When training a computer vision model to classify images."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Deep learning algorithms are highly likely to benefit from GPU because of the complexity of the algorithm and the need for a large dataset."
    - content: "When training a logistic regression model to predict customer churn."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Standard machine learning models don't necessarily require GPU compute."
  - content: "Which storage solution is recommended when training a computer vision model with Azure Machine Learning?"
    choices:
    - content: "Azure Blob Storage"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Although often used, a blob storage doesn't provide a hierarchical namespace."
    - content: "Azure SQL Database"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. An SQL database isn't optimized to store images."
    - content: "Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Files can be stored using a nested folder structure in a data lake because of the hierarchical namespace."
