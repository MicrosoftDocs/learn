- **Landscape**. Refers to the entire SAP assets in your IT landscape. The SAP landscape includes all production and non-production environments.
- **System**. The combination of DBMS layer and application layer of, for example, an SAP ERP development system, an SAP BW test system, and an SAP CRM production system.
- **Environment**. One or more SAP components logically grouped to perform a business function, such as development, quality assurance, training, disaster recovery, or production.
- **Component**. An individual SAP application, such as ERP Central Component (ECC), Business Warehouse (BW), Solution Manager, or Enterprise Portal (EP). SAP components can be based on traditional ABAP or Java technologies or a non-NetWeaver based application such as Business Objects.
- **AnyDB**. Any third party database chosen to run SAP (non-HANA).

> [!NOTE]
> SAP Landscapes are a way of organizing SAP servers into different tiers that are defined by how the system is used. Typical SAP deployments are divided into three different landscapes: DEV (Development), QAS (Quality Assurance), and PRD (Production). Smaller implementations may only have two landscapes, larger implementations may have four or more. Your SAP landscape is often hybrid from a DBMS and SAP application point of view. For example, a mixture of NetWeaver, and S/4HANA and SAP HANA and other DBMS.
