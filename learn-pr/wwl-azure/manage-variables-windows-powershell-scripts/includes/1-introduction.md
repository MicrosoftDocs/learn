In this module, you'll learn about variables and some rules for how to use them. These rules help ensure that the data you store in variables is in the correct format and easily accessible. When working with variables, it's important to name them appropriately, and to assign them the correct data type.

You'll learn how to identify the properties and methods for use in your scripts. You'll also learn how to manipulate the contents of variables.
