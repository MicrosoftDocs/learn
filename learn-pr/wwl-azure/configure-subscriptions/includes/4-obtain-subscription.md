## Enterprise agreements

Any [Enterprise Agreement](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/enterprise-agreement/) customer can add Azure to their agreement by making an upfront monetary commitment to Azure. That commitment is consumed throughout the year by using any combination of the wide variety of cloud services Azure offers. Enterprise agreements have a 99.95% monthly SLA.

## Reseller

Buy Azure through the [Open Licensing program](https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/licensing-programs/open-license.aspx), which provides a simple, flexible way to purchase cloud services from your Microsoft reseller. If you already purchased an Azure in Open license key, [activate a new subscription or add more credits now](https://azure.microsoft.com/offers/ms-azr-0111p/).

## Partners

Find a [Microsoft partner](https://azure.microsoft.com/partners/directory/) who can design and implement your Azure cloud solution. These partners have the business and technology expertise to recommend solutions that meet the unique needs of your business.

## Personal free account

With a [free trial account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/), you can get started using Azure right away and you won’t be charged until you choose to upgrade.
