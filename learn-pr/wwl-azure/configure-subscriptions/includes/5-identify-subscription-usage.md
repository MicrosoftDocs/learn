We reviewed the ways you can obtain an Azure subscription. Now let's look at the types of Azure subscriptions that are available.

Azure offers free and paid subscription options to meet different needs and requirements. The most common subscriptions are **Free**, **Pay-As-You-Go**, **Enterprise Agreement**, and **Student**. For your organization, you can choose a combination of procurement options and subscription choices to meet your business scenarios.

### Things to consider when choosing Azure subscriptions

As you think about which types of Azure subscriptions would work for your organization, consider these scenarios:

- **Consider trying Azure for free**. An Azure free subscription includes a monetary credit to spend on any service for the first 30 days. You get free access to the most popular Azure products for 12 months, and access to more than 25 products that are always free. An Azure free subscription is an excellent way for new users to get started.
   - To set up a free subscription, you need a phone number, a credit card, and a Microsoft account.
   - The credit card information is used for identity verification only. You aren't charged for any services until you upgrade to a paid subscription.

- **Consider paying monthly for used services**. A Pay-As-You-Go (PAYG) subscription charges you monthly for the services you used in that billing period. This subscription type is appropriate for a wide range of users, from individuals to small businesses, and many large organizations as well.

- **Consider using an Azure Enterprise Agreement**. An Enterprise Agreement provides flexibility to buy cloud services and software licenses under one agreement. The agreement comes with discounts for new licenses and Software Assurance. This type of subscription targets enterprise-scale organizations.

- **Consider supporting Azure for students**. An Azure for Students subscription includes a monetary credit that can be used within the first 12 months.
  - Students can select free services without providing a credit card during the sign-up process.
  - You must verify your student status through your organizational email address.
