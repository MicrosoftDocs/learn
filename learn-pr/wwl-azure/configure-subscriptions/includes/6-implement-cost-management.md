With Azure products and services, you only pay for what you use. As you create and use Azure resources, you are charged for the resources. You use Azure Cost Management and Billing features to conduct billing administrative tasks and manage billing access to costs. You also use its features to monitor and control Azure spending and to optimize Azure resource usage.

Cost Management shows organizational cost and usage patterns with advanced analytics. Reports in Cost Management show the usage-based costs consumed by Azure services and third-party Marketplace offerings. Costs are based on negotiated prices and factor in reservation and Azure Hybrid Benefit discounts. Collectively, the reports show your internal and external costs for usage and Azure Marketplace charges. Other charges, such as reservation purchases, support, and taxes are not yet shown in reports. The reports help you understand your spending and resource use and can help find spending anomalies. Predictive analytics are also available. Cost Management uses Azure management groups, budgets, and recommendations to show clearly how your expenses are organized and how you might reduce costs.

You can use the Azure portal or various APIs for export automation to integrate cost data with external systems and processes. Automated billing data export and scheduled reports are also available.

## Plan and control expenses

The ways that Cost Management help you plan for and control your costs include: Cost analysis, budgets, recommendations, and exporting cost management data.

 -  **Cost analysis**. You use cost analysis to explore and analyze your organizational costs. You can view aggregated costs by organization to understand where costs are accrued and to identify spending trends. And you can see accumulated costs over time to estimate monthly, quarterly, or even yearly cost trends against a budget.
 -  **Budgets**. Budgets help you plan for and meet financial accountability in your organization. They help prevent cost thresholds or limits from being surpassed. Budgets can also help you inform others about their spending to proactively manage costs. And with them, you can see how spending progresses over time.
 -  **Recommendations**. Recommendations show how you can optimize and improve efficiency by identifying idle and underutilized resources. Or, they can show less expensive resource options. When you act on the recommendations, you change the way you use your resources to save money. To act, you first view cost optimization recommendations to view potential usage inefficiencies. Next, you act on a recommendation to modify your Azure resource use to a more cost-effective option. Then you verify the action to make sure that the change you make is successful.
 -  **Exporting cost management data.** If you use external systems to access or review cost management data, you can easily export the data from Azure. And you can set a daily scheduled export in CSV format and store the data files in Azure storage. Then, you can access the data from your external system.
