### Things to know about Microsoft Cost Management

Your organization is interested in the benefits of using Microsoft Cost Management to monitor their subscription billing and resource usage. As you plan for your implementation, review the following product characteristics and features:

### Things to consider when using Microsoft Cost Management

Microsoft Cost Management can help you plan for and control your organization costs. Consider how the product features can be implemented to support your business scenarios:

- **Consider cost analysis**. Take advantage of Microsoft Cost Management cost analysis features to explore and analyze your organizational costs.

Monitor accumulated costs over time to estimate monthly, quarterly, or even yearly cost trends against a budget.

- **Consider budget options**. Use Microsoft Cost Management features to establish and maintain budgets. The product helps you plan for and meet financial accountability in your organization. Budgets help prevent cost thresholds or limits from being surpassed. You can utilize analysis data to inform others about their spending to proactively manage costs. The budget features help you see how company spending progresses over time.

- **Consider recommendations**. Review the Microsoft Cost Management recommendations to learn how you can optimize and improve efficiency by identifying idle and underutilized resources. Recommendations can reveal less expensive resource options. When you act on the recommendations, you change the way you use your resources to save money. Using recommendations is an easy process:
   1. View cost optimization recommendations to see potential usage inefficiencies.
   1. Act on a recommendation to modify your Azure resource use and implement a more cost-effective option.
   1. Verify the new action to make sure the change has the desired effect.

   - Access your exported data from your external system.
