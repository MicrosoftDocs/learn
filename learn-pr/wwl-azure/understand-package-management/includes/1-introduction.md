 -  For some exercises, you need to create an Azure DevOps Organization and a Team Project. If you don't have it yet, see:
     -  [Create an organization - Azure DevOps.](/azure/devops/organizations/accounts/create-organization)
     -  If you already have your organization created, use the [Azure DevOps Demo Generator](https://azuredevopsdemogenerator.azurewebsites.net), and create a new Team Project called "Parts Unlimited" using the template "PartsUnlimited". Or feel free to create a blank project. See [Create a project - Azure DevOps.](/azure/devops/organizations/projects/create-project)
