Welcome to this interactive skills validation experience. Completing this module helps prepare you for the ***Implement storage for Azure Files and Azure Blob Storage*** assessment.

In this module, you practice storing business data securely by using Azure Blob Storage and Azure Files. This module combines both learning and hands-on practice. The skills validated include creating storage accounts, storage containers, and file shares. Also, configuring encryption and networking to improve the security posture.

> [!NOTE]
> This is a guided project module where you complete an end-to-end project by following step-by-step instructions. 

## Requirements

Your organization is migrating storage to Azure. As the Azure Administrator your help is needed to configure the storage requirements. Your analysis shows that different audiences have different storage requirements. 

:::image type="content" source="../media/task-overview.png" alt-text="Diagram of customer requirements." border="false":::

* The IT department needs storage for test and development scenarios. They also need to train new personnel on how to properly configure the storage.  
* The company website needs storage. Customers use the website to order products. The storage must be highly available with low latency.   
* The company employees need access to private corporate information. Access to these proprietary documents should be tightly controlled. Partners may need access, but only on a temporary basis.  
* The company offices need shared file storage. Specifically, the finance department needs to gather information and share financial statements. 
* The company developers are creating a new app that requires storage. The developers need to manage credentials and secure communication with the app storage.
