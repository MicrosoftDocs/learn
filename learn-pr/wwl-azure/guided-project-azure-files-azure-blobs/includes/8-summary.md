In this module, you learned about different storage scenarios and how to provide storage for each of them. 
- The first scenario was providing storage for the IT department's testing and training. For this scenario, you learned how to create a storage account and configure basic settings for security and networking. 
- The second scenario was providing storage for the public website. You learned how to create a storage account with anonymous public access, create a blob storage container, and enable soft delete and versioning. 
- The third scenario was providing private storage for internal company documents. You learned how to create a storage container with restricted access and configure a shared access signature for partners. You also learned how to back up the public website storage and implement lifecycle management to move content to the cool tier. 
- The fourth scenario provided shared file storage for the company offices and storage for a new company app.
