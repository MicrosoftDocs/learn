[Transformations](/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/data-collection-transformations) are [KQL queries](/azure/azure-monitor/logs/log-query-overview) included in a DCR that run against each record sent to the cloud pipeline. They allow you to modify incoming data before it's stored in Azure Monitor or sent to another destination. You may filter unneeded data to reduce your ingestion costs, remove sensitive data that shouldn't be persisted in the Log Analytics workspace, or format data to ensure that it matches the schema of its destination. Transformations also enable advanced scenarios such as sending data to multiple destinations or enriching data with additional information.
