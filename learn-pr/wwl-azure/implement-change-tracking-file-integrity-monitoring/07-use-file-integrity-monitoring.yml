  title: "Quick review"
  questions:
  - content: "At 0:50 to 1:00 minutes in the demonstration, the instructor changes the configuration of a Log Analytics workspace. What does the instructor do and why?"
    choices:
    - content: "The instructor selects **ENABLE** on the workspace to allow its use with File Integrity Monitoring."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The instructor does perform this task, but first, he must upgrade the workspace."
    - content: "The instructor selects **Install agents** on the workspace to deploy agents to all the VMs associated with the workspace."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Although agents must be installed, that process begins with upgrading the pricing tier."
    - content: "The instructor selects **UPGRADE PLAN** on the workspace to change the workspace to Standard Tier pricing. Unless the workspace is on this pricing tier, it cannot be used for File Integrity Monitoring."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Both the Security Center and the Log Analytics workspace must be on Standard Tier pricing."
