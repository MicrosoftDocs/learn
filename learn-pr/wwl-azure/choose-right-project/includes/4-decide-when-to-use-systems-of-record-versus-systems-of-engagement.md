When selecting systems as candidates for starting a DevOps transformation, it is necessary to consider the types of systems that you operate.

Some researchers suggest that organizations often use Bimodal IT, a practice of managing two separate, coherent modes of IT delivery - one focused on stability and predictability and the other on agility.

## Systems of record

Systems that provide the truth about data elements are often-called systems of record. These systems have historically evolved slowly and carefully. For example, it is crucial that a banking system accurately reflects your bank balance. Systems of record emphasize accuracy and security.

## Systems of engagement

Many organizations have other systems that are more exploratory. These often use experimentation to solve new problems. Systems of engagement are modified regularly. Usually, it is a priority to make quick changes over ensuring that the changes are correct.

There is a perception that DevOps suits systems of engagement more than systems of record. The lessons from high-performing companies show that is not the case.

Sometimes, the criticality of doing things right with a system of record is an excuse for not implementing DevOps practices.

Worse, given the way that applications are interconnected, an issue in a system of engagement might end up causing a problem in a system of record anyway.

Both types of systems are great. At the same time, it might be easier to start with a system of engagement when first beginning a DevOps Transformation.

DevOps practices apply to both types of systems. The most significant outcomes often come from transforming systems of record.
