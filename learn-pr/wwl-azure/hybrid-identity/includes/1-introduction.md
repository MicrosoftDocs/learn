Hybrid Identity is the process of connecting your on-premises Active Directory with your Azure Active Directory. You do this to enable a single account to have access to resources on-premises and in the cloud. There are many other security benefits as well.

## Scenario

 -  Connect your on-premises AD with your Azure AD.
 -  Select the best authentication option based on your user's needs and your security goals.
 -  Configure authentication options to create your most secure environment.
