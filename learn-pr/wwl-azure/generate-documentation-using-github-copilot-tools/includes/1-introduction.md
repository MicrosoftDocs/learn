This module explores how to explain and document code using the GitHub Copilot Chat extension for Visual Studio Code. The explain and document features are accessible using the chat view, smart actions, inline chat, and quick chat interfaces.

Imagine you're a developer working for a large tech company. You're assigned to take over a project that's fallen behind schedule. You discover that the code is complex, poorly documented, and difficult to understand. You need to generate documentation for the project but you're unsure where to start. GitHub Copilot Chat can help you understand the code and generate relevant documentation. Using GitHub Copilot Chat helps you complete documentation tasks quickly and efficiently.

The topics covered in this module include:

- Examining the features of GitHub Copilot Chat that can be used to explain code and generate documentation.
- Using GitHub Copilot Chat to generate explanations for complex or unfamiliar code.
- Using GitHub Copilot Chat to generate project documentation.
- Using GitHub Copilot Chat to generate inline code documentation and pull request summaries.
- Completing a "code documentation" challenge activity and reviewing a possible solution.

By the end of this module, you're able to use GitHub Copilot Chat to explain complex or unfamiliar code, generate relevant documentation, and increase your efficiency as a developer.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>  To complete this module's activities, you must configure your account to allow GitHub Copilot suggestions that match public code. If you're a member of an organization on GitHub Enterprise Cloud who has been assigned a GitHub Copilot seat through your organization, the setting for suggestions matching public code will be inherited from your organization or enterprise. If your account blocks suggestions that match public code, module activities won't work as expected.
