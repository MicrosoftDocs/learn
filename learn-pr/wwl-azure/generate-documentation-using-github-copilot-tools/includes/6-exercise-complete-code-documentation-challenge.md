Code challenges reinforce what you've learned and help you gain some confidence before proceeding.

### Challenge: Create project and inline documentation for an existing app

You've been asked to review an existing app and then create the project and inline documentation.

This challenge is not about crafting documentation that achieves a specific standard. Instead, it's about using GitHub Copilot Chat to help you generate inline and project documentation more efficiently.

### Prepare your coding environment

In this challenge, you use Visual Studio Code and the GitHub Copilot extensions to document a sample project. The sample project you work with is named **APL2007M2Sample2**. The project is included in the **SampleApps** folder that you downloaded when you completed the "Generate code explanations using GitHub Copilot Chat" unit earlier in this module.

1. Open the **APL2007M2Sample2** folder in Visual Studio Code.

    1. Open Visual Studio Code on your PC.
    1. In Visual Studio Code, on the **File** menu, select **Open Folder**.
    1. Navigate to the Windows Desktop folder, open the **SampleApps** folder, and locate the **APL2007M2Sample2** folder.
    1. Select **APL2007M2Sample2** and then select **Select Folder**.

1. Verify that the **APL2007M2Sample2** project contains the following files:

    The Visual Studio Code EXPLORER view should display a APL2007M2Sample2 code project containing a media folder and the following files:

    - APL2007M2Sample2.csproj
    - APL2007M2Sample2.sln
    - Program.cs

You're now ready to complete this challenge.

### Documentation requirements for this challenge

Your documentation must include the following items:

1. Inline code documentation for the Program.cs file. Your inline code documentation should include:

    - Documentation for the Device class.
    - Documentation for each property and method of the Device class.

1. Project documentation formatted as markdown. The project documentation should contain the following sections:

    - **Overview**: A brief overview of the project.
    - **Features**: A list of the features of the project.
    - **Requirements**: A list of the requirements for the project.
    - **Constraints**: A list of the constraints for the project.
    - **Dependencies**: A list of the dependencies for the project.
    - **Summary**: A summary of the project.

1. README file contents that can be used for the code project repository. The README contents should be formatted as markdown and contain the following sections:

    - **Project Title**: A brief, clear title for the project.
    - **Description**: A detailed explanation of what the project is and what it does.
    - **Setup instructions**: Instructions for how to install and set up the project.
    - **Usage**: Instructions on how to use the project, often including code examples.
    - **Contributor guidelines**: Guidelines for how others can contribute to the project.
    - **License**: The license that the project is under.

### Instructions

Use the following steps to complete this challenge:

1. Verify that the project builds without an error when you run `dotnet build` in the Terminal.

1. Use GitHub Copilot Chat in Visual Studio Code to generate inline and project documentation.

1. Review the generated documentation to ensure that it meets the requirements.

1. Once you've completed the documentation, save the changes to the project.

1. After saving the documented code, verify that the project builds without an error when you run `dotnet build` in the Terminal.

Good luck! When you're done, review the solution described in the next unit.
