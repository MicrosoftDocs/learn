In this module, you learn how to handle date and time effectively in C# applications that focus on scheduling meetings and logging events across different time zones.

Imagine you're a programmer working for a global company that schedules meetings and logs events across various time zones. You need to ensure that meetings are scheduled accurately and events are logged correctly, regardless of the participants' locations. For instance, you might have a team member in New York and another in Tokyo, and you need to schedule a meeting that works for both. Additionally, you need to log the event times accurately for reporting purposes. Handling date and time in such scenarios can be challenging due to differences in time zones, daylight saving changes, and cultural-specific date formats. This module equips you with the knowledge and tools to manage these complexities effectively.

## Learning objectives

- Use `DateOnly`, `TimeOnly`, and `DateTime` classes to represent dates and times.
- Perform time zone conversions and interval calculations using `DateTimeOffset`, `TimeZoneInfo`, and `TimeSpan`.
- Retrieve and manipulate day of the week information using `DayOfWeek`.
- Handle culture-specific data using `CultureInfo`.
- Perform calendar-related operations using `Calendar` and define rules for determining the first week of the year using `CalendarWeekRule`.

## Prerequisites

- Visual Studio Code installed with the C# Dev Kit.
- Basic knowledge of the Visual Studio Code IDE.
- Basic understanding of the C# programming language.
- Familiar with classes, abstract classes, interfaces and inheritance.
