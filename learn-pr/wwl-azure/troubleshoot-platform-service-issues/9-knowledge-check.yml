  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "What is the best method for troubleshooting Azure Storage?"
    choices:
    - content: "Use user feedback to assess what is likely to cause real-world problems."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. It's more accurate to use monitoring tools than user feedback."
    - content: "Reactively troubleshoot to provide accurate data on the problem."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. It's better to prevent the problem before it escalates."
    - content: "Proactively troubleshoot to prevent the escalation of a problem."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. It's better to proactively troubleshoot and prevent a problem from escalating."
  - content: "How does Azure Private Link connect from a private network to Azure PaaS services?"
    choices:
    - content: "Over the Internet."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Azure Private Link doesn't use the public Internet."
    - content: "Over the Microsoft backbone network."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Azure Private Link provides a link from a virtual network to the Azure PaaS services over the Microsoft backbone network rather than over the public Internet."
    - content: "Over a private satellite network."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Azure Private Link isn't a satellite network."
  - content: "If a new CDN service isn't available, how should this be resolved?"
    choices:
    - content: "Ensure that files for compression are less than 10 MB in size."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. For Verizon CDN profiles, verify that the file is between 128 bytes and 3 MB."
    - content: "Wait for 90 minutes for the CDN service to deploy."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. It can take up to 90 minutes for a CDN to deploy."
    - content: "Delete the CDN and recreate it."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The CDN might have been deployed correctly."
  - content: "If an application running on a target VM can't be accessed, how can this be resolved?"
    choices:
    - content: "Verify that you aren't blocked by NSGs."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. NSGs would only filter data on a network."
    - content: "Check that it's running and listening on the correct TCP and UDP ports."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Check that it's running and listening on the correct TCP and UDP ports."
    - content: "Check anything that could be filtering traffic such as a firewall."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. A firewall would filter traffic on a network."
  - content: "If a customer can't configure a particular property on a delegated subnet, what is the most likely reason?"
    choices:
    - content: "The deployment model for that Azure service has been defined to not support changes to that property."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. If a customer can't configure a particular property, it's likely that the deployment model for that Azure service has been defined to not support changes to that property."
    - content: "The customer's virtual network is blocking traffic."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. If the customer's virtual network was blocking traffic, they wouldn't be able to change any property."
    - content: "The customer's subscription doesn't support configuration changes."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. A customer's subscription shouldn't affect their ability to configure a delegated subnet."
