  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "You've been asked to set up your company's Azure Database for PostgreSQL server. The database must be accessed from anywhere on the internet. Which setup option should you choose?"
    choices:
    - content: "Hyperscale with private networking access."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Private networking access won't allow the server to be accessed from anywhere on the internet."
    - content: "Flexible server with public networking access."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Flexible server is a good choice for a new installation, and public networking access will allow the server to be accessed from anywhere on the internet."
    - content: "Flexible server with private networking access."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Flexible server is a good choice for new installations, but private networking access won't allow the server to be accessed from anywhere on the internet."
  - content: "You want to assign a co-administrator for your Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server, so that someone else has access if you aren't available. You would like them to be able to do anything and everything on the server. What role should be assigned to the user account?"
    choices:
    - content: "azuresu"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Azuresu allows the user super user permissions on the server, but isn't available to administrator accounts that you can create."
    - content: "pg_read_all_settings"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. pg_read_all_settings doesn't allow the user full admin permissions on the server."
    - content: "azure_pg_admin"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. pg_admin allows the user full admin permissions on the server, and is available to assign to another administrator."
  - content: "Your company is required to encrypt sensitive data while it's stored on disk. As the result of an internal audit, you realize that sensitive data is being held on your Azure for PostgreSQL flexible server. What should you do?"
    choices:
    - content: "Nothing - your data is already encrypted."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Azure for PostgreSQL flexible server automatically encrypts data at rest, and in transit, with keys managed by Microsoft."
    - content: "Migrate your data to Azure Database for PostgreSQL hyperscale so that data can be encrypted with your own keys."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. There's no need to migrate your data to a different implementation of Azure Database for PostgreSQL."
    - content: "Set two server parameters and restart the server."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. There are no server parameters for encrypting data at rest on Azure Database for PostgreSQL servers."
  - content: "What does the following query do? CREATE ROLE \"kerry@allen.dev\" WITH LOGIN **SUPERUSER**;"
