One of the teams you support contacts you. The team has trouble connecting to their VM using Bastion. In this exercise, you see how to troubleshoot the Azure Bastion Service.

Bastion isn't supported in the Learn sandbox environment. To view this exercise, watch the video at the end. If you'd like to follow along in your own subscription, you can use the following steps.

> You need your own [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?azure-portal=true) to complete the exercises in this module. If you don't have an Azure subscription, you can still read along.

## Check that Bastion is deployed

1. In the Azure portal, in the search box, type **Bastions**.

   :::image type="content" source="../media/check-bastion-setup.png" alt-text="A screenshot showing the Bastion service being searched for and then selected.":::

1. From the results, under **Services**, select **Bastions**.

1. You should see the Bastion service listed.

   :::image type="content" source="../media/bastion-list.png" alt-text="A screenshot showing the list of created Azure Bastions.":::

   If there aren’t any Bastion services listed, create one.

## Check if there’s a private DNS zone

1. In the Azure portal, in the search box, type **private dns**.

   :::image type="content" source="../media/private-zones.png" alt-text="A screenshot of the Azure portal, searching for private D N S, and selecting Private D N S zones.":::

1. From the results, under **Services**, select **Private DNS zones**.

   :::image type="content" source="../media/no-private-zones.png" alt-text="A screenshot showing that no private D N S zones are being used.":::
1. You shouldn’t see any private DNS zones.

1. If there are any zones listed, check that they don’t end in **azure.com** or **core.windows.net**.

## Check if AzureBastionSubnet is using a Network Security Group correctly

1. In the Azure portal, in the search box, type **Bastions**.

1. From the results, under **Services**, select **Bastions**.

1. Select the Bastion you're troubleshooting.

   :::image type="content" source="../media/azure-bastion-subnet-link.png" alt-text="A screenshot showing the Virtual network/subnet link on the Bastion pane." lightbox="../media/azure-bastion-subnet-link.png":::

1. In the top right, select the **Virtual network/subnet** link.

   :::image type="content" source="../media/virtual-network-subnets.png" alt-text="A screenshot of the subnets menu highlighted on the virtual network pane, with the AzureBastionSubnet selected." lightbox="../media/virtual-network-subnets.png":::

1. Under **Settings**, select **Subnets**, and then choose **AzureBastionSubnet**.

   :::image type="content" source="../media/azure-bastion-subnet-settings-nsg.png" alt-text="A screenshot showing that the AzureBastionSubnet has no Network Security Group associated with it.":::

> [!NOTE]
> If Azure Bastion has a **Network security group** associated with the subnet, you need to check that it has all the inbound and outbound rules created.

## Run the Connection Troubleshoot tool to check for issues

1. In the Azure portal, in the search box, type **Bastions**.

1. From the results, under **Services**, choose **Bastions**.

1. Select the Bastion you're troubleshooting.

1. Under **Monitoring**, select **Connection Troubleshoot**.

1. Under **Virtual machine**, select the VM you want to connect to.

1. Select your **Preferred IP Version**.

1. In the **Destination port**, if you want to use **RDP**, enter **3389**, if you want to use **SSH**, enter **22**.

1. Select **Check**.
