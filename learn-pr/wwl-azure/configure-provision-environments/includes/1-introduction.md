## Prerequisites

 -  Understanding of what DevOps is and its concepts.
 -  Familiarity with version control principles is helpful but isn't necessary.
 -  Beneficial to have experience in an organization that delivers software.
 -  You must create an Azure DevOps Organization and a Team Project for some exercises. If you don't have it yet, see: [Create an Organization - Azure DevOps](/azure/devops/organizations/accounts/create-organization).
     -  If your organization is already created, use the [Azure DevOps Demo Generator](https://azuredevopsdemogenerator.azurewebsites.net/) and create a new Team Project called "Parts Unlimited" using the template "PartsUnlimited". Or feel free to create a blank project. See [Create a Project - Azure DevOps](/azure/devops/organizations/projects/create-project).
