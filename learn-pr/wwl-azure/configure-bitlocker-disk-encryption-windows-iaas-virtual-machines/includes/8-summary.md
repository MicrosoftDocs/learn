The security team at Contoso wanted to know how they could ensure that their Windows Server IaaS VMs VHDs are encrypted. Encryption must meet corporate security standards. They also needed to know that they can recover a Windows Server IaaS VMâ€™s encrypted VHDs; for example, in the event that the VM suffers data corruption and must be restored.

In this module, you learned about Azure Disk Encryption and its requirements. You also learned to configure Key Vault to support Azure Disk Encryption. Finally, you learned how to encrypt Azure IaaS VM hard disks, and how to back up and recover encrypted data when necessary. Now, you and Contoso's IT security team can effectively use Azure Disk Encryption ensuring that the corporate security standards are met.
