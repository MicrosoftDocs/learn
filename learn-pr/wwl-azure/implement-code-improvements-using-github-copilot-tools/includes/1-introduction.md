This module explores using the GitHub Copilot Chat extension for Visual Studio Code to implement code improvements. You learn about making improvements to code quality, code reliability, code performance, and code security. Prompts are developed for each improvement area and submitted to GitHub Copilot for suggestions on how to improve selected code. Exercises teach you how to craft prompts that generate suggestions for specific improvement areas. Exercises also demonstrate how to implement code updates suggestions, accelerate your development process, and improve the quality of your code.

Imagine you're a developer working on a project that requires secure and efficient code. Delivery deadlines are approaching and the codebase that you inherited is more proof-of-concept than production code. You're concerned that you won't have enough time to thoroughly review the codebase and implement the required updates. You need a tool that can quickly identify areas for improvement in the existing code. The tool should also accelerate the development process for any updates you decide to implement. You want to investigate updates that address code quality, reliability, performance, and security. You hear that GitHub Copilot can help developers evaluate code, identify areas for improvements, and efficiently update their codebase. You're looking forward to accelerating your code improvement process using GitHub Copilot.

The topics covered in this module include:

- Using GitHub Copilot to improve your code.
- Improving code quality with GitHub Copilot Chat.
- Improving code reliability and performance with GitHub Copilot Chat.
- Improving code security with GitHub Copilot Chat.
- Completing an "app improvement" challenge and reviewing a possible solution.

By the end of this module, you're able to use the GitHub Copilot Chat extension for Visual Studio Code to generate and implement code update suggestions that improve code quality, reliability, performance, and security.
