Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) and its related services form the foundation for enterprise networks that run Windows and non-Windows operating systems. The AD DS database is the central store of all the domain objects, such as user accounts, computer accounts, and groups.

## Scenario

Imagine you are an IT administrator for a large organization that uses both Windows and non-Windows operating systems. You need to manage your infrastructure efficiently, which includes tasks like installing, configuring, and updating apps, managing the security infrastructure, enabling Remote Access Service and Direct Access, and issuing and managing digital certificates. To do this effectively, you need to understand how AD DS components work together.

## Learning objectives

By the end of this module, you'll be able to:

 -  Define Active Directory Domain Services.
 -  Define Active Directory Domain Services forests and domains.
 -  Deploy Active Directory Domain Services domain controllers.
 -  Migrate a domain controller to a new site.
 -  Manage Active Directory Domain Services operations masters.
