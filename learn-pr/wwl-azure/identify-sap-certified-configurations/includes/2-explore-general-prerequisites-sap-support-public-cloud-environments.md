- SAP system sizing and knowledge of resource requirements of SAP workloads to be deployed.
- Certified virtual machine instance sizes and total capacity required by SAP software on the cloud provider platform.
- Sufficient network connectivity (for bandwidth, latency, and package loss) to the cloud environment that will host SAP workloads.
- Certified operating systems on which the SAP workloads will be deployed.
- Support agreement available from the cloud provider.
- Experience with technical operation of SAP systems and the infrastructure of the cloud provider pertinent to the shared responsibilities model.

To implement SAP workloads on Azure in a supported manner, customers should follow SAP certified configurations, which consist of a combination of the following four elements:

- **SAP product**
- **Operating system**
- **RDBMS**
- **Azure offering**, including Azure Virtual Machine SKUs

This information is summarized at [SAP certifications and configurations running on Microsoft Azure](/azure/virtual-machines/workloads/sap/sap-certifications).
