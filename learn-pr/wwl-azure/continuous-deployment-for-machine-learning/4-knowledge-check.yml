  questions:
  - content: "A data scientist is experimenting with model training. After some iterations, one model seems suitable for deployment but isn't quite ready for consumption yet. An Azure Pipeline is created to train the model. Which environment should the model be trained in first?"
    choices:
    - content: "Production"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. You should deploy to production when everything has been tested."
    - content: "Pre-production"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. You should deploy the model to pre-production when it's ready for production, but you want to test it before it moves to production."
    - content: "Development"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. A safe first step is to train a model in the development environment, triggered by an Azure Pipeline."
  - content: "How can a machine learning engineer control the movement of a model from development to pre-production?"
    choices:
    - content: "Add a trigger."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A trigger is needed to run a pipeline or workflow."
    - content: "Add an approval check."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. An approval check will require someone to review a pipeline before it's executed."
    - content: "Add RBAC."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Use RBAC to give access to resources like the Azure Machine Learning pipeline."
