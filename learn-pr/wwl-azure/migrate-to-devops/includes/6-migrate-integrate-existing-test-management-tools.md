Azure Test Plans are used to track manual testing for sprints and milestones, allowing you to follow when that testing is complete.

Azure DevOps also has a Test Feedback extension available in the Visual Studio Marketplace. The extension is used to help teams do exploratory testing and provide feedback.

All team members and other stakeholders can use the extension to submit bugs or provide feedback. For example:

 -  Developers.
 -  Product owners.
 -  Managers.
 -  UX.
 -  UI engineers.
 -  Marketing teams.
 -  Early adopters.

[Apache JMeter](/azure/devops/test/load-test/get-started-jmeter-test) is open-source software written in Java and designed to load test and measure performance.

Pester is a tool that can be used to automate the testing of PowerShell code.

SoapUI is another testing framework for SOAP and REST testing.

If you are using Microsoft Test Manager, you should plan to migrate to Azure Test Plans instead.

For more information, search for Test Management at Visual Studio Marketplace.
