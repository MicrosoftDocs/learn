  title: "Check Your Knowledge on CSS Concepts"
  questions:
  - content: "To make all `h2` elements on your page bold using a single style command, what method should be used?"
    choices:
    - content: "Use a CSS selector for h2 to set the style."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. By using an h2 selector, you can set the style for all the h2 tags with a single command."
    - content: "Use the style tag on each h2 element using copy and paste."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This answer is incorrect. While this would work, it duplicates the style rather than using a single style command."
    - content: "Enclose the h2 tag in a style tag."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This answer is incorrect. Using a CSS selector is a best practice."
  - content: "Which best describes methods to set the `color` property for a font?"
    choices:
    - content: "Use RGB values such as `color: rgb(105, 6, 19)` or `color: #7462e0;`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That answer is incorrect. While RGB values would achieve the goal, there are multiple methods available."
    - content: "Use named color values such as `color: brown;` or `color: lightgrey;`."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That answer is incorrect. While named color values would achieve the goal, there are multiple methods available."
    - content: "Use either RGB or named values."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. you can use either RGB or named color values to set the color property"
  - content: "Which is the best method to apply the same styles to multiple elements?"
    choices:
    - content: "Change all elements to the same tag and use a tag selector in CSS"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That answer is incorrect. You can use custom selectors with the class attribute to change any element using that selector."
    - content: "Create a custom selector and assign the `class` attribute on the elements to that selector."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The `class` attribute enables you to refer to a single selector on many elements."
    - content: "Create a custom selector and assign the `id` attribute on the elements to that selector."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That answer is incorrect. The `id` property can be used on only one element. The class attribute allows you to use a selector on more than one element."
