In an organization, there may be various profiles created for different purposes, and some devices may have multiple profiles assigned based on specific criteria. It's crucial for administrators to keep track of these profiles' assignments and ensure they're accurately applied. Additionally, administrators need to be able to identify and resolve any conflicts that may arise between profiles. In this module, students will learn how to use PowerShell scripts within policies to automate actions and execute and monitor them on devices.

After this module, you should be able to:

 -  Monitor the assignments of profiles
 -  Understand how profiles are synchronized and how to manually force synchronization
 -  Use PowerShell to execute and monitor scripts on devices.
