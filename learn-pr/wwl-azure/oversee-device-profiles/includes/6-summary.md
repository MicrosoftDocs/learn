The Intune admin center provides various features to monitor and manage device configuration profiles. These include checking the profile status, viewing assigned devices, and updating profile properties. Administrators can use the Sync device action to ensure devices are up to date with the latest policies and actions to initiate an immediate check-in within Intune. Otherwise, the device's platform determines the default synchronization frequency. Moreover, the Intune management extension allows administrators to run PowerShell scripts, providing other capabilities such as installing legacy Win32 applications on Windows devices.
