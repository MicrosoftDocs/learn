This guided project consists of the four exercises.

 -  Exercise 1: Provision Azure Container Registry (ACR) and Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).
 -  Exercise 2: Build a Linux and Windows container images and store them in Azure Container Registry.
 -  **Exercise 3: Deploy container images to Azure Kubernetes Service.**
 -  Exercise 4: Review the deployment and deprovision all resources.

In Exercise 3, you deploy two container images you created earlier in this lab to the AKS cluster.

 -  **Task 1: Create custom AKS namespaces.** You create two namespaces on the AKS cluster you created in an earlier exercise.
 -  **Task 2: Create a Kubernetes manifest for deploying the Linux image**. You create a Kubernetes manifest for deploying the Linux image to the Linux node pool.
 -  **Task 3: Create a Kubernetes manifest for deploying the Windows image.** You create a Kubernetes manifest for deploying the Windows image to the Windows node pool.
 -  **Task 4: Perform AKS deployments by using YAML manifest files.** You deploy both container images to their namespaces and node pools in the target AKS cluster.
