  questions:
  - content: "Suppose an organization needs to run a network appliance on a virtual machine. Which virtual machine size family is best for this scenario?"
    choices:
    - content: "Compute optimized."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Compute optimized virtual machines are designed to have a high CPU-to-memory ratio. Suitable for medium traffic web servers, network appliances, batch processes, and application servers."
    - content: "Memory optimized."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Memory optimized VMs are designed to have a high memory-to-CPU ratio, which is great for relational database servers, but not as suitable for network appliances."
    - content: "Storage optimized."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Storage optimized VMs are designed to have high disk throughput and IO, which is ideal for VMs running databases but not as suitable for network appliances."
  - content: "What's the composition of an alert rule?"
    choices:
    - content: "Resource, condition, log, alert type."
      isCorrect: false

      explanation: "Correct. These elements make up an alert rule."
  - content: "Which role provides read, write, and delete on Azure storage containers and blobs?"
    choices:
    - content: "Storage Blob Data Reader."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The Storage Blob Data Reader role only provides read and list permissions."
    - content: "Storage Blob Data Contributor."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The Storage Blob Data Contributor role provides read, write, and delete permissions."
    - content: "Storage Blob Delegator."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The Storage Blob Delegator role provides a user delegation key, which can then be used to create a shared access signature."
