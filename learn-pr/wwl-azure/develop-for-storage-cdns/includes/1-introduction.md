A content delivery network (CDN) is a distributed network of servers that can efficiently deliver web content to users. CDNs store cached content on edge servers in point-of-presence (POP) locations that are close to end users, to minimize latency.

After completing this module, you'll be able to:

* Explain how the Azure Content Delivery Network works and how it can improve the user experience.
* Control caching behavior and purge content.
* Perform actions on Azure CDN by using the Azure CDN Library for .NET.
