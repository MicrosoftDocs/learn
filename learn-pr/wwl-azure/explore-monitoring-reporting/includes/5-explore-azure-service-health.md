[Azure Service Health](https://azure.microsoft.com/features/service-health?azure-portal=true) is a suite of experiences that provide personalized guidance and support when issues with Azure services affect you. It can notify you, help you understand the impact of issues, and keep you updated as the issue is resolved. Azure Service Health can also help you prepare for planned maintenance and changes that could affect the availability of your resources.

Azure Service Health is composed of the following:

+ [**Azure Status**](https://status.azure.com) provides a global view of the health state of Azure services. With Azure Status, you can get up-to-the-minute information on service availability. Everyone has access to Azure Status and can view all services that report their health state.

+ [**Service Health**](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Health/AzureHealthBrowseBlade) provides you with a customizable dashboard that tracks the state of your Azure services in the regions where you use them. In this dashboard, you can track active events such as ongoing service issues, upcoming planned maintenance, or relevant *Health advisories*. When events become inactive, they are placed in your *Health history* for up to 90 days. Finally, you can use the **Service Health** dashboard to create and manage service *Health alerts*, which notify you whenever there are service issues that affect you.

+ **Resource Health** helps you diagnose and obtain support when an Azure service issue affects your resources. It provides you details with about the current and past state of your resources. It also provides technical support to help you mitigate problems. In contrast to Azure Status, which informs you about service problems that affect a broad set of Azure customers, Resource Health gives you a personalized dashboard of your resources' health. Resource Health shows you times, in the past, when your resources were unavailable because of Azure service problems. It's then easier for you to understand if an SLA was violated.


Together, the Azure Service Health components provide you with a comprehensive view of the health status of Azure, at the level of granularity that is most relevant to you.
