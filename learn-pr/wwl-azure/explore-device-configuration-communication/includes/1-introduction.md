Azure IoT Hub can connect to thousands of IoT devices using a combination of device-side coding and service configuration.

Suppose you have joined a team that will be implementing an Azure IoT solution for the company. IoT Hub supports several device communication protocols that can be configured to meet business requirements and ensure secure communications between device and cloud. You decide to examine the supported communication protocols and device communication coding techniques, and then explore your ability to implement device communication in a test environment.

In this module, you will:

 -  Review the types of device communication and communication protocols.
 -  Examine the device-side code used to implement device communication.
 -  Complete a lab activity that includes registering a device with IoT Hub, and then configuring and testing device communication to IoT Hub.

By the end of this module, you will be able to connect an IoT device to Azure IoT Hub and verify device communication.
