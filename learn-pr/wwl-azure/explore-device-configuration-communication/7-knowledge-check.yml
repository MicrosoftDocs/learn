  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "A company will be implementing an IoT solution that uses both IoT devices and IoT Edge devices, and they expect to process a little over 5 million messages per day. The company wants to minimize their cost. What IoT Hub tier and edition should they select and how many units will be required?"
    choices:
    - content: "B1 with 8 units."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A Basic tier B1 edition IoT Hub with 8 units would provide a low cost, but could only process 3.2 million messages per day and is restricted to IoT devices only."
    - content: "B2 with 1 unit."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A Basic tier B2 edition IoT Hub with 1 unit would provide a cost savings over an S2 IoT Hub and could process 6 million messages per day, but would not support connections to IoT Edge devices."
    - content: "S2 with 1 unit."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. A Standard tier S2 edition IoT Hub will process 6 million messages per day and support both IoT devices and IoT Edge devices."
  - content: "Which of the following statements about Device Twins is correct?"
    choices:
    - content: "Each device that is registered with IoT Hub has a Device Twin."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. When a device is registered with IoT Hub, IoT Hub assigns a Device Twin with default contents."
    - content: "Device twins are XAML documents maintained by IoT Hub."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Device twins are JSON documents maintained by IoT Hub."
    - content: "When you disable a device, the device twin is deleted."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The device twin is maintained when a device is disabled and will be available if the device is re-enabled."
  - content: "A company is investigating how to implement 2-way communication between devices and IoT Hub. Which of the following answers is a common example of sending information from devices to the cloud?"
    choices:
    - content: "Device-to-cloud messages for scheduling firmware updates."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. It is unlikely that a device would send a message to the cloud to schedule a firmware update."
    - content: "Device twin's reported properties for reporting device state information."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The device could send the device twin's reported properties for reporting device state information."
    - content: "Device twin's proposed properties for requesting device state information."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A device does not set the device twin's reported properties."
