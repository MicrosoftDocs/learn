## Exercise - Access Azure Preview features

In this walkthrough, we will access and identify Azure preview services and features, and view information about the latest Azure updates.

## Task 1: Access preview services and features

In this task, we will review Marketplace Preview features. 

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com?azure-portal=true).

2. From the **All services** blade, search for and select **Marketplace**. 

3. Search the Marketplace for **Preview**. Review any preview products that interest you. 

4. Search the Marketplace for **Kubernetes Service**. Select the Kubernetes Service, and click **Create**.

5. In the **Kubernetes Version** drop-down notice there is a **Preview** version. Not all services will have a version in preview.

    > [!NOTE]
    > In these scenarios, where new functionality or features are made available within an existing generally available Azure service or product, although you may be using the Azure service in production, the preview feature or functionality may not yet be ready for production deployments. You should make sure you are aware of any limitations around the use of preview versions before deploying them into production.



## Task 2: Review the Azure Updates page

In this task, we will review the Azure Updates page.

1. In a browser, navigate to the [Azure Updates](https://azure.microsoft.com/updates?azure-portal=true) page.

2. You will see several different status based filter options named **Now Available**, **In preview** and **In development**

3. Enable the **In preview** checkbox, type **Kubernetes** in the Keyword search textbox, and press the **Enter** key. 
    > [!NOTE]
    > The page returns a list of items in preview related to Kubernetes. Your result list may be different.
