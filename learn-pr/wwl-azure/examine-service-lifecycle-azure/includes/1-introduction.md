Azure services have a lifecycle.  Azure services start in the development phase. Next they are released to preview, to inform you new features are coming. Then the services release to public testing, so you can experiment with them.  Finally the service becomes available to everyone.  Services Lifecycle in Azure is the name of this release cycle.  Over the next few minutes we'll explore the value of service lifecycles.

> ### Contoso Shipping case study
>
> Contoso Shipping is experimenting with a custom drone delivery system for rural areas.  They really want the ability to use some real-time storm tracking in the guidance system, but the feature is not ready yet.  The Azure Blog says that a AI Storm Analyzer has just entered preview.  How can Contoso Shipping see if this might be the capability they need.

In this module, you'll define what a preview feature is, and explore how and when you should use it.
