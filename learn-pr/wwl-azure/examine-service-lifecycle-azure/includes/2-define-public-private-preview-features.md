Microsoft offers previews of Azure services, features, and functionality for evaluation purposes.  With *Azure Previews*, you can test pre-release features, products, services, software, and even regions. Previews allow users early access to functionality.  Additionally, users providing feedback on the preview features helps Microsoft improve the Azure service.

## Categories

There are two categories of preview that are available:

+ **Private preview** - An Azure feature is available to *certain* Azure customers for evaluation purposes.

+ **Public preview** - An Azure feature is available to *all* Azure customers for evaluation purposes.

## Azure Preview Terms and Conditions

Azure feature previews are available with their own terms and conditions.  The terms and conditions are specific to each Azure preview. All preview-specific terms and conditions supplement your existing Azure service agreement.
