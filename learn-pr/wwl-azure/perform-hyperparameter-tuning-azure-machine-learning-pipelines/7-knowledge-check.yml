  questions:
  - content: "You plan to use hyperparameter tuning to find optimal discrete values for a set of hyperparameters. You want to try every possible combination of a set of specified discrete values. Which kind of sampling should you use?"
    choices:
    - content: "Random sampling"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. You should use grid sampling to try every combination of discrete hyperparameter values."
    - content: "Grid sampling"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. You should use grid sampling to try every combination of discrete hyperparameter values."
    - content: "Bayesian sampling"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. You should use grid sampling to try every combination of discrete hyperparameter values."
  - content: "You're using hyperparameter tuning to train an optimal model based on a target metric named \"AUC\". What should you do in your training script?"
    choices:
    - content: "Import the logging package and use a logging.info() statement to log the AUC."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Your script needs to use MLflow to log the primary metric to the run using the same name as specified in the sweep job."
    - content: "Include a print() statement to write the AUC value to the standard output stream."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Your script needs to use MLflow to log the primary metric to the run using the same name as specified in the sweep job."
    - content: "Use a mlflow.log_metric() statement to log the AUC value."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Your script needs to use MLflow to log the primary metric to the run using the same name as specified in the sweep job."
