The set of hyperparameter values tried during hyperparameter tuning is known as the **search space**. The definition of the range of possible values that can be chosen depends on the type of hyperparameter.

## Discrete hyperparameters

Some hyperparameters require *discrete* values - in other words, you must select the value from a particular *finite* set of possibilities. You can define a search space for a discrete parameter using a **Choice** from a list of explicit values, which you can define as a Python **list** (`Choice(values=[10,20,30])`), a **range** (`Choice(values=range(1,10))`), or an arbitrary set of comma-separated values (`Choice(values=(30,50,100))`)

You can also select discrete values from any of the following discrete distributions:

- `QUniform(min_value, max_value, q)`: Returns a value like round(Uniform(min_value, max_value) / q) * q
- `QLogUniform(min_value, max_value, q)`: Returns a value like round(exp(Uniform(min_value, max_value)) / q) * q
- `QNormal(mu, sigma, q)`: Returns a value like round(Normal(mu, sigma) / q) * q
- `QLogNormal(mu, sigma, q)`: Returns a value like round(exp(Normal(mu, sigma)) / q) * q

## Continuous hyperparameters

Some hyperparameters are *continuous* - in other words you can use any value along a scale, resulting in an *infinite* number of possibilities. To define a search space for these kinds of value, you can use any of the following distribution types:

- `Uniform(min_value, max_value)`: Returns a value uniformly distributed between min_value and max_value
- `LogUniform(min_value, max_value)`: Returns a value drawn according to exp(Uniform(min_value, max_value)) so that the logarithm of the return value is uniformly distributed
- `Normal(mu, sigma)`: Returns a real value that's normally distributed with mean mu and standard deviation sigma
- `LogNormal(mu, sigma)`: Returns a value drawn according to exp(Normal(mu, sigma)) so that the logarithm of the return value is normally distributed

## Defining a search space

To define a search space for hyperparameter tuning, create a dictionary with the appropriate parameter expression for each named hyperparameter.  

For example, the following search space indicates that the `batch_size` hyperparameter can have the value 16, 32, or 64, and the `learning_rate` hyperparameter can have any value from a normal distribution with a mean of 10 and a standard deviation of 3.

```python
from azure.ai.ml.sweep import Choice, Normal

command_job_for_sweep = job(
    batch_size=Choice(values=[16, 32, 64]),    
    learning_rate=Normal(mu=10, sigma=3),
)
```
