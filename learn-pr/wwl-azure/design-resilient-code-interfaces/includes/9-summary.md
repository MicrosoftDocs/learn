In this module, you learned how interfaces contribute to building resilient and maintainable code. You explored how to implement explicit interface members, combine multiple interfaces, and reduce code dependencies using interfaces.

After completing this module, you're now able to:

- Apply coding design standards to your C# projects.
- Provide specific implementations for explicit interface members in a class.
- Use and combine multiple interfaces to create flexible and modular designs.
- Reduce code dependencies with interfaces to enhance maintainability and testability.
- Build resilient code by using the power of interfaces.
