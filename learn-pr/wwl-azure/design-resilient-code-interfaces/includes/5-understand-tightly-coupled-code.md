Tightly coupled code occurs when components are overly dependent on each other's implementation details. The dependency can make your code harder to maintain, less flexible, and more prone to bugs. A common solution is to use **interfaces** to decouple components and improve modularity.

In your role as a software developer, you encounter the challenges of tightly coupled code in where there's a direct dependency. You apply the **Open/Closed Principle** to address decoupling your code for building a more maintainable system.

## Tightly coupled code

Tightly coupled code refers to a situation where one component is heavily reliant on the internal details of another. This creates a rigid system that is difficult to modify or extend without breaking existing functionality.

## Direct dependency example

Consider a `Library` class that directly interacts with a `BorrowableBook` class. The `Library` class depends on the specific implementation of `BorrowableBook` to perform borrowing operations.

```csharp
public class BorrowableBook
{
    public string Title { get; set; }
    public bool IsAvailable { get; private set; } = true;

    public BorrowableBook(string title)
    {
        Title = title;
    }

    public void Borrow()
    {
        if (IsAvailable)
        {
            IsAvailable = false;
            Console.WriteLine($"You have borrowed \"{Title}\".");
        }
        else
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"\"{Title}\" is already borrowed.");
        }
    }
}

public class Library
{
    private BorrowableBook _book;

    public Library(BorrowableBook book)
    {
        _book = book;
    }

    public void BorrowBook()
    {
        if (_book.IsAvailable)
        {
            _book.Borrow();
        }
        else
        {
            Console.WriteLine("The book is not available.");
        }
    }
}
```

In this code, the `Library` class depends directly on the `BorrowableBook` class. While the dependency works for a single type of borrowable item, it introduces two key issues:

- **Direct Dependency**: The `Library` class is tightly coupled to the `BorrowableBook` type. If you want to add new borrowable items (for example, DVDs, magazines), you would need to modify the `Library` class.
- **Limited Extensibility**: The current design makes it difficult to extend functionality without changing existing code.

This tight coupling violates the **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**, which states that software should be **open for extension but closed for modification**. In other words, you should be able to add new features without altering existing code.

By reducing dependencies, you can:
- **Improve Maintainability**: Changes in one part of the system are less likely to affect others.
- **Enhance Flexibility**: New features can be added without modifying existing code.
- **Simplify Testing**: Components can be tested independently.

To address the issue, you need to refactor the code using interfaces to make it more modular and flexible.
