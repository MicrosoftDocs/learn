Interfaces in C#/.NET programming are essential for creating resilient and maintainable code by reducing dependencies and enabling flexible design.

In this module, you explore advanced concepts of interfaces in C#. You learn how to implement explicit interface members, combine multiple interfaces, and reduce code dependencies using interfaces.

## Learning objectives

- Apply SOLID design principles.
- Implement explicit interface members in a class.
- Use and combine multiple interfaces.
- Reduce code dependencies with interfaces.
- Build resilient code with interfaces.

## Prerequisites

- Visual Studio Code installed with the C# Dev Kit
- Basic knowledge of the Visual Studio Code IDE
- Basic understanding of the C# programming language
- Able to create and implement basic interfaces
- Familiar with classes, abstract classes, and inheritance
