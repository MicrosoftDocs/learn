This module covers the topic of configuring user rights in Active Directory. It emphasizes the principle of least privilege, which is a crucial aspect of maintaining secure systems.

## Scenario

This involves understanding and implementing user rights assignment policies, managing account security options, and ensuring that the principle of least privilege is followed.
