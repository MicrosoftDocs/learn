Event Grid provides durable delivery. It tries to deliver each event at least once for each matching subscription immediately. If a subscriber's endpoint doesn't acknowledge receipt of an event or if there's a failure, Event Grid retries delivery based on a fixed retry schedule and retry policy. By default, Event Grid delivers one event at a time to the subscriber, and the payload is an array with a single event.

> [!NOTE]
> Event Grid doesn't guarantee order for event delivery, so subscribers might receive them out of order.

## Retry schedule

When Event Grid receives an error for an event delivery attempt, Event Grid decides whether it should: retry the delivery, dead-letter the event, or drop the event based on the type of the error.

If the error returned by the subscribed endpoint is a configuration-related error that can't be fixed with retries, Event Grid will either: perform dead-lettering on the event, or drop the event if dead-letter isn't configured.

The following table describes the types of endpoints and errors for which retry doesn't happen:

| Endpoint Type | Error codes |
|--|--|
| Azure Resources | 400 (Bad request), 413 (Request entity is too large) |
| Webhook | 400 (Bad request), 413 (Request entity is too large), 401 (Unauthorized) |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If Dead-Letter isn't configured for an endpoint, events are dropped when the above errors happen. Consider configuring Dead-Letter if you don't want these kinds of events to be dropped.

If the error returned by the subscribed endpoint isn't among the previous list, Event Grid waits 30 seconds for a response after delivering a message. After 30 seconds, if the endpoint fails to responded, the message is queued for retry. Event Grid uses an exponential backoff retry policy for event delivery. 

If the endpoint responds within 3 minutes, Event Grid attempts to remove the event from the retry queue on a best effort basis but duplicates might still be received. Event Grid adds a small randomization to all retry steps and might opportunistically skip certain retries if an endpoint is consistently unhealthy, down for a long period, or appears to be overwhelmed.

## Retry policy

You can customize the retry policy when creating an event subscription by using the following two configurations. An event is dropped if either of the limits of the retry policy is reached.

* **Maximum number of attempts** - The value must be an integer between 1 and 30. The default value is 30.
* **Event time-to-live (TTL)** -  The value must be an integer between 1 and 1440. The default value is 1440 minutes

The following example shows setting the maximum number of attempts to 18 by using the Azure CLI.

```bash
az eventgrid event-subscription create \
  -g gridResourceGroup \
  --topic-name <topic_name> \
  --name <event_subscription_name> \
  --endpoint <endpoint_URL> \
  --max-delivery-attempts 18
```

## Output batching

You can configure Event Grid to batch events for delivery for improved HTTP performance in high-throughput scenarios. Batching is turned off by default and can be turned on by subscription via the portal, CLI, PowerShell, or SDKs. 

Batched delivery has two settings:

* **Max events per batch** - Maximum number of events Event Grid delivers per batch. This number won't be exceeded, however fewer events might be delivered if no other events are available at the time of publish. Event Grid doesn't delay events to create a batch if fewer events are available. Must be between 1 and 5,000.

* **Preferred batch size in kilobytes** - Target ceiling for batch size in kilobytes. Similar to max events, the batch size might be smaller if more events aren't available at the time of publish. It's possible that a batch is larger than the preferred batch size *if* a single event is larger than the preferred size. For example, if the preferred size is 4 KB and a 10-KB event is pushed to Event Grid, the 10-KB event is delivered in its own batch rather than being dropped.

## Delayed delivery

As an endpoint experiences delivery failures, Event Grid begins to delay the delivery and retry of events to that endpoint. For example, if the first 10 events published to an endpoint fail, Event Grid assumes that the endpoint is experiencing issues and delays all subsequent retries, and new deliveries, for some time - in some cases up to several hours.

The functional purpose of delayed delivery is to protect unhealthy endpoints and the Event Grid system. Without back-off and delay of delivery to unhealthy endpoints, Event Grid's retry policy and volume capabilities can easily overwhelm a system.

## Dead-letter events

When Event Grid can't deliver an event within a certain time period or after trying to deliver the event a specific number of times, it can send the undelivered event to a storage account. This process is known as **dead-lettering**. Event Grid dead-letters an event when **one of the following** conditions is met.

* Event isn't delivered within the **time-to-live** period.
* The **number of tries** to deliver the event exceeds the limit.

If either of the conditions is met, the event is dropped or dead-lettered. By default, Event Grid doesn't turn on dead-lettering. To enable it, you must specify a storage account to hold undelivered events when creating the event subscription. You pull events from this storage account to resolve deliveries.

If Event Grid receives a 400 (Bad Request) or 413 (Request Entity Too Large) response code, it immediately schedules the event for dead-lettering. These response codes indicate delivery of the event failed.

There's a five-minute delay between the last attempt to deliver an event and delivery to the dead-letter location. This delay is intended to reduce the number of Blob storage operations. If the dead-letter location is unavailable for four hours, the event is dropped.

## Custom delivery properties

Event subscriptions allow you to set up HTTP headers that are included in delivered events. This capability allows you to set custom headers that are required by a destination. You can set up to 10 headers when creating an event subscription. Each header value shouldn't be greater than 4,096 bytes. You can set custom headers on the events that are delivered to the following destinations:

* Webhooks
* Azure Service Bus topics and queues
* Azure Event Hubs
* Relay Hybrid Connections

Before setting the dead-letter location, you must have a storage account with a container. You provide the endpoint for this container when creating the event subscription.
