Azure Event Grid allows you to control the level of access given to different users to do various management operations such as list event subscriptions, create new ones, and generate keys. Event Grid uses Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC).

## Built-in roles

Event Grid provides the following built-in roles:

| Role | Description |
|--|--|
| Event Grid Subscription Reader | Lets you read Event Grid event subscriptions. |
| Event Grid Subscription Contributor | Lets you manage Event Grid event subscription operations. |
| Event Grid Contributor | Lets you create and manage Event Grid resources. |
| Event Grid Data Sender | Lets you send events to Event Grid topics. |

The Event Grid Subscription Reader and Event Grid Subscription Contributor roles are for managing event subscriptions. They're important when implementing event domains because they give users the permissions they need to subscribe to topics in your event domain. These roles are focused on event subscriptions and don't grant access for actions such as creating topics.

The Event Grid Contributor role allows you to create and manage Event Grid resources.

## Permissions for event subscriptions

If you're using an event handler that isn't a WebHook (such as an event hub or queue storage), you need write access to that resource. This permissions check prevents an unauthorized user from sending events to your resource.

You must have the **Microsoft.EventGrid/EventSubscriptions/Write** permission on the resource that is the event source. You need this permission because you're writing a new subscription at the scope of the resource. The required resource differs based on whether you're subscribing to a system topic or custom topic. Both types are described in this section.

| Topic Type | Description |
|--|--|
| System topics | Need permission to write a new event subscription at the scope of the resource publishing the event. The format of the resource is: `/subscriptions/{subscription-id}/resourceGroups/{resource-group-name}/providers/{resource-provider}/{resource-type}/{resource-name}` |
| Custom topics | Need permission to write a new event subscription at the scope of the Event Grid topic. The format of the resource is: `/subscriptions/{subscription-id}/resourceGroups/{resource-group-name}/providers/Microsoft.EventGrid/topics/{topic-name}` |
