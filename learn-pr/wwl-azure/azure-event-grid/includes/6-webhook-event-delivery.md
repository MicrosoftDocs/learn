Webhooks are one of the many ways to receive events from Azure Event Grid. When a new event is ready, Event Grid service POSTs an HTTP request to the configured endpoint with the event in the request body.

Like many other services that support webhooks, Event Grid requires you to prove ownership of your Webhook endpoint before it starts delivering events to that endpoint. This requirement prevents a malicious user from flooding your endpoint with events.

When you use any of the following three Azure services, the Azure infrastructure automatically handles this validation:

* Azure Logic Apps with Event Grid Connector
* Azure Automation via webhook
* Azure Functions with Event Grid Trigger

## Endpoint validation with Event Grid events

If you're using any other type of endpoint, such as an HTTP trigger based Azure function, your endpoint code needs to participate in a validation handshake with Event Grid. Event Grid supports two ways of validating the subscription.

* **Synchronous handshake**: At the time of event subscription creation, Event Grid sends a subscription validation event to your endpoint. The schema of this event is similar to any other Event Grid event. The data portion of this event includes a `validationCode` property. Your application verifies that the validation request is for an expected event subscription, and returns the validation code in the response synchronously. This handshake mechanism is supported in all Event Grid versions.

* **Asynchronous handshake**: In certain cases, you can't return the ValidationCode in response synchronously. For example, if you use a third-party service (like [Zapier](https://zapier.com/) or [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/)), you can't programmatically respond with the validation code.

Starting with version 2018-05-01-preview, Event Grid supports a manual validation handshake. If you're creating an event subscription with an SDK or tool that uses API version 2018-05-01-preview or later, Event Grid sends a `validationUrl` property in the data portion of the subscription validation event. To complete the handshake, find that URL in the event data and do a GET request to it. You can use either a REST client or your web browser.

The provided URL is valid for **5 minutes**. During that time, the provisioning state of the event subscription is `AwaitingManualAction`. If you don't complete the manual validation within 5 minutes, the provisioning state is set to `Failed`. You have to create the event subscription again before starting the manual validation.

This authentication mechanism also requires the webhook endpoint to return an HTTP status code of 200 so that it knows that the POST for the validation event was accepted before it can be put in the manual validation mode. In other words, if the endpoint returns 200 but doesn't return back a validation response synchronously, the mode is transitioned to the manual validation mode. If there's a GET on the validation URL within 5 minutes, the validation handshake is considered to be successful.
