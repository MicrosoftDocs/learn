Azure Event Grid is deeply integrated with Azure services and can be integrated with third-party services. It simplifies event consumption and lowers costs by eliminating the need for constant polling. Event Grid efficiently and reliably routes events from Azure and non-Azure resources, and distributes the events to registered subscriber endpoints.

After completing this module, you'll be able to:

* Describe how Event Grid operates and how it connects to services and event handlers.
* Explain how Event Grid delivers events and how it handles errors. 
* Implement authentication and authorization.
* Route events to a custom endpoint.
