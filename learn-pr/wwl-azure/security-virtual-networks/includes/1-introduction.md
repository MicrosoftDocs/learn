This module is designed to provide administrators with the knowledge and skills needed to plan and implement robust security measures for Azure virtual networks, ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of network resources.

## Scenario

Imagine you are an Azure network security specialist responsible for protecting the virtual networks in your organization's cloud environment. Your organization relies on Azure services and needs a comprehensive understanding of network security, from Network Security Groups (NSGs) to encryption over ExpressRoute.

## Learning objectives

By the end of this module, participants will be able to:

 -  Plan and implement security measures for virtual networks in Azure to protect data and resources.
 -  Effectively use Network Security Groups (NSGs) and Application Security Groups (ASGs) to secure network traffic.
 -  Create and manage user-defined routes (UDRs) to optimize network traffic routing.
 -  Establish Virtual Network peering or VPN gateways for secure network connectivity.
 -  Plan and implement Virtual WAN, including secured virtual hubs, for optimized network management.
 -  Secure VPN connectivity, including point-to-site and site-to-site configurations, for remote access and branch connectivity.
 -  Implement encryption over ExpressRoute to ensure data privacy and integrity.
 -  Configure firewall settings on Platform as a Service (PaaS) resources to control inbound and outbound traffic.
 -  Monitor network security effectively using Network Watcher, including NSG flow logging for threat detection and analysis.

## Goals

The module aims to equip participants with the knowledge and expertise necessary to design, implement, and maintain a highly secure virtual network environment in Azure. Participants will be able to protect sensitive data, applications, and resources from potential threats and vulnerabilities while maintaining network integrity and availability.
