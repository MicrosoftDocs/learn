    - content: "To collect and send security logs to a Log Analytics workspace"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Configuring a Log Analytics agent in Defender for Cloud allows organizations to collect and send security logs from various sources, such as virtual machines and Azure services, to a Log Analytics workspace. This enables centralized storage and analysis of security logs for threat detection and incident response."
    - content: "To manage virtual machine resources in Azure"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Virtual machine management is not the primary function of a Log Analytics agent."
  - content: "Which tool is used to configure and manage the Log Analytics agent in Defender for Cloud?"
    choices:
    - content: "Microsoft Sentinel"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Microsoft Sentinel - Microsoft Sentinel is a cloud-native security information and event management (SIEM) service that can integrate with Log Analytics, but it is not used for configuring the Log Analytics agent."

      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Azure Log Analytics - Azure Log Analytics provides the tools and capabilities to configure and manage the Log Analytics agent in Defender for Cloud. It allows organizations to set up and manage data collection, query logs, and configure alerts and notifications."
    - content: "Azure Monitor"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Azure Monitor - Azure Monitor focuses on monitoring and managing the performance and availability of Azure resources, not specifically configuring the Log Analytics agent."
  - content: "What types of data sources can be integrated with the Log Analytics agent in Defender for Cloud?"
    choices:
    - content: "Application code repositories"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Application code repositories are typically managed and versioned in source code management tools like Azure DevOps or GitHub, not integrated with the Log Analytics agent."
    - content: "Security event logs"
