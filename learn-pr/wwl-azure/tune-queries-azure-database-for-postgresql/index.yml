  title: Tune queries in Azure Database for PostgreSQL
  description: "Relational databases store many different types of data for many different types of applications. Some databases have thousands of users and some have just one user. Some tables have tens of rows while others have millions of rows. Some data is unique while other data is duplicated. All of these variables mean that database management systems (DBMSs) need systems to understand the data and the queries that are running against this data to ensure optimum performance. When you are performance tuning a database, it is important to understand how performance tuning works and how you can assess performance metrics."
