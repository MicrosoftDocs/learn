In this module, we explore the most recent developments from the Microsoft and SAP partnership and how they help customers accelerate their business transformation. 

## Joint AI integration between Microsoft 365 Copilot and SAP Joule

Microsoft and SAP are expanding our partnership by bringing Joule together with Microsoft Copilot into a unified experience. The combination allows employees to get more done in the flow of their work through seamless access to information from business applications in SAP and Microsoft 365.  

Customers want AI assistants to carry out requests regardless of data location or the system that needs to be accessed. By integrating Joule and Microsoft 365 Copilot, the generative AI solutions interact intuitively so users can find information faster and execute tasks without leaving the platform they're already in. 

A user in Microsoft 365 Copilot utilizes SAP Joule to access information stored in SAP for example S/4HANA Cloud, SAP SuccessFactors, or SAP Concur. Similarly, someone using SAP Joule in an SAP application is able to use Microsoft 365 Copilot capabilities without context switching.
