## Azure DevOps

[DevOps](https://azure.microsoft.com/solutions/devops?azure-portal=true) (Development and Operations) brings together people, processes, and technology, automating software delivery to provide continuous value to your users. Azure DevOps Services allows you to create, build, and release pipelines that provide continuous integration, delivery, and deployment for your applications. You can integrate repositories and application tests, perform application monitoring, and work with build artifacts. You can also work with backlog items for tracking, automate infrastructure deployment, and integrate a range of third-party tools and services such as Jenkins and Chef. All these functions and many more are closely integrated with Azure to allow for consistent, repeatable deployments for your applications to provide streamlined build and release processes.

Some of the main DevOps services available with Azure are Azure DevOps Services, and Azure DevTest Labs.

[Lab Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/devtest-lab?azure-portal=true) is a service that helps developers and testers quickly create environments in Azure, while minimizing waste and controlling cost. Users can test their latest application versions by quickly provisioning Windows and Linux environments using reusable templates and artifacts. You can easily integrate your deployment pipeline with DevTest Labs to provision on-demand environments. With DevTest Labs you can scale up your load testing by provisioning multiple test agents and create pre-provisioned environments for training and demos. Lab Services was formerly known as DevOps Test.
