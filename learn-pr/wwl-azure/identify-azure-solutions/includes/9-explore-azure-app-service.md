## Azure App Service

With [Azure App Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/app-service?azure-portal=true) you can quickly and easily build web and mobile apps for any platform or device. Azure App Service enables you to build and host web apps, mobile back ends, and RESTful APIs in the programming language of your choice without managing infrastructure. It offers auto-scaling and high availability, supports both Windows and Linux, and enables automated deployments from GitHub, Azure DevOps, or any Git repo.

## Key features of Azure App Service

+ **Multiple languages and frameworks**. App Service has first-class support for ASP.NET, ASP.NET Core, Java, Ruby, Node.js, PHP, or Python. You can also run PowerShell and other scripts or executables as background services.

+ **DevOps optimization**. Set up continuous integration and deployment with Azure DevOps, GitHub, BitBucket, Docker Hub, or Azure Container Registry. Promote updates through test and staging environments. Manage your apps in App Service by using Azure PowerShell or the cross-platform command-line interface (CLI).

+ **Global scale with high availability**. Scale up or out manually or automatically. Host your apps anywhere in Microsoft's global datacenter infrastructure, and the App Service SLA promises high availability.

+ **Connections to SaaS platforms and on-premises data**. Choose from more than 50 connectors for enterprise systems (such as SAP), SaaS services (such as Salesforce), and internet services (such as Facebook). Access on-premises data using Hybrid Connections and Azure Virtual Networks.

+ **Security and compliance**. App Service is ISO, SOC, and PCI compliant. Authenticate users with Azure Active Directory or with social login (Google, Facebook, Twitter, and Microsoft). Create IP address restrictions and manage service identities.

+ **Application templates**. Choose from an extensive list of application templates in the Azure Marketplace, such as WordPress, Joomla, and Drupal.

+ **Visual Studio integration**. Dedicated tools in Visual Studio streamline the work of creating, deploying, and debugging.

+ **API and mobile features**. App Service provides turn-key CORS support for RESTful API scenarios, and simplifies mobile app scenarios by enabling authentication, offline data sync, push notifications, and more.

+ **Serverless code**. Run a code snippet or script on-demand without having to explicitly provision or manage infrastructure, and pay only for the compute time your code actually uses.
