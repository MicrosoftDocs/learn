Suppose you work as a software director at a banking institution. The banking institution has decided to adopt Azure DevOps as their primary software development platform. You have several development teams working on different projects and applications, and you need a secure project and repository structure that will allow each team to work independently in some projects, and collaborate in others, while ensuring that their code is secure and meets cybersecurity and banking regulations.

This module shows you how to create and organize a secure project and repository structure, assign access and permissions, separate a project into team projects and repositories, separate secure files between projects, and move the security repository away from a project. Once you know the possible structures you can apply, you’ll be able to configure a project and repository structure that adapts to your business structure and needs and supports secure pipelines.

By the end of this module, you’ll be able to configure a secure project and repository structure in Azure DevOps to support secure pipelines.

After completing this module, you’ll be able to:

- Separate a project into team projects and repositories
- Separate secure files between projects
- Move the security repository away from a project
- Assign project and repositories permissions
- Organize a project and repository structure

### Prerequisites

You must create an Azure DevOps Organization and a Team Project for some exercises. If you don't have them yet, see:

- [Create an organization - Azure DevOps.](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/devops/organizations/accounts/create-organization)
- [Create a project in Azure DevOps.](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/devops/organizations/projects/create-project)

To get the most out of this course, we recommend that you understand Azure DevOps and pipeline management.

For study recommendations, see:

- [Configure secure access to pipeline resources - Introduction.](/training/modules/configure-secure-access-pipeline-resources/1-introduction)

Ensure you have all the necessary resources and access to Azure DevOps before starting the course.
