This module is designed to provide administrators with the knowledge and skills required to effectively manage authorization using Microsoft Entra ID, ensuring that users have the appropriate access to resources and data.

## Scenario

Imagine you are an identity and access management specialist responsible for controlling and monitoring access to your organization's resources and data. Your organization relies on Microsoft Entra ID for identity and access management, and you need to configure authorization policies, roles, and permissions to ensure that users have the right level of access while maintaining security.

## Learning objectives

By the end of this module, participants will be able to:

 -  Configure Azure role permissions for management groups, subscriptions, resource groups, and individual resources to control access at various levels.
 -  Assign built-in roles in Microsoft Entra ID and Azure to grant users predefined permissions for specific tasks.
 -  Create and assign custom roles, including Azure roles and Microsoft Entra ID roles, to tailor access control to organizational requirements.
 -  Implement and manage Microsoft Entra Permissions Management to refine access control for Microsoft Entra ID users.
 -  Configure Microsoft Entra Privileged Identity Management (PIM) to manage and monitor privileged access.
 -  Configure role management and access reviews in Microsoft Entra ID to ensure continuous compliance and security.
 -  Implement Conditional Access policies to enforce access conditions based on user behavior and contextual factors.

## Goals

The module aims to equip participants with the knowledge and skills necessary to manage authorization effectively within Microsoft Entra ID and Azure. Participants will learn how to configure roles and permissions, assign privileges, create custom roles, and implement access control policies, ultimately ensuring that users have the right level of access while maintaining security and compliance.
