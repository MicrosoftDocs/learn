Once you've enabled Permissions Management, you can connect it to your Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Platform (GCP) platforms.

## Prerequisites

To enable Permissions Management in your organization:

 -  You must have a Microsoft Entra tenant. If you don't already have one, create a free account.<br>
 -  You must be eligible for or have an active assignment to the Permissions Management Administrator role as a user in that tenant.

## How to enable Permissions Management on your Microsoft Entra tenant

In your browser:

1.  Browse to the Microsoft Entra admin center and sign in to Microsoft Entra ID as a Global Administrator.
2.  If needed, activate the Permissions Management Administrator role in your Microsoft Entra tenant.
3.  In the Azure portal, select Microsoft Entra Permissions Management, then select the link to purchase a license or begin a trial.

## Activate a free trial or paid license

There are two ways to activate a trial or a full product license.

 -  The first way is to go to the Microsoft 365 admin center.<br>
    1.  Sign in as a **Global Administrator** for your tenant.
    2.  Go to Setup and sign up for a Microsoft Entra Permissions Management trial.
    3.  For self-service, Go to the Microsoft 365 portal to sign up for a 45-day free trial or to purchase licenses.
 -  The second way is through Volume Licensing or Enterprise agreements.
     -  If your organization falls under a volume license or enterprise agreement scenario, contact your Microsoft representative.
