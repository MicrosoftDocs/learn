With your cloud motivation in mind, it’s time to consider how you want your business to use Azure’s capabilities.

Microsoft Azure offers three different categories of cloud services. You should know about these categories and what they can mean for your business, even if your IT team will manage the technical details. Keep in mind that your cloud vision may entail products from more than one of these categories.

## Software as a Service

**Software as a Service (SaaS)** connects you to cloud-based apps over the Internet. If you’ve ever used common Internet services such as Outlook or Microsoft Teams, then you’re already familiar with SaaS products. Microsoft's SaaS products are a quick and simple way to rapidly bring your workforce onto cloud-enabled solutions, without a heavy technical lift. Just subscribe to the software and you’re on the cloud!

**Example**: For a real example of a company adopting SaaS solutions, [read all about how Malaysian healthcare company TMC Life Sciences Berhad employed cloud-based software](https://customers.microsoft.com/story/1485915283441941549-tmc-life-sciences-berhad-health-provider-azure-en-malaysia) to adapt to the COVID-19 pandemic and pursue its goal of going paperless. The company used Microsoft Teams, Microsoft 365, and SAP on Azure to enable more seamless collaboration and single sign-on across its workforce.

## Infrastructure as a Service

**Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)** is essentially renting space at Azure’s datacenters to use however you wish. Your business’s IT team will still be responsible for configuring those systems for your data and operations. Microsoft will only be responsible for the maintenance and security of the datacenters, keeping them up and running as your team does their work inside that hardware.

IaaS lets you transition your existing operations to more efficient, secure, and powerful cloud hardware while retaining core digital responsibilities. Your computing operations can expand to new scales and explore new options on more powerful tech. In an urgent situation, IaaS can be a fast way to switch from in-house IT to the cloud, or to quickly move your backup data to secure cloud servers. Just “lift and shift” your existing setups off your own hardware to Azure’s.

**Example**: [Swiss transportation company Planzer’s cloud transition](https://customers.microsoft.com/story/1480535568291163641-planzer-travel-transportation-azure) was very much a “lift and shift” IaaS story. Planzer moved the contents of over 200 servers to Azure, saving money on IT costs and enabling more reliable service.

## Platform as a Service

**Platform as a Service (PaaS)** is a middle ground between SaaS and IaaS. Under a PaaS arrangement, Microsoft Azure provides the hardware and the core digital frameworks your business will use, such as operating systems, databases, and essential software. Your business will be able to run computing activities on top of that digital foundation, with more room to innovate than with a pre-existing SaaS app.

Many of the cloud’s most exciting opportunities lie within Platform as a Service. With PaaS, you can apply the power of the cloud in ways most specific to your business while offloading core digital responsibilities to Microsoft. PaaS operations will take the most effort to set up, but once ready, your business will be ready to rapidly innovate, explore, and expand with Azure’s digital platform tools at the ready.

**Example**: When Covid-19 appeared, [business data company UnlimitedViz](https://customers.microsoft.com/story/1351711806055240475-unlimited-viz-tygraph-partner-professional-services-azure) used an Azure PaaS offering called Cognitive Service for Language to bring language and sentiment analysis to its tyGraph product. Customers were able to use tyGraph’s new capabilities to track their employees’ reactions and actions in response to the pandemic and adapt their business strategies in response.

## Shared Responsibility Model

You probably noticed that each of the categories entailed some IT responsibilities for your business and some responsibilities for Microsoft. This is the Shared Responsibility Model. Software as a Service entails the least IT responsibility for your business, Infrastructure as a Service entails the most, and Platform as a Service lies in between. See the following table for a summary of how responsibility is shared across each category of service.
