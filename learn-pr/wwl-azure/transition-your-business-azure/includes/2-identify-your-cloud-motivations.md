## Key Takeaways

We talk about motivations for moving to the cloud as fitting into three categories:

 -  A **critical business event** is a disruption in your company or industry that compels you to update your IT systems. Azure makes updating your IT arrangements fast and easy, so quickly transitioning to the cloud can be a way to face a critical business event head-on.
 -  A **migration motivation** is wanting your business to do what it already does well, but faster, more efficiently, and at a larger scale.
 -  An **innovation motivation** is wanting to do significant, exciting things in the cloud you couldn’t do before, such as develop new products or pursue a new business strategy.
