  questions:
  - content: "A data scientist wants to use automated machine learning to find the model with the best AUC_weighted metric. Which parameter of the classification function should be configured?"
    choices:
    - content: "`task='AUC_weighted'`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Task is used to specify whether you're training a classification, regression, or forecasting model."
    - content: "`target_column_name='AUC_weighted'`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The target is the column you want to predict."
    - content: "`primary_metric='AUC_weighted'`"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Set the primary metric to the performance score for which you want to optimize the model."
  - content: "A data scientist has preprocessed the training data and wants to use automated machine learning to quickly iterate through various algorithms. The data shouldn't be changed. What should be the featurization mode to train a model without letting automated machine learning make changes to the data?"
    choices:
    - content: "`auto`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Auto will enable automatic featurization."
    - content: "`custom`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Custom will enable custom featurization."
    - content: "`off`"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. If you don't want the data to be preprocessed at all, set featurization to be off."
