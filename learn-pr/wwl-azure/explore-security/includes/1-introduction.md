People are reminded about computer security risks almost every day. Being safe online involves many things. People can be safe in *what* they do with computers. For example, you don't want to visit websites that may cause you harm. Users also want to be safe in *how* they do the various activities on computers. For example, you don't want to store passwords in a file that anyone can read.

In this module, you learn how computer systems are built to keep people safe. By seeing how these safety systems work, people can make better use of them. Developers who program computers need to understand these systems well so they can use the best tools possible.

In this module you explore the following topics:

 -  Identity: How people are recognized in a computer system
    
    
     -  How computer systems recognize people
     -  How computers know what you can and can't do
     -  The blockchain and security
     -  Hackers: How people work to make computers unsafe and what people can do about it.
     -  The importance of good software code
     -  Passwords, the good and the bad
     -  Two-factor authentication as a second line of defense
     -  How biometrics are even better
     -  How hackers use social engineering to steal data

Safety is something for which every computer user needs to be responsible. But programmers and engineers have a big role to play in keeping people safe. In this module you explore how both, working together, can make a safer computing experience for everyone.
