The term "biometric" refers to using a person's body (their biology) as a security tool. One example is a fingerprint. Fingerprints are unique. Law enforcement uses them to identify people because they're hard to copy. Computer scientists have developed tools that can read fingerprints. They can use them to secure computers.

## Beyond Passwords

Passwords used with another tool like a mobile phone are pretty secure. Many computer scientists believe biometrics are even stronger. A lot of devices now use biometrics alone to sign in a user. On your mobile device, you may rely on face ID or a fingerprint to get access.

Modern tools that use this type of identity are advanced. Using a face for ID involves a number of things. For example, these tools may measure the distance between the center of their eyes. It also may examine the shape of their mouth. The size of their forehead may play a factor. All of these pieces of data are used together to identify them.

The use of a fingerprint or face for identification is so strong that it can be used all by itself. Door lock makers, for example, are putting fingerprint readers on their locks. You can use your fingerprint alone to gain access to your house.

## The Future of Biometrics and Programming

As biometric systems get more advanced, using voice or patterns within the eye may be a way to sign in. Computer programmers may have access to these security tools to use in their software. Some companies are making these tools available now.

There are some concerns about the use of biometrics. Privacy is one. A public camera that is able to identify people without their knowledge may violate privacy. Lawmakers are working to ensure that this type of identity is used safely.

Any programmer that uses these tools should let the user know that they're using them. And data should be stored carefully. Users should always have the chance to delete any biometric data. Users also should have the option to sign in to their devices in ways other than using biometrics.
