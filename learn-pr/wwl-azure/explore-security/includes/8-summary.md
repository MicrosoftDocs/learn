In this module you explored the basics of computer and cloud security. You looked at how computers authorize people and give them permissions to do certain things. You explored ways that people can let computers know who they are. You also looked at how people try to make computers unsafe and what can be done about it.

Specifically, in this module you explored the following:

 -  Authentication: the process by which a computer lets a person access it
 -  Authorization: the process by which a computer lets a user do certain things
 -  Single sign on: this lets a user sign in to one service or site and have their authentication pass through to another
 -  Two-factor authentication: another layer of security that keeps a computer safer
 -  Biometrics: as the way to use face, fingerprint, or voice to authenticate a user
 -  Hackers and ways to prevent people from doing bad things on computer systems

With these topics, you discovered the basics of computer security. Programmers need to be aware of each of these. Security should be at the core of all programming. These topics give you a good place to start.
