## Investigate the scope and root cause of security threats

Microsoft Sentinel deep investigation tools help you to understand the scope and find the root cause of a potential security threat. You can choose an entity on the interactive graph to ask interesting questions for a specific entity and drill down into that entity and its connections to get to the root cause of the threat.

## Hunt for security threats by using built-in queries

Use Microsoft Sentinel's powerful hunting search-and-query tools, based on the MITRE framework, which enable you to proactively hunt for security threats across your organization’s data sources before an alert is triggered. Create custom detection rules based on your hunting query. Then, surface those insights as alerts to your security incident responders.

While hunting, create bookmarks to return to interesting events later. Use a bookmark to share an event with others or group events with other correlating events to create a compelling incident for investigation.<br>

## Enhance your threat hunting with notebooks.

Microsoft Sentinel supports Jupyter notebooks in Azure Machine Learning workspaces, including full machine learning, visualization, and data analysis libraries.

Use notebooks in Microsoft Sentinel to extend the scope of what you can do with Microsoft Sentinel data. For example:<br>

 -  Perform analytics that isn't built into Microsoft Sentinel, such as some Python machine learning features.<br>
 -  Create data visualizations that aren't built into Microsoft Sentinel, such as custom timelines and process trees.
 -  Integrate data sources outside of Microsoft Sentinel, such as an on-premises data set.

Notebooks are intended for threat hunters or Tier 2-3 analysts, incident investigators, data scientists, and security researchers. They require a higher learning curve and coding knowledge. They have limited automation support.

Notebooks in Microsoft Sentinel provide:

 -  Queries to both Microsoft Sentinel and external data
 -  Features for data enrichment, investigation, visualization, hunting, machine learning, and big data analytics

Notebooks are best for:

 -  More complex chains of repeatable tasks
 -  Ad-hoc procedural controls
 -  Machine learning and custom analysis

Notebooks support rich Python libraries for manipulating and visualizing data. They're useful for documenting and sharing analysis evidence.

## Download security content from the community.

The Microsoft Sentinel community is a powerful resource for threat detection and automation. Our Microsoft security analysts create and add new workbooks, playbooks, hunting queries, and more. They post these content items to the community for you to use in your environment. Download sample content from the private community GitHub repository to create custom workbooks, hunting queries, notebooks, and playbooks for Microsoft Sentinel.
