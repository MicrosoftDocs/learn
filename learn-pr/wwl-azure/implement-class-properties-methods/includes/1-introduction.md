This module covers the essential aspects of data encapsulation by classes in C#. The content focuses on class properties, property accessors, and methods. It also delves into the accessibility of class members and the use of extension methods.

Imagine you're working at a non-profit company and that you're helping to update some old software. You're part of a team that's creating classes that encapsulate business logic and data. You need to understand how to define classes, create properties, control access to class members, and implement methods. You also need to know how to extend existing types using extension methods. This module will guide you through these concepts and provide practical examples to help you apply them in your work.

The topics covered in this module include:

- Examining class members and the use of properties and methods.
- Creating class properties and property accessors.
- Creating classes that implement automatically implemented properties.
- Restricting access to properties and property accessors using access modifiers.
- Creating class methods and overloaded methods that accept `reference` and `value` type arguments.
- Creating extension methods for a class.
- Exercise: Update a class with properties and methods in C#.

By the end of this module, you'll be able to create and manage classes in C#, control access to class members, implement methods, and extend existing types using extension methods. This knowledge will enable you to develop robust and efficient software applications in C#.
