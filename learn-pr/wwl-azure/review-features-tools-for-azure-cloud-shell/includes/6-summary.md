In this module, you learned about Azure Cloud Shell and its features. The following are the key takeaways:

- Azure Cloud Shell is an interactive, browser-accessible shell for managing Azure resources. It provides the flexibility of choosing the shell experience that best suits the way you work. Linux users can opt for a Bash experience, while Windows users can opt for PowerShell.

- You can access the Cloud Shell in three ways: 
    - Direct link. Open a browser and refer to https://shell.azure.com.
    - Azure portal. Select the Cloud Shell icon on the Azure portal.
    - Code snippets. On Microsoft Learn select the Try It option that displays with the Azure CLI and Azure PowerShell code snippets.

- Cloud Shell offers a browser-accessible, preconfigured shell experience for managing Azure resources without the overhead of installing, versioning, and maintaining a machine yourself.

- Cloud Shell provisions machines on a per-request basis, and as a result, machine state won't persist across sessions. Cloud Shell is built for interactive sessions, and therefore, shells automatically terminate after 20 minutes of shell inactivity.
