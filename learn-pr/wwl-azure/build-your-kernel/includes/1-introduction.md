Semantic Kernel is an open source SDK that allows you to integrate large language models (LLMs) into your own code. Using the Semantic Kernel SDK, you can create intelligent applications that understand and respond to natural language prompts. The possibilities of artificially intelligent (AI) applications are endless, and the Semantic Kernel SDK can help you create AI agents that can automate tasks, provide personalized recommendations, and more.

Suppose you're a developer for Margie's Travel, a global leader in the travel and hospitality industry. You're tasked with creating a personalized AI travel agent. Rather than creating your own language processing model from scratch, you can use the Semantic Kernel to interface with the language model of your choice and create an AI agent that can:

- Understand natural language.
- Provide customized recommendations.
- Book travel accommodations.
- And more!

This module introduces you to the Semantic Kernel SDK. You can learn how the kernel extends functionality by connecting code to LLMs. You can also learn how the SDK can be used to create artificially intelligent agents that can automate custom tasks.
