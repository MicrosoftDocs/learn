  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "What is the primary role of the Semantic Kernel SDK?"
    choices:
    - content: "Semantic Kernel SDK primarily functions as a standalone AI application."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The Semantic Kernel SDK isn't a standalone AI application."
    - content: "Semantic Kernel SDK is exclusively designed for gaming applications."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The Semantic Kernel SDK isn't exclusively designed for gaming applications."
    - content: "Semantic Kernel SDK acts as a bridge between code and large language models."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Semantic Kernel provides a layer for seamless integration with large language models."
  - content: "Which of the following statements is true about the Semantic Kernel SDK?"
    choices:
    - content: "Semantic Kernel SDK adds unnecessary complexity and developers should avoid it."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The Semantic Kernel SDK doesn't add unnecessary complexity."
    - content: "Semantic Kernel SDK uses abstraction to reduce the learning curve of integration AI."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Semantic Kernel SDK eases AI integration by providing abstraction and orchestration."
    - content: "Semantic Kernel SDK is only suitable for advanced AI developers."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The Semantic Kernel SDK is suitable for developers of all levels."
  - content: "How does the Semantic Kernel handle prompts sent to an AI service?"
    choices:
    - content: "It builds the prompt using a provided template and processes the response."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The kernel builds the prompt, sends it to the AI service, receives the response, and parses it before returning it to the application."
    - content: "It selects multiple AI services simultaneously to run the prompt."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The kernel selects the best single AI service to run the prompt."
    - content: "It bypasses the use of templates to streamline the workflow."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The kernel uses provided prompt templates as part of the process."
