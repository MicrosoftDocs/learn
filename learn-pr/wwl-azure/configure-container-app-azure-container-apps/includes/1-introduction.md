Azure Container Apps is a fully managed environment that enables you to run microservices and containerized applications on a serverless platform. It allows you to deploy API endpoints, host background processing jobs, handle event-driven processing, and run microservices. Applications built on Azure Container Apps can dynamically scale based on HTTP traffic, event-driven processing, CPU or memory load, and any KEDA-supported scaler.

## Scenario

Imagine you're a DevOps engineer or developer who needs to deploy a microservice application that can handle event-driven processing. You decide to use Azure Container Apps to deploy your application. With Azure Container Apps, you can easily deploy your application without worrying about managing cloud infrastructure and complex container orchestrators. You can also take advantage of the benefits of running containers, such as dynamic scaling.
