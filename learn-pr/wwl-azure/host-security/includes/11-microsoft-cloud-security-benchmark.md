The **Microsoft cloud security benchmark (MCSB)** provides prescriptive best practices and recommendations to help **improve the security of workloads**, **data**, and **services** on **Azure** and your **multicloud environment**. This benchmark focuses on **cloud-centric control areas** with input from a set of **holistic Microsoft** and **industry security guidance** that includes:

 -  Cloud Adoption Framework: Guidance on **security**, including **strategy**, **roles** and **responsibilities**, **Azure Top 10 Security Best Practices**, and **reference implementation**.
 -  Azure Well-Architected Framework: Guidance on securing your workloads on Azure.
 -  The Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) Workshop: Program guidance and reference strategies to accelerate security modernization using Zero Trust principles.
 -  Other industry and cloud service provider's security best practice standards and framework: Examples include the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Well-Architected Framework, Center for Internet Security (CIS) Controls, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), and Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS).

## Microsoft cloud security benchmark features

**Comprehensive multicloud security framework**: Organizations often have to build an internal security standard to reconcile security controls across multiple cloud platforms to meet security and compliance requirements on each of them. This often requires security teams to repeat the same implementation, monitoring, and assessment across the different cloud environments (**often for different compliance standards**). This creates unnecessary overhead, cost, and effort. To address this concern, we enhanced the **Azure Security Benchmark (ASB)** to the **Microsoft cloud security benchmark (MCSB)** to help you quickly work with different clouds by:

 -  Providing a single control framework to easily meet the security controls across clouds
 -  Providing consistent user experience for monitoring and enforcing the multicloud security benchmark in Defender for Cloud
 -  Staying aligned with Industry Standards (e.g., Center for Internet Security, National Institute of Standards and Technology, Payment Card Industry)

**Automated control monitoring for AWS in Microsoft Defender for Cloud:** You can use **Microsoft Defender for Cloud Regulatory Compliance Dashboard** to monitor your AWS environment against **Microsoft cloud security benchmark (MCSB)**, just like how you monitor your Azure environment. We developed approximately **180 AWS checks** for the new AWS security guidance in MCSB, allowing you to monitor your AWS environment and resources in Microsoft Defender for Cloud.
