## Task 6 - Use SSH to connect to a Linux VM (optional)

> [!NOTE]
> This task requires a Linux VM. Ensure port 22 is open.

In this task, we'll create an SSH private key with PuTTYgen, and then use SSH to connect to a Linux virtual machine.

### Create the SSH Keys

1.  Download the PuTTY tool. This will include PuTTYgen - [https://putty.org/](https://putty.org/).
2.  Once installed, locate and open the **PuTTYgen** program.
3.  In the **Parameters** option group choose **RSA**.
4.  Click the **Generate** button.
5.  Move your mouse around the blank area in the window to generate some randomness.
6.  Copy the text of the **Public key for pasting into authorized keys file**.
7.  Optionally you can specify a **Key passphrase** and then **Confirm passphrase.** You will be prompted for the passphrase when you authenticate to the VM with your private SSH key. Without a passphrase, if someone obtains your private key, they can sign in to any VM or service that uses that key. We recommend you create a passphrase. However, if you forget the passphrase, there is no way to recover it.
8.  Click **Save private key**.
9.  Choose a location and filename and click **Save**. You'll need this file to access the VM.

### Create the Linux machine and assign the public SSH key

1.  In the portal navigate to your Linux machine.
2.  Choose **SSH Public Key** for the **Authentication type** (instead of **Password** ).
3.  Provide a **Username**.
4.  Paste the public SSH key from PuTTY into the **SSH public key** text area. Ensure the key validates with a checkmark.
5.  Create the VM. Wait for it to deploy.
6.  Access the running VM.
7.  From the **Overview** blade, click **Connect**.
8.  Make a note of your login information including user and public IP address.

### Access the server using SSH

1.  Open the **PuTTY** tool.
2.  Enter **username@publicIpAddress** where username is the value you assigned when creating the VM and publicIpAddress is the value you obtained from the Azure portal.
3.  Specify **22** for the **Port**.
4.  Choose **SSH** in the **Connection Type** option group.
5.  Navigate to **SSH** in the Category panel, then click **Auth**.
6.  Click the **Browse** button next to **Private key file for authentication**.
7.  Navigate to the private key file saved when you generated the SSH keys and click **Open**.
