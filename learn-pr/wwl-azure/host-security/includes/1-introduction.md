Once you have your network and perimeter secure, you need to lock down the host machines where your applications run. Installing updates, using jump boxes to only access servers, and following Microsoft Defender for Cloud recommendations are great tools to keep your hosts secure.

## Scenario

A security engineer uses host security tools like privilege access workstation and virtual machine templates to keep application host machines secure; you will work on such tasks as:

 -  Deploy endpoint protection.
 -  Create and use a privileged access workstation.
 -  Set up protection tools like disk encryption and Windows Defender.
