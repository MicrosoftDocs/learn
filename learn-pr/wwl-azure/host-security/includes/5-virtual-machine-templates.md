Before diving into configuring VM policies and templates, you need to understand the features and functionality of Azure Resource Manager.

Resource Manager is the deployment and management service for your Azure subscription. It provides a consistent management layer that allows you to create, update, and delete resources in your Azure subscription. You can use its access control, auditing, and tagging features to help secure and organize your resources after deployment.

When you take actions through the Azure portal, Azure PowerShell, the Azure CLI, REST APIs, or client SDKs, the Resource Manager API handles your request. Because the same API handles all requests, you get consistent results and capabilities in all the different tools.

Here are some additional terms to know when using Resource Manager:

 -  **Resource provider**. A service that supplies Azure resources. For example, a common resource provider is Microsoft.Compute, which supplies the VM resource. Microsoft.Storage is another common resource provider.
 -  **Resource Manager template**. A JSON file that defines one or more resources to deploy to a resource group or subscription. You can use the template to consistently and repeatedly deploy the resources.
 -  **Declarative syntax**. Syntax that lets you state, "Hereâ€™s what I intend to create" without having to write the sequence of programming commands to create it. The Resource Manager template is an example of declarative syntax. In the file, you define the properties for the infrastructure to deploy to Azure.

You can use the Resource Manager template to define your VMs. After they are defined you can easily deploy and redeploy them. We recommend periodically redeploying your VMs to force the deployment of a freshly updated and security-enhanced VM OS.

### Template design

How you define templates and resource groups is entirely up to you and how you want to manage your solution. For example, you can deploy your three tier application through a single template to a single resource group.

But, you don't have to define your entire infrastructure in a single template. Often, it makes sense to divide your deployment requirements into a set of targeted, purpose-specific templates. You can easily reuse these templates for different solutions. To deploy a particular solution, you create a master template that links all the required templates. If you envision your tiers having separate lifecycles, you can deploy your three tiers to separate resource groups. Notice the resources can still be linked to resources in other resource groups.
