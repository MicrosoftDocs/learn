An interface is a blueprint that specifies a set of methods and properties that a class must implement. Interfaces define the behavior that implementing classes should adhere to, without providing any implementation details. An interface provides a way to define a common set of functionality that different classes can implement, promoting code reuse and maintainability.

But how do you know when to use an interface? And how do you decide between using a regular class, inheriting from an existing class, using an abstract class, or creating an interface? This is a common question in many technical interviews. Let's explore some scenarios where interfaces are useful, and some scenarios where they should be avoided.

## When to consider interfaces

Here are some common scenarios you may encounter where you should consider using an interface:

- <b>You're working on a project with other programmers</b><br/>
Do you need a reliable way for classes to perform similar actions? Interfaces can enforce code standards so that different programmers have a unified approach to working with objects.

- <b>You've identified the need for multiple classes</b><br/>
Do the classes share similar behaviors but require different implementations? Interfaces can be used to ensure that those classes share a common set of behaviors.

- <b>You've identified the need for a reusable behavior</b><br/>
Do you need a repeatable behavior with some variations? When designing a system that needs to support multiple implementations for a single behavior, interfaces can be used to define a contract that each implementation must follow.

- <b>You need to add functionality to existing code</b><br/>
Do you need to extend some classes to support a behavior? Interfaces help extend functionality without altering the existing structure of the class and without breaking existing code.

- <b>You need to unit test specific behaviors</b><br/>
When designing code that needs to be testable, interfaces can be used to define mock objects that can simulate the behavior of real objects during testing.

## When to avoid interfaces

While interfaces are useful, there are times when adding an interface can be unnecessary. Here are some scenarios where using an interface should be avoided:

- <b>You have rapidly changing requirements</b></br>
When requirements and project specifications are changing quickly, behaviors and their implementations are still being conceptualized. Using an interface early on could add limitations to classes and result in more complicated code.

- <b>A behavior is specific to one class</b></br>
When implementing a behavior that is specific to a single class, using an interface adds unnecessary abstraction and makes your code more complicated.

- <b>A behavior is unlikely to change</b></br>
When implementing a behavior that doesn't require much variation, or that isn't used by multiple classes, using an interface add unnecessary abstraction, making your code more difficult to understand.

- <b>You want a default behavior</b></br>
If you have a common behavior classes must implement, but prefer a default behavior that can be overridden, an interface isn't appropriate. Consider using an abstract class instead.

Overall, interfaces promote code reuse and maintainability. They're useful in scenarios where you need a common set of functionality across multiple classes. They're also useful when you need to extend functionality without altering the existing structure of a class. However, interfaces should be avoided in situations with rapidly changing requirements, behaviors specific to one class, or when default behaviors are needed.
