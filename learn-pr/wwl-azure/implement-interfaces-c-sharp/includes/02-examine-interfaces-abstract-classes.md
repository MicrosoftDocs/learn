A common interview question for programmers is: What's the difference between an interface and an abstract class? Let's take a deep dive and explore the two!

In object-oriented programming, polymorphism is a powerful concept. Both interfaces and abstract classes are a means to implement polymorphism. They both contain abstract methods that classes can implement, and they both provide loose coupling in code. But what makes them different?

Here are some key differences between interfaces and abstract classes:

- <b>Implementation</b><br/>
An abstract class can provide default implementation for some of its methods, whereas an interface can't provide any implementation details at all. This abstraction means that interfaces provide looser coupling between classes than abstract classes.

- <b>Inheritance</b><br/> 
A class can only inherit from one abstract class, but can implement multiple interfaces. Interfaces can also extend other interfaces. Classes can implement interfaces without being limited by inheritance.

- <b>Constructors</b><br/> 
An abstract class can have constructors, but an interface can't.

- <b>Fields</b><br/> 
An abstract class can have fields, but an interface can't. Interfaces must rely on properties instead.

- <b>Access Modifiers</b><br/> 
An abstract class can have public, protected, and internal access modifiers for its members, whereas interface members are always public.

Abstract classes are a good choice when you want to provide a base class with default implementation details while allowing for some variation in behavior. Interfaces are useful when you want to define a contract that classes must implement, but don't want to specify any implementation details. While abstract classes have important uses, interfaces are often preferred due to their looser coupling, multiple inheritance, and design implementation.
