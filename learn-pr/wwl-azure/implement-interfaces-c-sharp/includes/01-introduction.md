Interfaces allow you to assign a behavior to a class, and classes can use multiple interfaces. When different classes implement the same interface, they can be treated as the same type. Interfaces and polymorphism are powerful tools in object-oriented programming that allow for flexible and reusable code.

Suppose you're developing an inventory for a roleplaying game. There are different types of items the player can collect, but some of them share common behaviors. You'll use interfaces to implement the common behaviors, and use polymorphism to write simple code that efficiently handles different types of objects.

In this module, you'll learn to use multiple interfaces to grant classes more capabilities. You'll also learn to use interfaces as a type, and get a better understanding of the key features interfaces provide. By the end of this module, you'll be able to identify when to use interfaces to create well-designed code.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you will:

- Understand the difference between abstract classes and interfaces
- Learn how to combine multiple interfaces
- Understand how polymorphism applies to interfaces
- Use interfaces as a type

## Prerequisites

- Visual Studio Code installed
- A GitHub account to clone code repositories
- Basic knowledge of the Visual Studio Code IDE
- Basic understanding of the C# programming language
- Familiarity with classes, abstract classes, and inheritance
