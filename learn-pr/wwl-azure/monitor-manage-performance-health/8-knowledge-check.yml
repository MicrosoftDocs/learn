    choices:
    - content: "They should run the qwinsta command again."

      explanation: "Incorrect. Running the qwinsta command again will not help in collecting the RemoteFX Graphics performance counters."
    - content: "They should restart the remote session."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Restarting the remote session is not necessary for collecting the RemoteFX Graphics performance counters."
    - content: "They should select Start &gt; Administrative Tools &gt; Performance Monitor, expand Monitoring Tools, select Performance Monitor, and then select Add."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. This sequence of actions will lead them to the Add Counters dialog box where they can select and add the RemoteFX Graphics performance counters."
  - content: "A system administrator is tasked with setting up diagnostics for an Azure Virtual Desktop workspace. They notice that diagnostics are not enabled and an error message appears. What should the administrator do to enable the supported diagnostics tables?"
    choices:
    - content: "They should disable the Azure Virtual Desktop workspace and re-enable it"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Disabling and re-enabling the workspace will not enable the necessary diagnostics tables."
    - content: "They should ignore the error message and proceed with the setup"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Ignoring the error message will not enable the necessary diagnostics tables."
    - content: "They should enable the following supported diagnostics tables: Management Activities Feed, Errors, Checkpoints"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Enabling these specific diagnostics tables will allow the administrator to properly monitor the Azure Virtual Desktop workspace."
  - content: "A system administrator needs to monitor activities on Azure Virtual Desktop. They have set up diagnostics and named their settings configuration according to Azure naming conventions. What should they do next to access the Log Analytics workspace?"
    choices:
    - content: "They should search for 'Azure Monitor' in the Azure portal and select 'Logs' from the list."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While Azure Monitor can be used to access logs, the scenario specifically mentions accessing Log Analytics workspace."
    - content: "They should wait for a few hours for the data to be available and then directly access the data from the diagnostics setup."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Although it might take a few hours for the data to be available, they cannot access the data directly from the diagnostics setup."
    - content: "They should sign in to the Azure portal, search for 'Log Analytics workspace', select it under Services, and choose the workspace they configured for their Azure Virtual Desktop object."
