  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "A system administrator is tasked with diagnosing experience quality issues during Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) sessions. They have identified the remote session name and are now looking to collect the RemoteFX Graphics performance counters. What should they do next?"
    choices:
    - content: "They should run the qwinsta command again."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Running the qwinsta command again won't help in collecting the RemoteFX Graphics performance counters."
    - content: "They should restart the remote session."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Restarting the remote session isn't necessary for collecting the RemoteFX Graphics performance counters."
    - content: "They should select Start &gt; Administrative Tools &gt; Performance Monitor, expand Monitoring Tools, select Performance Monitor, and then select Add."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. This sequence of actions will lead them to the Add Counters dialog box where they can select and add the RemoteFX Graphics performance counters."
  - content: "A system administrator is tasked with setting up diagnostics for an Azure Virtual Desktop workspace. They notice that diagnostics aren't enabled and an error message appears. What should the administrator do to enable the supported diagnostics tables?"
    choices:
    - content: "They should disable the Azure Virtual Desktop workspace and re-enable it"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Disabling and re-enabling the workspace won't enable the necessary diagnostics tables."
    - content: "They should ignore the error message and proceed with the setup"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Ignoring the error message won't enable the necessary diagnostics tables."
    - content: "They should enable the following supported diagnostics tables: Management Activities Feed, Errors, Checkpoints"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Enabling these specific diagnostics tables will allow the administrator to properly monitor the Azure Virtual Desktop workspace."
  - content: "A system administrator needs to monitor activities on Azure Virtual Desktop. They have set up diagnostics and named their settings configuration according to Azure naming conventions. What should they do next to access the Log Analytics workspace?"
    choices:
    - content: "They should search for 'Azure Monitor' in the Azure portal and select 'Logs' from the list."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While Azure Monitor can be used to access logs, the scenario specifically mentions accessing Log Analytics workspace."
    - content: "They should wait for a few hours for the data to be available and then directly access the data from the diagnostics setup."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Although it might take a few hours for the data to be available, they can't access the data directly from the diagnostics setup."
    - content: "They should sign in to the Azure portal, search for 'Log Analytics workspace', select it under Services, and choose the workspace they configured for their Azure Virtual Desktop object."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. This is the procedure to access the Log Analytics workspace on the Azure portal."
  - content: "An IT professional is tasked with setting up Azure Virtual Desktop Insights to monitor their Azure Virtual Desktop environments. What are the minimum Azure role based access control (RBAC) roles they need to have assigned?"
    choices:
    - content: "Desktop Virtualization Writer and Log Analytics Writer"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While these roles exist, they aren't the minimum required for monitoring Azure Virtual Desktop Insights."
    - content: "Desktop Virtualization Reader and Log Analytics Writer"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The Log Analytics Writer role isn't necessary for monitoring Azure Virtual Desktop Insights."
    - content: "Desktop Virtualization Reader and Log Analytics Reader"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. These are the minimum RBAC roles required for monitoring Azure Virtual Desktop Insights."
