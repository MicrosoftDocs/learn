  questions:
  - content: "The company's VPN gateway must work with ExpressRoute. Which VPN type should be used?"
    choices:
    - content: "Policy-based"

    - content: "Route-based"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Typical route-based gateway scenarios include point-to-site, inter-virtual network, or multiple site-to-site connections. Route-based is also selected to coexist with an ExpressRoute gateway or when the IKEv2 protocol is used."
    - content: "Path-based"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Path-based is not a VPN type."

    choices:
