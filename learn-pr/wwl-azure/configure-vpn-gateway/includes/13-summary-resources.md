Azure VPN Gateway is a specific type of virtual network gateway that's used to send encrypted traffic between an Azure virtual network and an on-premises location over the public internet. You can also use an Azure VPN gateway to send encrypted traffic between Azure virtual networks over the Microsoft network.

In this module, you identified the features and usage cases for Azure VPN Gateway. You reviewed design implementation options, including site-to-site (S2S), point-to-site (P2S), and virtual network to virtual network (VNet-to-VNet). You explored the active-standby and active-active high availability scenarios and implementation considerations. You discovered how to configure S2S VPN connections by using a VPN gateway.
