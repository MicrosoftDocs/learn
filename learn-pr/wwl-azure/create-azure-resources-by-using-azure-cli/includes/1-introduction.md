This module teaches you how to use the **Azure Command-Line Interface (CLI)** to create and manage Azure resources efficiently. The Azure CLI is a cross-platform tool that enables you to execute administrative commands through terminal interfaces, making it ideal for both interactive resource management and automated deployments.

## Why Azure CLI matters

**Azure CLI** provides a consistent, scriptable way to manage Azure resources across Windows, Linux, and macOS platforms. Unlike the Azure portal's graphical interface, Azure CLI enables:

- **Automation at scale:** Manage hundreds of resources with scripts instead of manual clicks.
- **Version control:** Store infrastructure commands in Git alongside application code.
- **CI/CD integration:** Incorporate Azure resource management into DevOps pipelines.
- **Consistency:** Execute the same commands across development, staging, and production environments.
- **Flexibility:** Work from your local terminal, Azure Cloud Shell, or Docker containers.

## Learning objectives

After completing this module, you'll be able to:

- **Understand Azure CLI syntax:** Learn the command structure including reference groups, commands, parameters, and values.
- **Install and configure Azure CLI:** Set up Azure CLI on Linux, macOS, or Windows and authenticate to your Azure subscription.
- **Create Azure resources interactively:** Execute commands at the terminal to create resource groups and storage accounts.
- **Automate with Bash scripts:** Write and run scripts that use Azure CLI commands for repetitive tasks.
- **Troubleshoot effectively:** Use the `--debug` parameter and understand scripting language differences to resolve common issues.
- **Work efficiently:** Find help using `az find`, `--help`, and Azure CLI documentation indexes.

## Prerequisites

- **Command-line experience:** Familiarity with Bash, PowerShell, or similar terminal interfaces.
- **Azure fundamentals:** Basic understanding of Azure concepts including resource groups, storage accounts, and subscriptions.
- **Azure portal experience:** Practical experience managing Azure resources through the Azure portal interface.
- **DevOps awareness:** General knowledge of automation and infrastructure management practices.
