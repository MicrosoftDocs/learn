In this module, you learned how to:

- **Describe Azure CLI syntax components:** Understand the structure of **Azure CLI** commands, including command groups, subcommands, and parameters.
- **Use Azure CLI to automate the management of Azure resources:** Apply **Bash** scripting with loops, variables, and **Azure CLI** commands to create and manage resources at scale.
- **Run Azure CLI commands interactively and through a script:** Execute commands directly in the terminal for quick tasks, or save them in script files for repeatable automation.
- **Get help with Azure CLI commands:** Use `az find`, `--help`, documentation indexes, and **Copilot** to discover commands and troubleshoot issues.
- **Troubleshoot Azure CLI commands:** Use the `--debug` parameter to understand how commands are parsed, identify syntax errors, and see the underlying **API calls**.

## Key takeaways

**Azure CLI's** clean syntax and scripting capabilities make it a valuable tool, even for administrators new to **Bash**. By automating time-consuming and error-prone tasks, you can reduce administrative overhead and improve overall efficiency and quality.

### Why Azure CLI matters

- **Automation:** Script complex workflows that would be tedious in the **Azure portal**.
- **Version control:** Store scripts in **Git** for collaboration and change tracking.
- **CI/CD integration:** Incorporate **Azure CLI** into your **DevOps** pipelines for infrastructure as code.
- **Cross-platform:** Works on **Windows**, **Linux**, **macOS**, **Docker**, and **Azure Cloud Shell**.
