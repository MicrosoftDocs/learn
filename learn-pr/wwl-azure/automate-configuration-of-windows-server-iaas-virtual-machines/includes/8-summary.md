The Contoso IT Engineering team wanted you to consider using Azure Automation to automate the configuration of Windows Server IaaS VMs and detect configuration drift for those VMs. They also wanted you to research the steps you can take to remediate the configuration of those VMs.

In this module, you've discovered that *Azure Automation* is an Azure service that provides the ability to automate frequent, time-consuming, and error-prone administrative tasks. You've also discovered that an Automation runbook represents a collection of tasks that perform a custom process, and that Runbooks can execute scripts and workflows either on demand or according to an arbitrary schedule.

You've learned that Azure Automation includes a managed, Azure-resident DSC pull server that allows you to store DSC configurations, and to onboard managed computers to which these configurations should apply. With custom script extension, you can download and run scripts in Azure VMs. Further, you've learned how to deploy DSC extensions and implement those extensions into the correct configuration drift. You also learned to remediate noncompliant servers and use custom script extension.

You can now advise the Contoso IT team about using Azure Automation to automate the configuration of Windows Server IaaS VMs. You can also tell them how to use Azure to detect configuration drift for the VMs and the steps to remediate the configuration.
