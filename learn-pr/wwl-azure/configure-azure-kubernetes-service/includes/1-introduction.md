The standard container management runtime focuses on managing individual containers. If you want to scale a complex system with multiple containers working together, the task becomes challenging. To make the management process easier, it's common to use a container management platform, such as Kubernetes.

In this module, suppose you work at a fleet management company. Your company provides an asset tracking solution to customers worldwide. Your tracking solution is built and deployed as microservices. You're using containerized instances to quickly deploy into new customer regions and scale resources as needed to meet customer demands.

The company plans to use Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) to deploy and manage containerized applications. You're responsible for managing storage, scaling, network connections, and upgrades for the AKS solution.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you learn how to:

- Identify Azure Kubernetes Service components including pods, clusters, and nodes.
- Configure network connections for AKS.
- Configure storage options for AKS.
- Implement security options for AKS.
- Scale AKS including adding Azure Container Instances.
