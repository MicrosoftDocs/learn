  questions:
  - content: "Which Kubernetes component processes orchestration requests and schedules when to run requested containers?"
    choices:
    - content: "container"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A container is a lightweight and portable executable image that contains software and all its dependencies."
    - content: "kubelet"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The **kubelet** agent processes the orchestration requests from the Azure-managed node."
    - content: "node"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Nodes are individual virtual machines running containerized applications."
  - content: "How does Kubernetes enable internal-only applications to support other workloads within the cluster?"
    choices:
    - content: "The LoadBalancer service"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The LoadBalancer service creates an Azure Load Balancer resource, configures an external IP address, and connects the requested pods to the Load Balancer back-end pool. To allow customer traffic to reach an application, load-balancing rules are created on the desired ports."
    - content: "The NodePort service"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The NodePort service creates a port mapping on the underlying node that allows the application to be accessed directly with the node IP address and port."
    - content: "The ClusterIP service"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The ClusterIP service creates an internal IP address for use within the Azure Kubernetes Service cluster."
