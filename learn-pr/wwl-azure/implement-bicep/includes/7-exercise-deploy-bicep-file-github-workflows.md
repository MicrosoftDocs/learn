[GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/actions) are similar to Azure Pipelines in nature. They provide a way to automate software development and deployments. In this exercise, you'll learn how to deploy a Bicep file using a *GitHub Action*.

## Prerequisites

 -  You'll need a GitHub account that you can [create for free here](https://github.com/join).
 -  A GitHub repository is also required to store your Bicep file and workflows created earlier in the [Exercise - Create Bicep templates](/training/modules/implement-bicep/4-exercise-create-bicep-templates). Once you've created your GitHub repository, push the Bicep file into it.
 -  For deployment to Azure, access to an Azure subscription is needed, which can be [created for free here](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).

## Creating a service principal in Azure

To deploy your resources to Azure, you'll need to create a service principal which GitHub can use. So open a terminal or use Cloud Shell in the Azure portal and type the following commands:

```Cloud Shell
az login
az ad sp create-for-rbac --name myApp --role contributor --scopes /subscriptions/{subscription-id}/resourceGroups/Bicep --sdk-auth
```

> [!NOTE]
> Don't forget to replace the Subscription ID with yours.

When the operation succeeds, it should output a JSON object that contains your `tenantId`, `subscriptionId`, `clientId`, `clientSecret`, and a few more properties, such as the following.

```JSON
{
    "clientId": "<GUID>",
    "clientSecret": "<GUID>",
    "subscriptionId": "<GUID>",
    "tenantId": "<GUID>",
    (...)
}
```

Note this object since you'll need to add it to your GitHub secrets.

## Creating a GitHub secret

In your GitHub repository, navigate to **Settings** &gt; **Secrets** &gt; **Actions**. Create a new secret called `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` and paste the entire JSON object you got from the previous step.

Create another secret for the name of the resource group with a name such as `AZURE_RG` and one for the subscription.

## Creating a GitHub action

1.  First, navigate to your repository and select the Actions menu. Then, set up a workflow to create an empty workflow in your repository. You can rename the file to a different name if you prefer.

2.  Replace the content of the file with the following snippet:
    
    ```YAML
    on: [push]
    name: Azure ARM
    jobs:
        build-and-deploy:
            runs-on: ubuntu-latest
            steps:
                # Checkout code
                - uses: actions/checkout@main
    
                  # Log into Azure
                - uses: azure/login@v1
                  with:
                      creds: ${{ secrets.AZURE_CREDENTIALS }}
    
                  # Deploy Bicep file
                - name: deploy
                  uses: azure/arm-deploy@v1
                  with:
                      subscriptionId: ${{ secrets.AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION }}
                      resourceGroupName: ${{ secrets.AZURE_RG }}
                      template: ./main.bicep
                      parameters: storagePrefix=stg
                      failOnStdErr: false
    ```
    
    Feel free to replace the storage account prefix with your own.
    
    > [!NOTE]
    > The first part of the workflow defines the trigger and its name. The rest defines a job and uses a few tasks to check out the code, sign in to Azure, and deploy the Bicep file.
3.  Select **Start commit**, and enter a title and a description in the pop-up dialog. Then select **Commit directly to the main branch**, followed by **Commit a new file**.

4.  Navigate to the Actions tab and select the newly created action that should be running.

5.  Monitor the status and when the job is finished, check the Azure portal to see if the storage account is being created.
