It's time to create your first Bicep template. After following this unit, you'll learn how the Bicep extension in VS Code simplifies development by providing type safety, syntax validation, and autocompletion.

## Prerequisites

To follow along, you'll need to have access to an Azure subscription. You also need to have:

 -  VS Code.
 -  Azure CLI.
 -  Bicep extension for VS Code.

## Create your first template

Open your VS Code and create a new file called `main.bicep`. When it's done, open the file and start typing storage. You should see a menu appears from which select the first option `res-storage` by pressing **Enter** or **Tab**. You should end up with a snippet that looks like:

```Bicep
resource storageaccount 'Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts@2021-02-01' = {
    name: 'name'
    location: location
    kind: 'StorageV2'
    sku: {
        name: 'Premium_LRS'
    }
}
```

This file will deploy an *Azure Storage Account*, however, we need to modify the file to make it ready for deployment. First let's add two parameters, one for the name since it should be unique, and one for the location.

```Bicep
param storageName string = 'stg${uniqueString(resourceGroup().id)}'
param location string = resourceGroup().location
```

The value you assign to the parameters is the default value that makes the parameters optional. Replace the name property with `storageName` and since the location is already used you're good to go ahead with the deployment.

## Visualize resources

You can use VS Code to visualize the resources defined in your Bicep file. Click on the visualizer button at the top right-hand corner:

## Compile the file

You don't need to compile the file to be able to deploy it, but it's good to know how you can do it.

Open the integrated terminal in VS Code by right-clicking on your Bicep file and selecting the **Open in Integrated Terminal** menu.

Use the build command as follows:

```Bash
az bicep build -f ./main.bicep
```

Feel free to take a look at the resulting ARM template and compare the two.

## Deploying the Bicep file

Now is the time to deploy the Bicep file you've created. In the same terminal run the following commands:

```azurecli
az group create --name Bicep --location eastus
az deployment group create --resource-group Bicep --template-file main.bicep --parameters storageName=uniqueName
```

> [!NOTE]
> Replace the `uniqueName` with a unique name, but you can also ignore providing the parameter since it has a default value.

When the deployment finishes, you'll be getting a message indicating the deployment succeeded.

## Next steps

Now that you've learned how to create a basic template and deploy it, head over to the next unit to learn more about the constructs in a Bicep file.
