**Estimated Time**: 20 minutes

## Scenario

In a platform engineering environment, developers need a way to provision infrastructure consistently and efficiently. This lab will guide you through using Bicep, an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool, to deploy and manage Azure resources in a self-service manner. You'll create a Bicep template to provision a resource group, an Azure App Service, an Azure SQL Database, and a Storage Account while enforcing governance with tagging and policies.

## Objectives

After completing this lab, you can:

- Set up Bicep in your environment.
- Create a Bicep template to define Azure resources.
- Deploy an Azure App Service with a SQL Database backend.
- Enforce governance using tags and policies.
- Implement automated scaling with Bicep.

## Requirements

- Azure subscription - If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
- Basic knowledge of Azure services and Azure CLI.
- Visual Studio Code installed with the Bicep extension.
- Azure CLI installed and configured on your local machine.
- Familiarity with Infrastructure as Code (IaC) concepts.

## Exercises

During this lab, you complete the following exercises:

- Exercise 1: Create a Bicep template to deploy Azure resources.
- Exercise 2: Enforce governance with tags and policies.
- Exercise 3: Implement automated scaling with Bicep.
