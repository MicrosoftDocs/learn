You should now be familiar with Azure Cosmos DB API for MongoDB modeling, sharding and indexing. Additionally, you should now also be familiar with using aggregation pipelines in Azure Cosmos DB API for MongoDB. These topics will allow you to design collections with better performance and lower the Request Unit costs of your queries. 

Now that you've completed this module, you can:

- Understand how modeling and sharding affect the performance of your Azure Cosmos DB database.
- Learn about different index types we can use in an Azure Cosmos DB API for MongoDB collection.
- Learn about the support for MongoDB aggregation pipelines in Azure Cosmos DB API for MongoDB.
