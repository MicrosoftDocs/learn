IT departments must be able to meet user requirements. The technologies must be flexible and able to support an environment where work styles change rapidly across different devices and locations. Additionally, companies often expect IT departments to do more to improve business efficiency with fewer resources. An established device life cycle ensures organizations have the right technologies in place for users to remain productive. The life-cycle also ensures that when devices have reached end-of-life, they don't become a liability. In today's environment, where users frequently use personal devices, they also become part of that life cycle.

Organizations constantly manage the different phases of the enterprise desktop life cycle. These phases include:

- **Planning:** Preparing defining a strategy for system management.
- **Purchasing:** Processing requisitions, and then obtaining approval of invoices for payment.
- **Deployment:** Installing an operating system, enrolling devices, and deploying applications to the device.
- **Operations:** Ensuring that systems are functioning properly and are protected.
- **Support:** Ensuring that the end users learn how to use their systems and applications, and receive the support they need.
- **Upgrade and Retire:** This phase includes replacing devices, retiring obsolete hardware, or unenrolling a device from the organization.
