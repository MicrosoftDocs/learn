The enterprise desktop has evolved. IT Management and Support can be a challenging task, given the dynamic nature of the IT world today. IT professionals once considered the enterprise desktop an organization-owned computer or laptop that was shared or assigned to a specific employee. Today, the enterprise desktop could be a computer, laptop, phone, or tablet. Either the company or the employee who works in an office, from home, a hotel room, or a customer site may own these devices.

Traditional management methods need help with accommodating these new scenarios. Modern endpoint management introduces new techniques and concepts for deploying and maintaining the infrastructure in such a dynamic landscape.

The enterprise deployment lifecycle is a framework for identifying the processes and tasks required to deploy and manage an organization’s desktops. This process includes the initial planning of the entire deployment lifecycle, desktop acquisition, the deployment process itself, and post-deployment management. The lifecycle also includes how you'll support the deployment process, including upgrades, and how it will eventually be retired.
