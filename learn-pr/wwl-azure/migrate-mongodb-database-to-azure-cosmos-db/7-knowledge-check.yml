  questions:
  - content: "The marketing team needs to do an online migration of a 900-GB MongoDB database to Azure Cosmos DB. However, during a previous similar migration, some rate limiting errors were discovered. To reduce the possibility of this type of errors, the migration will need to control the rate of writes it does. Which tool should be used for this migration?"
    choices:
    - content: "**Azure Data Factory (ADF)**"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. ADF should only be used for Offline migrations."
    - content: "**Azure Databricks and Spark**"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. This method allows the **maxBatchSize** value to be set, which controls the rate at which data is saved to the target Azure Cosmos DB collection, giving the migration control of preventing rate limiting errors."
    - content: "**Azure Data Migration Service (DMS)**"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While DMS is recommended for online migrations < 1 TB, DMS doesn't provide the migration with an option to control data rate, so rate limiting errors could occur."
  - content: "The accounting team is about to start the pre-migration planning phase and heard that the Data Migration Assistant (DMA) is a great tool to collect information for a couple of the planning stages. During which planning stages will the DMA collect data?"
    choices:
    - content: "***Pre-migration logistic planning***"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The DMA does not collect any information during the logistic planning stage."
    - content: "***Pre-migration mapping***"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The DMA does not collect any information during the mapping stage."
    - content: "***Pre-migration discovery***"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The DMA collects data for the *Pre-migration assessment* and *Pre-migration discovery* stages."
  - content: "During the pre-migration planning, the IT team was informed that some of the planning decisions will be immutable so they have to be careful to get it right the first time. Out of the following decisions to make, which one is considered the most crucial because it can't be changed after the migration?"
    choices:
    - content: "Choosing the MongoDB server version."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The MongoDB server version can be changed at any time. Azure Cosmos DB only enables or disables features when a different version is chosen, so it isn't an immutable decision."
    - content: "When setting the collection throughput, choose Autoscale or Manual Throughput."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. If the throughput is set at the collection level, the throughput can change between Autoscale and Manual at any moment, so it isn't an immutable decision."
    - content: "Choosing the Shard Key of the collection."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. One of the most important decisions to do on the collection level, is choosing the best possible shard key.  Not only because it will define the performance of the collection, but also because once the shard key is set, it can't be changed.  This choice is immutable."
