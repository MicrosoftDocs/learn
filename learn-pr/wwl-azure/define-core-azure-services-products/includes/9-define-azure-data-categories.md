## Data categories in Azure

You can generally think of data as **structured**, **semi-structured**, and **unstructured**. 

## Structured data

+ Structured data is data that adheres to a schema, so all the data has the same fields or properties. 
+ Structured data can be stored in a database table with rows and columns. 
+ Structured data relies on keys to indicate how one row in a table relates to data in another row of another table. 
+ Structured data is also known as *relational data*. The data's schema defines the table of data, the fields in the table, and the clear relationship between the two. 
+ Structured data is easy to enter, query, and analyze because all the data follows the same format. 
+ Examples of structured data include sensor data or financial data.

## Semi-structured data

+ Semi-structured data is less organized than structured data.
+ Semi-structured data is not stored in a relational format, meaning the fields do not neatly fit into tables, rows, and columns. 
+ Semi-structured data contains tags that make the organization and hierarchy of the data apparent. 
+ Semi-structured data is also known as *non-relational* or *NoSQL* data.
+ Examples of semi-structured data include books, blogs, and HTML documents.

## Unstructured data

+ Unstructured data has no designated structure.
+ Unstructured data can hold any kind of data.
+ Unstructured data is becoming more prominent as businesses try to tap into new data sources.
+ Examples of unstructured data include a PDF document, a JPG image, a JSON file, and video content.
