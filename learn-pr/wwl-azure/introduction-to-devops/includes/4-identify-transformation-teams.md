Unless you're building an entirely new organization, one of the significant challenges of any DevOps transformation project is dealing with competing priorities that conflict with ongoing business operations.

## The transformation team challenge

**Availability Challenge**: If the staff members leading the transformation are also involved in existing day-to-day work, it will be challenging for them to focus on the transformation when their current role directly impacts customer outcomes. Desperate customer situations will always take priority over long-term transformation projects.

**Organizational Inertia**: Implementing existing processes and procedures to support current business outcomes can make it difficult to disrupt the status quo required for true DevOps transformation.

## Building your DevOps transformation team

Research by Dr. Vijay Govindarajan and Dr. Chris Trimble in "Beyond the Idea: How to Execute Innovation" shows that successful innovation often occurs despite existing organizational processes. They concluded that it only works by creating a separate team to pursue the transformation.
