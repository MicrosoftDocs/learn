**"DevOps is the union of people, process, and products to enable continuous delivery of value to our end users."** \- According to Donovan Brown in [What is DevOps?](https://www.donovanbrown.com/post/what-is-devops)

The DevOps learning paths will help you prepare for a DevOps journey. You will learn the main characteristics of the DevOps process, tools, and people involved during the lifecycle. Also, it prepares you for the Microsoft DevOps Solution certification exam. You will see other content to ensure you have a complete picture of DevOps. The module's content consists of graphics, reference links, module review questions, and optional hands-on labs.

You will learn:

 -  How to plan for DevOps.
 -  Use source control.
 -  Scale Git for an enterprise.
 -  Combine artifacts.
 -  Design a dependency management strategy.
 -  Manage secrets.
 -  Implement continuous integration.
 -  Implement a container build strategy.
 -  Design a release strategy.
 -  Set up a release management workflow.
 -  Implement a deployment pattern.
 -  Optimize feedback mechanisms.

Plan before your act. This module will help you understand what DevOps is and how to plan for a DevOps transformation journey.

## What is the DevOps transformation journey?

The DevOps transformation journey is a series of 10 learning paths. It familiarizes you with Azure DevOps, GitHub. Also, learn its many services, features, and integration with tools to support your DevOps process.

### Why should I take Azure DevOps learning paths?

People in these modules are interested in designing and implementing DevOps processes. Also, they are preparing for the [AZ-400 - Designing and Implementing Microsoft DevOps Solutions](/learn/certifications/exams/az-400) certification exam.

The certification exam is for DevOps professionals. Combine people, processes, and technologies to continuously deliver valuable products and services that meet end-user needs and business goals. DevOps professionals streamline delivery by optimizing practices, improving communications and collaboration, and creating automation.

They design and implement application code and infrastructure strategies that allow for continuous integration, testing, delivery, and continuous monitoring and feedback.

Exam candidates must be proficient with Agile practices. They must be familiar with Azure administration, Azure development, and experts in at least one of these areas.

DevOps professionals must design and implement DevOps practices for version control, compliance, infrastructure as code, configuration management, build, release, and testing-using Azure technologies.

There are seven domain areas.
