Azure is a continually expanding set of cloud services that help you meet current and future business challenges. Azure gives you the freedom to build, manage, and deploy applications on a massive global network using your favorite tools and frameworks. 

## What does Azure offer?

With help from Azure, you have everything you need to build your next great solution. The following lists several of the benefits that Azure provides, so you can easily invent with purpose:

 -  **Be ready for the future**: Continuous innovation from Microsoft supports your development today and your product visions for tomorrow.
 -  **Build on your terms**: You have choices. With a commitment to open source, and support for all languages and frameworks, you can build how you want and deploy where you want.
 -  **Operate hybrid seamlessly**: On-premises, in the cloud, and at the edge, we'll meet you where you are. Integrate and manage your environments with tools and services designed for a hybrid cloud solution.
 -  **Trust your cloud**: Get security from the ground up, backed by a team of experts, and proactive compliance trusted by enterprises, governments, and startups.

## What can I do with Azure?

Azure provides more than 100 services that enable you to do everything from running your existing applications on virtual machines to exploring new software paradigms, such as intelligent bots and mixed reality.

Many teams start exploring the cloud by moving their existing applications to virtual machines (VMs) that run in Azure. Migrating your existing apps to VMs is a good start, but the cloud is much more than a different place to run your VMs.

For example, Azure provides artificial intelligence (AI) and machine-learning (ML) services that can naturally communicate with your users through vision, hearing, and speech. It also provides storage solutions that dynamically grow to accommodate massive amounts of data. Azure services enable solutions that aren't feasible without the power of the cloud.
