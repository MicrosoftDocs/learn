Databases are the most common places to store and process data. Security for your database and the data within it is required to keep your Azure solutions safe. Using data encryption, data masking, firewalls, and auditing you can protect your database from almost any attacks.

## Scenario

A security engineer uses Azure features like Microsoft Defender for Cloud for SQL to protect valuable data, you will work on such tasks as:

 -  Architect a secure SQL database implementation including authentication, firewalls, and auditing.
 -  Encrypt the data in your database and while it is in transit.
 -  Use Microsoft Defender for Cloud for SQL to keep your data safe.
