Ensuring your data is safe when it is stored in Azure SQL databases is a must for every Azure Security Engineer. Azure provides several features to help lock down your databases and monitor their security.

You should be able to:

 -  Configure which users and applications have access to your SQL databases
 -  Block access to your servers using firewalls
 -  Discover, classify, and audit the use of your data
 -  Encrypt and protect your data while is it stored in the database.
