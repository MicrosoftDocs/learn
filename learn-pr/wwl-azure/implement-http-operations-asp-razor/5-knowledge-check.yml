  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "What is the recommended approach for implementing `HttpClient` in an app with long-lived clients?"
    choices:
    - content: "Create a new instance of `HttpClient` for each request."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This approach is not recommended for long-lived clients."
    - content: "Use clients created by `IHttpClientFactory`."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This approach is recommended for short-lived clients."
    - content: "Create a `static` or singleton instance using the `HttpClient` class and set `PooledConnectionLifetime`."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. For long-lived clients, create a `static` or singleton instance using the `HttpClient` class and set `PooledConnectionLifetime`."
  - content: "What is the purpose of `IHttpClientFactory` in an ASP.NET Core app?"
    choices:
    - content: "To handle the creation and disposal of REST operations"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. `IHttpClientFactory` handles the creation and disposal of HTTP clients, not REST operations."
    - content: "To handle the creation and disposal of HTTP requests"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. `IHttpClientFactory` handles the creation and disposal of HTTP clients, not requests."
    - content: "To handle the creation and disposal of HTTP clients"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. `IHttpClientFactory` handles the creation and disposal of HTTP clients, which can be used to perform REST operations."
  - content: "What is the purpose of the `PooledConnectionLifetime` property in the `HttpClient` class in .NET Core?"
    choices:
    - content: "To limit the lifetime of the connection, forcing a DNS lookup when the connection is replaced."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The `PooledConnectionLifetime` property is used to limit the lifetime of the connection, forcing a DNS lookup when the connection is replaced."
    - content: "To allow the HttpClient to track time to live (TTL) durations specified by the DNS server."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The HttpClient does not track TTL durations. Instead, it only resolves DNS entries when a connection is created."
    - content: "To provide a central location for naming and configuring logical HttpClient instances."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The `PooledConnectionLifetime` property doesn't provide a central location for naming and configuring HttpClient instances that is a feature of the `IHttpClientFactory`."
