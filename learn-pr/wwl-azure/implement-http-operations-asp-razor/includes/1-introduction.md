Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) requests are a way of asking a web server to provide or update a resource. HTTP defines a set of methods for sending requests to a web server. The server responds to the request by sending back the requested resource, or an error message if the resource isn't available or the request is invalid.

After completing this module, you'll be able to:

* Implement HTTP clients in .NET Core.
* Use HTTP clients to perform safe and unsafe operations.
* Add code to support HTTP operations in an ASP.NET Core Razor Pages app.
