Log Analytics provides a query syntax to quickly retrieve and consolidate data in the repository. You can create and save Log Searches to directly analyze data in the portal or have log searches run automatically to create an alert if the results of the query indicate an important condition.

To give a quick graphical view of the health of your overall environment, you can add visualizations for saved log searches to your dashboard. To analyze data outside of Log Analytics, you can export the data from the repository into tools such as Power BI or Excel. You can also use the Log Search API to build custom solutions.
