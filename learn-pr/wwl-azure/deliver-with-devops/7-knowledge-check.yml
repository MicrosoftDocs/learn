  questions:
    - content: "What is the primary distinction between continuous delivery and continuous deployment?"
      choices:
        - content: "Continuous deployment focuses on minimizing time to deploy and time to mitigate, while continuous delivery strives to implement full automation."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. This answer describes the characteristics of continuous delivery and continuous deployment, but doesn't provide the primary distinction between them."
        - content: "Continuous delivery automates the entire software delivery process, while continuous deployment requires manual approval for the final delivery."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. This answer describes the primary distinction between continuous delivery and continuous deployment incorrectly."
        - content: "Continuous deployment implements full automation, including the production environment, while continuous delivery requires a manual approval for the final delivery."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct. Continuous deployment and continuous delivery are closely related DevOps concepts with similar names and the same acronym. The primary distinction between them is that continuous deployment implements full automation, including the production environment, while continuous delivery requires a manual approval for the final delivery."
    - content: "What is the purpose of progressive exposure techniques in CD practices?"
      choices:
        - content: "To minimize potential damage caused by programming errors that weren't detected by CI-based code analysis, reviews, and automated testing."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct. Progressive exposure techniques aim to control the blast radius of programming errors that weren't detected by CI-based code analysis, reviews, and automated testing."
        - content: "To increase the number of users who can access the application at once."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. This answer doesn't align with the purpose of progressive exposure techniques."
        - content: "To eliminate all potential programming errors."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. This answer is too extreme and doesn't align with the purpose of progressive exposure techniques."
    - content: "What is the main principle of IaC that ensures consistency of the target environment and precludes the possibility of unintended side effects of intermediary changes?"
      choices:
        - content: "Automation"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. Automation enhances efficiency, consistency, and scalability, but doesn't ensure consistency of the target environment."
        - content: "Version control"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. Version control facilitates tracking changes to infrastructure in the same manner as tracking software versions."
        - content: "Idempotence"
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct. Idempotence designates the characteristic of an action where the outcome is always the same, regardless of the number of times the action is performed. This ensures the consistency of the target environment and precludes the possibility of unintended side effects of intermediary changes."
    - content: "What is the purpose of a GitHub Actions workflow?"
      choices:
        - content: "To create a new repository in GitHub."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. This isn't the purpose of a GitHub Actions workflow."
        - content: "To implement software delivery workflows by using the capabilities of the GitHub platform."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct. A GitHub Actions workflow provides the mechanism for implementing software delivery workflows by using the capabilities of the GitHub platform."
        - content: "To store and reuse data across steps in a workflow."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. This is the purpose of a variable in a GitHub Actions workflow."
