  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "Which data format is accepted by Azure AI Search when you're pushing data to the index?"
    choices:
    - content: "CSV."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. If source data is a CSV file, you'll have to convert it to JSON before you can push it to an index. You can also use an indexer to parse CSV files stored in Azure Storage."
    - content: "SQL."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. SQL data isn't supported natively. You can either convert it to JSON or use an indexer that serializes the content for you."
    - content: "JSON."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Azure AI Search can index JSON documents. JSON is also used to define index schemas, indexers, and data source objects."
  - content: "Which explanation best describes an indexer and an index?"
    choices:
    - content: "An indexer converts documents into JSON and forwards them to a search engine for indexing."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. An indexer serializes a source document into JSON before passing it to a search engine for indexing. An indexer automates several steps of data ingestion, reducing the amount of code you need to write."
    - content: "An indexer can be used instead of an index if the files are already in the proper format."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. An indexer is used to populate an index, but isn't a replacement for an index."
    - content: "An indexer is only used for AI enrichment and skillset execution."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A skillset requires an indexer, but an indexer doesn't require a skillset. You can use indexers to create a search index from textual content in any supported data source."
  - content: "If you set up a search index without including a skillset, which would you still be able to query?"
    choices:
    - content: "Sentiment."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Detecting the sentiment in content requires a skillset that includes the Sentiment Analysis skill."
    - content: "Text content."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Azure AI Search is used for full text search over indexes containing alphanumeric content."
    - content: "Image captions."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Creating captions for images requires a skillset that includes the Image Analysis skill."
