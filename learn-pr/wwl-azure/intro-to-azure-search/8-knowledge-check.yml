  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: 'Which one of the following statements about query requests is true?'
    choices:
    - content: All query composition is based on the full Lucene syntax 
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Azure Cognitive Search provides a simple syntax as the default. The optional full Lucene syntax is used for more advanced queries such as fuzzy search, proximity search, and regular expressions.
    - content: Query requests include search criteria, but nothing for shaping search results
      isCorrect: false
      explanation:  A query request is a comprehensive instruction to the search engine. A single call can combine a search expression, a $filter expression, pagination, which fields to search, and which fields to return.
    - content: Search explorer returns results in JSON only
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Search explorer returns results in JSON only. 
    - content: searchMode must be set to ON in order for queries to work
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Valid values are "any" or "all". The searchMode specifies whether a positive match can be made using any of the criteria, or whether all of the criteria must be satisfied.

  - content: 'Which of the following data sources can be used as an input data source?'
    choices:
    - content: Azure Data Lake 
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Azure Data Lake is not a supported external data source. It is, however, entirely possible to write code to use the REST API, and push data from Azure Data Lake to Azure Cognitive Search.
    - content: Azure Virtual Machines
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Azure Virtual Machines are not a supported data source. SQL Server installed on a virtual machine is a supported source however.
    - content: Azure SQL Database
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Azure SQL Database is one of the supported external data sources in Azure Cognitive Search. Azure SQL Database has a built-in indexer ready made for Azure Cognitive Search.
    - content: Azure Queue Storage
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Azure Queue Storage is not supported. Only Blob and Table Storage are supported external sources within Azure Storage.

  - content: 'Which data format is accepted by Azure Cognitive Search when you are pushing data to the service?'
    choices:
    - content: CSV
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: CSV isn't supported.
    - content: SQL
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: SQL isn't supported.
    - content: XML
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: XML isn't supported.
    - content: JSON
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Documents are stored in the search index as JSON documents. JSON is also used to define index schemas, indexers, and data source objects.
