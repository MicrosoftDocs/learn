  - content: "Which data format is accepted by Azure Cognitive Search when you are pushing data to the index?"
    choices:
    - content: "CSV."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Your Azure Storage blob can contain all types of files, but CSV isn't supported for the Search index."
    - content: "SQL."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. SQL isn't supported."
    - content: "JSON."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Documents are stored in the search index as JSON documents. JSON is also used to define index schemas, indexers, and data source objects."
  - content: "What is a correct explanation of an indexer and an index?"
    choices:
    - content: "Azure's indexer exports incoming documents into JSON and pushes the JSON to an index for storage."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Documents in Azure blob storage are exported to JSON before getting stored in the search index. Azure's indexer is a tool that automates the document export process."
    - content: "Azure's indexer can be used instead of an index if the files are already in the proper format."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Azure's indexer is not a replacement for an index."
    - content: "Azure's indexer is only used to implement a knowledge store which is stored in the index."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Azure's indexer is not only used with AI skillsets to create knowledge stores."
  - content: "If you set up a search index without including any AI skillsets, which would you still be able to query?"
    choices:
    - content: "Sentiment."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Detecting the sentiment in content requires an AI skillset."
    - content: "Text content."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Text from content can be directly saved as a field in an index."
    - content: "Image captions."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Creating captions for images requires an AI skillset."
