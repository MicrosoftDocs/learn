Instead of using out-of-the-box tasks, a command line, or a shell script, you can also use your custom build and release task.

By creating your tasks, the tasks are available publicly or privately to everyone you share them with.

Creating your task has significant advantages.

 -  You get access to variables that are otherwise not accessible.
 -  You can use and reuse a secure endpoint to a target server.
 -  You can safely and efficiently distribute across your whole organization.
 -  Users don't see implementation details.
