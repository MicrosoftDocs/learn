A build and release platform requires executing any number of repeatable actions during the build process. Tasks are units of executable code used to do selected actions in a specified order.<br>‎:::image type="content" source="../media/tasks-9fde6c3b.png" alt-text="Build tasks.":::


Add steps to specify what you want to build. The tests you want to run and all the other steps needed to complete the build process.

There are steps for building, testing, running utilities, packaging, and deploying.

If a task isn't available, you can find numerous community tasks in the marketplace.

Jenkins, Azure DevOps, and Atlassian have an extensive marketplace where other tasks can be found.
