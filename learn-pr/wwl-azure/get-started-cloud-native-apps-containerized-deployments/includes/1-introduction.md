Cloud-native applications are built from the ground up and optimized for cloud scale and performance. Theyâ€™re based on microservices architectures, use managed services, and take advantage of continuous delivery to achieve reliability and faster time to market.

## Scenario

Suppose you work on a team that wants to deploy cloud-native apps using Azure services. The team doesn't have a lot of experience using Azure for app deployments so they've asked you to investigate. You begin by exploring the benefits of running containerized apps and the container service options in Azure. To better understand the solution architecture, you'll examine a reference solution that includes many of the tools the team expects to use in their solution.

## Table of contents

- Examine cloud-native apps.
- Examine deployment options for cloud-native apps.
- Review an Azure Container Apps solution architecture and resources.

## Goal

The goal of this module is to provide an overview of the tools and resources used to deploy containerized apps to Azure Container Apps. This includes accounts and subscriptions, Azure resources, host environment resources, and continuous deployment resources.
