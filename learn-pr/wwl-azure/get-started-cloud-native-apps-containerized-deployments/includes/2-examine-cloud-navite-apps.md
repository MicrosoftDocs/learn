The speed and agility of cloud-native derives from many factors. Foremost is cloud infrastructure. But there are five other foundational pillars that help provide the bedrock for cloud-native systems.

## Cloud infrastructure and the pillars of cloud-native

Cloud-native systems take full advantage of the cloud service model.

Designed to thrive in a dynamic, virtualized cloud environment, these systems make extensive use of Platform as a Service (PaaS) compute infrastructure and managed services. They treat the underlying infrastructure as disposable - provisioned in minutes and resized, scaled, or destroyed on demand – via automation.

Consider the difference between how we treat pets and commodities. In a traditional data center, servers are treated as pets: a physical machine, given a meaningful name, and cared for. You scale by adding more resources to the same machine (scaling up). If the server becomes sick, you nurse it back to health. Should the server become unavailable, everyone notices.

The commodities service model is different. You provision each instance as a virtual machine or container. They're identical and assigned a system identifier such as Service-01, Service-02, and so on. You scale by creating more instances (scaling out). Nobody notices when an instance becomes unavailable.

The commodities model embraces immutable infrastructure. Servers aren't repaired or modified. If one fails or requires updating, it's destroyed and a new one is provisioned – all done via automation.

Cloud-native systems embrace the commodities service model. They continue to run as the infrastructure scales in or out with no regard to the machines upon which they're running.

The Azure cloud platform supports this type of highly elastic infrastructure with automatic scaling, self-healing, and monitoring capabilities.

## Benefits of cloud-native apps

Cloud-native applications are built to take advantage of cloud computing models to increase speed, flexibility, and quality, while reducing deployment risks. Cloud-native applications offer the following advantages:

- **Resilient**. Cloud-native applications are resilient to failure and can scale to meet demand. They're designed to be loosely coupled and distributed, so if one component fails, the application can continue to function.
- **Elastic**. Cloud-native applications can scale out to meet demand and scale in to reduce costs. They can also scale to zero when not in use.
- **Observable**. Cloud-native applications are observable, so you can monitor their health and performance.
- **Automated**. Cloud-native applications are automated, so you can build, test, and deploy them quickly and reliably.
- **Portable**. Cloud-native applications are portable, so you can run them in the cloud, on-premises, or in a hybrid environment.
- **Secure**. Cloud-native applications are secure, so you can protect your data and your customers.
- **Composable**. Cloud-native applications are composable, so you can build them from modular components that can be reused across applications.
- **Modern**. Cloud-native applications are modern, so you can use the latest technologies and practices to build them.
- **Open**. Cloud-native applications are open, so you can use open-source software and avoid vendor lock-in.
- **Managed**. Cloud-native applications are managed, so you can focus on building your application instead of managing infrastructure.
- **Cost-effective**. Cloud-native applications are cost-effective, so you can reduce costs by paying only for what you use.
- **Sustainable**. Cloud-native applications are sustainable, so you can reduce your environmental impact.
- **Inclusive**. Cloud-native applications are inclusive, so you can build applications that are accessible to everyone.
- **Collaborative**. Cloud-native applications are collaborative, so you can build applications with your team.
- **Data-driven**. Cloud-native applications are data-driven, so you can use data to make decisions and improve your application.
- **Agile**. Cloud-native applications are agile, so you can respond quickly to changes in your business and your customers' needs.
- **Innovative**. Cloud-native applications are innovative, so you can use the latest technologies and practices to build them.
