The top-level resource in Azure Container Instances is the **container group**. A [container group](/azure/container-instances/container-instances-container-groups) is a collection of containers that get scheduled on the same host machine. The containers share a lifecycle, resources, local network, and storage volumes.

### Things to know about container groups

Let's review some of details about container groups for Azure Container Instances.

- A container group is similar to a pod in Kubernetes. A pod typically has a 1:1 mapping with a container, but a pod can contain multiple containers. The containers in a multi-container pod can share related resources.

- Azure Container Instances allocates resources to a multi-container group by adding together the resource requests of all containers in the group. Resources can include items such as CPUs, memory, and GPUs.

- There are two common ways to deploy a multi-container group: Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates and YAML files.
  
  - **ARM template**. An ARM template is recommended for deploying other Azure service resources when you deploy your container instances, such as an Azure Files file share.
  
  - **YAML file**. Due to the concise nature of the YAML format, a YAML file is recommended when your deployment includes only container instances.

- Container groups can share an external-facing IP address, one or more ports on the IP address, and a DNS label with an FQDN.
   
   - **External client access**. You must expose the port on the IP address and from the container to enable external clients to reach a container in your group.
   
   - **Port mapping**. Port mapping isn't supported because containers in a group share a port namespace.
   
   - **Deleted groups**. When a container group is deleted, its IP address and FQDN are released.

#### Configuration example

Consider the following example of a multi-container group with two containers.

The multi-container group has the following characteristics and configuration:

- The container group is scheduled on a single host machine, and is assigned a DNS name label.
- The container group exposes a single public IP address with one exposed port.
- One container in the group listens on port 80. The other container listens on port 1433.
- The group includes two Azure Files file shares as volume mounts. Each container in the group mounts one of the file shares locally.

### Things to consider when using container groups

Multi-container groups are useful when you want to divide a single functional task into a few container images. Different teams can deliver the images, and the images can have separate resource requirements.

Consider the following scenarios for working with multi-container groups. Think about what options can support your internal apps for the online retailer.

- **Consider web app updates**. Support updates to your web apps by implementing a multi-container group. One container in the group serves the web app and another container pulls the latest content from source control.

- **Consider log data collection**. Use a multi-container group to capture logging and metrics data about your app. Your application container outputs logs and metrics. A logging container collects the output data and writes the data to long-term storage.

- **Consider app monitoring**. Enable monitoring for your app with a multi-container group. A monitoring container periodically makes a request to your application container to ensure your app is running and responding correctly. The monitoring container raises an alert if it identifies possible issues with your app.

- **Consider front-end and back-end support**. Create a multi-container group to hold your front-end container and back-end container. The front-end container can serve a web app. The back-end container can run a service to retrieve data.
