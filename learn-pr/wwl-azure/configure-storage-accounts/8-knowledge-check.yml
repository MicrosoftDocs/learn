  title: ""
  questions:
  - content: "Which storage solution replicates data to a secondary region, and maintains six copies of the data?"
    choices:
    - content: "Locally redundant storage"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Locally redundant storage replicates data three times within a single data center in the primary region."
    - content: "Read-access geo-redundant storage"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Read-access geo-redundant storage is the default replication option. Geo-redundant storage (GRS) copies the data synchronously three times within a single physical location in the primary region by using LRS. The data is then copied asynchronously to a single physical location in the secondary region."
    - content: "Zone-redundant storage"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Zone-redundant storage replicates Azure Storage data synchronously across three Azure availability zones in the primary region."
  - content: "The admin team needs to know the requirements for storage account names. To what extent does a storage account name need to be unique?"
    choices:
    - content: "The name must be unique within the containing resource group."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A storage account name doesn't have to be unique in a resource group."
    - content: "The name must be unique within the organization's subscription."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A storage account name doesn't have to be unique in an Azure subscription."
    - content: "The name must be globally unique."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The storage account name is used as part of the URI for API access, so it must be globally unique."
  - content: "What's the best storage account solution to support the requirements of the manufacturing division?"
    choices:
    - content: "Locally redundant storage"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Locally redundant storage is the best choice. It's the lowest cost solution, the data is being continuously created, and data loss isn't an issue."
    - content: "Geo-redundant storage"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Is there a lower-cost solution for temporary data?"
    - content: "Zone-redundant storage"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Is there a lower-cost solution for temporary data?"
