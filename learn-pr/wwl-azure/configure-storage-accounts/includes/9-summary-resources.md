An Azure storage account contains all of your Azure Storage data objects. These data objects can be blobs, files, queues, tables, and disks. The storage account provides a unique namespace for your Azure Storage data. The data is accessible from anywhere in the world over HTTP or HTTPS. Data in your Azure storage account is durable and highly available, secure, and massively scalable.

You should now be able to:

 -  Create and configure storage accounts.
 -  Configure network access to storage accounts.
