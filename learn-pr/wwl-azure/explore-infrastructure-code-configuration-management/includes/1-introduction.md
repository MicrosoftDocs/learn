**Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** represents a foundational DevOps methodology that enables teams to manage infrastructure through code rather than manual processes. This approach has become essential for modern software delivery—many experts consider IaC a prerequisite for successful DevOps implementation.

Instead of manually configuring servers or using one-off scripts, **IaC treats infrastructure the same way developers treat application code.** This means your networks, servers, and other resources are defined in version-controlled files that can be reviewed, tested, and deployed consistently.

**Key IaC principles include:**

- **Version control:** Infrastructure definitions stored in Git or other version control systems
- **Automated testing:** Infrastructure changes validated before deployment
- **Continuous monitoring:** Infrastructure state tracked and managed
- **Reproducibility:** Same configuration produces identical results every time

Modern cloud platforms like Azure, AWS, and Google Cloud provide elastic, on-demand resources. To fully leverage this flexibility, organizations must adopt IaC practices across their entire infrastructure portfolio. Tools like **Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates, Terraform, Bicep, and Ansible** enable teams to provision and configure infrastructure programmatically.

This module explores IaC foundational concepts, environment deployment strategies, and configuration management approaches. You'll learn about **imperative versus declarative** configuration styles and **idempotent** operations that ensure consistent outcomes.

## Learning objectives

After completing this module, you'll be able to:

- Implement environment deployment automation using Infrastructure as Code
- Design configuration management strategies with version control
- Choose between imperative and declarative configuration approaches
- Apply idempotent configuration principles for consistent infrastructure

## Prerequisites

- Understanding of DevOps principles and practices
- Familiarity with version control systems (helpful but not required)
- Basic knowledge of cloud computing concepts
