quiz:
  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
    - content: "Which of the following choices is defines the ability to apply one or more operations against a resource, resulting in the same outcome every time?"
      choices:
        - content: "Increment."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. Idempotence is a mathematical term that can be used in Infrastructure as Code and Configuration as Code. It's the ability to apply one or more operations against a resource, resulting in the same outcome."
        - content: "Idempotence."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct. Idempotence is a mathematical term that can be used in Infrastructure as Code and Configuration as Code. It's the ability to apply one or more operations against a resource, resulting in the same outcome."
        - content: "Configuration Drift."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. Idempotence is a mathematical term that can be used in Infrastructure as Code and Configuration as Code. It's the ability to apply one or more operations against a resource, resulting in the same outcome."
    - content: "Which of the following choices is a benefit of infrastructure as code?"
      choices:
        - content: "Treats infrastructure as a flexible resource that can be provisioned, de-provisioned, and reprovisioned as and when needed."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct. Treats infrastructure as a flexible resource that can be provisioned, de-provisioned, and reprovisioned as and when required."
        - content: "Uses mutable service processes."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. Treats infrastructure as a flexible resource that can be provisioned, de-provisioned, and reprovisioned as and when needed."
        - content: "Manual scale-up and scale-out."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. Treats infrastructure as a flexible resource that can be provisioned, de-provisioned, and reprovisioned as and when needed."
    - content: What is the significance of idempotency in Infrastructure as Code and Configuration as Code?
      choices:
        - content: It ensures that scripts and templates are executed only once.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. Idempotency allows for scripts and templates to be executed multiple times with the same outcome.
        - content: It prevents the scaling in and out of resources and applications.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. Idempotency does not prevent scaling, but rather ensures consistent results despite scaling.
        - content: It allows for operations to be applied against a resource multiple times, resulting in the same outcome.
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: Correct. Idempotency ensures that regardless of how many times an operation is applied, the outcome remains the same.
