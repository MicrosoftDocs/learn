Vibe coding is an innovative approach to software development that leverages AI tools to generate applications. Instead of manually writing code, the developer uses natural language prompts to describe the desired functionality and the AI agent generates the corresponding code. This shifts the programmer's role from traditional coding to guiding, testing, and refining the AI-generated output.

Imagine you're a business professional who needs to create a prototype e-commerce app but lacks extensive programming knowledge. With vibe coding, you can describe the app's features in natural language, and the AI generates the necessary code, allowing you to focus on the product experience rather than the technical implementation.

The topics covered in this module include:

- Understanding the vibe coding process and its phases.
- Exploring the benefits and challenges of vibe coding.
- Learning how to create effective prompts for GitHub Copilot.
- Using GitHub Copilot to generate product requirements and wireframe diagrams.
- Configuring the GitHub Copilot environment for customized responses.

After completing this module, youâ€™ll be able to:

- Explain vibe coding and the vibe coding approach to software development.
- Create effective prompts for GitHub Copilot in a vibe coding process.
- Generate product requirements and wireframe diagrams using GitHub Copilot.
- Configure the GitHub Copilot environment for customized responses.
- Create a prototype app using vibe coding and GitHub Copilot Agent.

> To complete this GitHub Copilot training, you must have an active subscription for GitHub Copilot in your personal GitHub account (includes the GitHub Copilot Free plan), or you must be assigned to a subscription managed by an organization or enterprise. Module activities may include GitHub Copilot suggestions that match public code. If you're a member of an organization on GitHub Enterprise Cloud who has been assigned a GitHub Copilot subscription through your organization, the setting for suggestions matching public code may be inherited from your organization or enterprise. If your account blocks suggestions that match public code, module activities may not work as expected.
