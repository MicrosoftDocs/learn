Adopting a vibe coding approach doesn't eliminate the need for product planning or design, but it can affect how you define product and user interface (UI) requirements.

In a vibe coding approach, you describe your requirements using natural language, which the AI transforms into formal requirements and wireframe diagrams. You can also use AI to generate coding guidelines that help to ensure your AI-generated code meets your expectations.

> [!NOTE]
> The time invested in thorough planning pays dividends throughout the development process. Well-defined requirements and wireframe diagrams lead to more accurate AI suggestions and fewer iterations needed to achieve your desired outcome.

## Envision your product

Effective vibe coding begins with structured planning that transforms abstract ideas into actionable development guidance. This systematic approach ensures your AI collaboration is focused and productive. The first step is to define the "vision" for your product.

> [!NOTE]
> The scope and depth of vision documents depend on many factors, including the size, complexity, value, and projected duration of your project. However, for a vibe coding approach that's focused on a prototype app and rapid iteration, you can often create a concise vision that captures the essence of your product.

For a vibe coding approach, you can construct a simple product vision by working through a series of targeted questions to define your application's purpose and boundaries.

**Goal**: Define a simple product vision through AI collaboration.

Start by articulating the high-level vision for your product. This vision should describe the problem you're solving, your target users, and the core value your product delivers.

Use GitHub Copilot to brainstorm your product vision. Begin the conversation by describing your idea and asking clarifying questions. For example:

- **Problem identification**: What value does your product provide to users? Describe the problem that your application solves.
- **Target audience**: What are the needs, preferences, and technical capabilities of your customer? Describe the people who will use your application.
- **Platform strategy**: Will your application run on web browsers, mobile devices, desktop computers, or multiple platforms?
- **Feature scope**: What core features are essential for your minimum viable product (MVP)? What features can be added later?
- **Technology stack**: What programming languages, frameworks, and tools align with your project goals and constraints?
- **Data requirements**: What information will your application need to store, process, or display?
- **Security considerations**: Are there privacy concerns, sensitive data, or compliance requirements to address?

GitHub Copilot can help you refine your answers and summarize them into a concise product vision.

For example, a simple vision for an e-commerce prototype might look like the following:

- **Problem**: Customers need a simple way to browse and purchase products online.
- **Target audience**: Local users comfortable with basic web interactions.
- **Value proposition**: Streamlined shopping experience with intuitive product discovery.
- **Scope**: A prototype with core e-commerce functionality, excluding user accounts and payment processing.
- **Technology stack**: Web application using React and Node.js.
- **Data requirements**: Product information, such as name, price, description, and image.
- **Security considerations**: Prototype doesn't handle sensitive data, so basic security measures are sufficient.

## Create a product requirements document

A product requirements document (PRD) serves as your project's blueprint, providing clear guidance for both human developers and AI assistants. This document is often shared with stakeholders to ensure alignment and gather feedback.

> [!NOTE]
> The sections and level of detail included in your PRD generally depend on the size and scope of your project. Businesses often adopt a standardized PRD template to ensure consistency across projects, but you can also create a custom document that suits your needs.

**Goal**: Translate your product vision into a structured Product Requirements Document (PRD) that guides development and AI collaboration.

A PRD outlines what your application will do, how it will behave, and what constraints it must meet. It serves as a blueprint for both human developers and AI tools.

Use GitHub Copilot to generate your PRD. Start by sharing your product vision and asking Copilot to create a PRD with specific sections, such as:

- **Product summary**: What the app does and its main goal.
- **Target audience**: Who will use the app.
- **Core features**: Key functionality and their purpose.
- **UI descriptions**: Layout and design elements for each screen.
- **Navigation**: How users move between screens.
- **Sample data**: Example content to demonstrate functionality.
- **Technical requirements**: Tools, languages, and frameworks.
- **Styling**: Desired look and feel (e.g., minimal, responsive).
- **Use cases**: Main user flows and interactions.
- **Out-of-scope**: Features intentionally excluded.

### Prioritize features for your MVP

Organize features into three categories to maintain focus:

- **Must-have**: Essential for the app to function.
- **Should-have**: Enhances usability but not critical.
- **Could-have**: Nice-to-have features for future iterations.

> [!TIP]
> Ask GitHub Copilot to help categorize features and suggest additional ones based on your product vision.

## Establish user interface and user experience requirements

Product planning should include a description of the user interface and user experience. Visual elements are often the best way to communicate these requirements.

**Goal**: Define the layout, navigation, and user flow of your application using wireframe diagrams and other visual aids.

Wireframe diagrams provide a visual representation your application's structure and functionality. They help bridge the gap between written requirements and implementation.

You can use GitHub Copilot Agent or other AI tools to generate wireframe diagrams based on your PRD. You can describe your layout in natural language, and the AI can produce:

- **Low-fidelity wireframes**: Simple layouts showing content placement and navigation.
- **User flow diagrams**: Visual paths users take through your app.
- **Interface specifications**: Key interactions, data displays, and input methods.

> [!TIP]
> You can use tools like Microsoft 365 Copilot, GitHub Copilot Agent, Figma, or draw.io to create wireframe diagrams.

### Example user flow

```text
Entry Point → Product Listing → Product Details → Add to Cart → Cart Review → Checkout → Confirmation
```

### Wireframe fidelity levels

- **Low-fidelity**: Sketches or simple layouts for early feedback.
- **Medium-fidelity**: More detail, including component types and spacing.
- **High-fidelity**: Pixel-perfect designs with final content and interactions.

> [!TIP]
> Describe your layout and user flow in natural language. GitHub Copilot Agent can generate low-fidelity wireframe diagrams or structured layout descriptions to guide development.

## Identify coding standards and guidelines for the project

Coding standards and guidelines are used to define code quality expectations, ensuring it meets project or business requirements and adheres to established best practices. These standards help maintain consistency, readability, and maintainability across your codebase.

Selecting an appropriate list of coding standards and guidelines helps ensure your AI-generated code meets your expectations.

**Goal**: Define coding standards that ensure quality, consistency, and security in AI-generated code.

Use GitHub Copilot to generate coding guidelines tailored to your project. Start by describing your goals (e.g., clean code, accessibility, security), and ask Copilot to suggest standards in the following areas:

- **Code style**: Naming conventions, formatting, and documentation.
- **Security**: Input validation, authentication, and data protection.
- **Testing**: Unit tests, integration tests, and test coverage.
- **Performance**: Load handling, response times, and optimization.
- **Accessibility**: Compliance with WCAG and inclusive design.

### Example prompt

```plaintext
Suggest coding standards for a secure, accessible web app built with React. Include formatting, testing, and performance guidelines.
```

> [!TIP]
> Even if you don’t have specific standards in mind, GitHub Copilot can help you establish a baseline that you can refine over time.

## Summary

By defining your product vision, creating a structured PRD, establishing user interface requirements, and identifying coding standards, you set a solid foundation for your vibe coding project. This structured approach ensures that both human developers and AI tools have clear guidance, leading to more effective collaboration and higher-quality outcomes.
