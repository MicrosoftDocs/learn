Windows user profiles are assigned to each user signed onto a PC and each user profile has its own state, set of files, and folders. There are four types of user profiles that can be configured, local user profiles, roaming user profiles, mandatory user profiles, and temporary user profiles. Because user profiles contain specific user data, the users profile size can increase rapidly. Administrators can help reduce overall user profile size by making use of quotas, folder redirects, and group policy. Cloud based services like Enterprise State Roaming and Microsoft OneDrive enable users to move to different Windows devices or change between device platforms and maintain access to their data.
