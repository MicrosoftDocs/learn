You can integrate your cloud-enabled software as service (SaaS) applications with Microsoft Entra ID. Refer to the Microsoft Entra ID Marketplace for a list of all SaaS apps that have been pre-integrated into Microsoft Entra ID. Use the application network portal to request a System for Cross-Domain Identity Management (SCIM) enabled application to be added to the gallery for automatic provisioning or n SAML / OpenID Connect (OIDC) enabled application to be added to the gallery for SSO. Once you add the application from the gallery, configure and test Microsoft Entra ID SSO for the application.

## Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO for Slack

Configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Slack using a test user called B.Simon. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between a Microsoft Entra user and the related user in Slack.

To configure and test Microsoft Entra SSO with Slack, perform the following steps:<br>

1. Configure Microsoft Entra SSO - to enable your users to use this feature.<br>

 -  Create a Microsoft Entra test user - to test Microsoft Entra single sign-on with B.Simon.
 -  Assign the Microsoft Entra test user - to enable B.Simon to use Microsoft Entra single sign-on.

2. Configure Slack SSO - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.

 -  Create Slack test user - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Slack that is linked to the Microsoft Entra representation of user.

3. Test SSO - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Microsoft Entra SSO

Follow these steps to enable Microsoft Entra SSO.

1. Sign in to the Microsoft Entra admin center as at least a Cloud Application Administrator.<br>

2. Browse to **Identity**, **Applications**, **Enterprise applications**, **Slack**, **Single sign-on**.<br>

3. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.<br>

4. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, click the edit/pen icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.<br>

:::image type="content" source="../media/set-up-single-sign-on-with-saml-fc9f46b4.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing an example of the setup single sign-on with saml page.":::


5. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, enter the values for the following fields:

 -  In the **Identifier (Entity ID)** text box, type the URL: `https://slack.com`<br>
 -  In the **Reply URL** text box, type a URL using one of the following patterns:

**Reply URL**

`https://<DOMAIN NAME>.slack.com/sso/saml`

`https://<DOMAIN NAME>.enterprise.slack.com/sso/saml`

 -  In the Sign-on URL text box, type a URL using one of the following patterns:

**Sign on URL**

`https://<DOMAIN>.slack.com`

`https://<DOMAIN>.enterprise.slack.com`

> [!NOTE]
> The value for Identifier (Entity ID) can be a variable if you have more than one Slack instance that you need to integrate with the tenant. Use the pattern `https://<DOMAIN NAME>.slack.com`. In this scenario, you also must pair with another setting in Slack by using the same value.

6. Slack application expects the SAML assertions in a specific format, which requires you to add custom attribute mappings to your SAML token attributes configuration. The following screenshot shows the list of default attributes.
