title: Automatically tune SQL Server on Linux
summary: |
  Database administrators often spend much time optimizing performance for their database queries. 
  In SQL Server 2016 and later, you can use the Query Store feature to collect query performance 
  information and view recommendations that may help accelerate responses. In SQL Server 2017, 
  you can also use automatic tuning to configure the server to apply these recommendations. This 
  module shows you how to collect performance data when using SQL Server 2017 on Linux servers by 
  using Azure Data Studio and how to use Query Store and automatic tuning.
abstract: |
 In this module, you will:
 - Decide whether to enable Query Store.
 - Use Azure Data Studio to monitor performance in SQL Server on a Linux server.
