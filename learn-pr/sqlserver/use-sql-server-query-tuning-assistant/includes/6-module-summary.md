In this module, you learned about the Query Store feature, introduced in SQL Server 2016. You saw how it offers data collection that helps you monitor query performance continually. You can enable the Query Store on any database on an instance of SQL Server 2016 or higher, whatever the database compatibility level. It's also ideal for A/B testing, where you monitor the effect of making one change, like adding or altering an index.

You also learned about the cardinality estimator algorithm, and how it was rewritten in SQL Server 2014. As a result, when the compatibility level of a migrated database is moved, the new cardinality estimator is then used. This change in estimator might cause performance issues that the Query Store, along with the Query Tuning Assistant (QTA), can help you resolve. The QTA identifies regressing queries and experiments to find the best performance fix. You then use the fixes to create plan guides.

The combination of the Query Store and QTA is ideal for monitoring database performance after an upgrade. You learned that you should migrate a database to SQL Server 2019 and leave the compatibility level in place, then enable the Query Store to collect baseline data.

When enough statistics have been gathered, you can change the database compatibility. The Query Store then continues to gather data on the upgraded database. The QTA compares the before and after to find and fix regressing queries.
