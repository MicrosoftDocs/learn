  questions:
  - content: "Which versions of SQL Server support the Query Store?"
    choices:
    - content: "Any version after SQL Server 2005."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The Query Store wasn't introduced until SQL Server 2016, so it isn't available in earlier server versions."
    - content: "SQL Server 2016 and later."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Any database running on SQL Server 2016 or later can use the Query Store, regardless of the database compatibility level."
    - content: "Only SQL Server 2022."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The Query Store was introduced in SQL Server 2016, so any SQL Server 2016 or later instance can use the Query Store."
  - content: "Which feature predicts how many rows a query is likely to return?"
    choices:
    - content: "The cardinality estimator."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "The cardinality estimator predicts how many rows a query is likely to return, so a cost-based query optimizer can select the best query plan."
    - content: "The Query Tuning Assistant (QTA)."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The QTA experiments with different query plans, but doesn't predict how many rows a query is likely to return."
    - content: "The Query Store."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The Query Store collects query statistics, but doesn't predict how many rows a query is likely to return."
  - content: "Which of the following statements about automatic plan correction is true?"
    choices:
    - content: "It's set at the server level."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Automatic plan correction is set at the database level."
    - content: "It can change the execution plan of an individual query to use an earlier cardinality estimator."
      isCorrect: true 
      explanation: "Automatic plan correction instructs SQL Server to use the last good plan if regression is found, and can mean rolling back to an earlier cardinality estimator."
    - content: "It always uses the cardinality estimator that's mapped to the target compatibility level."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Unlike the QTA, automatic plan correction can mean rolling back to an earlier cardinality estimator."
  - content: "What does the Query Tuning Assistant (QTA) do?"
    choices:
    - content: "Collects data to monitor queries or measure the effects of a single change."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The Query Store collects data, which the QTA can then use to identify and help fix regressing queries."
    - content: "Predicts how many rows a query is likely to return."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The cardinality estimator, not the QTA, predicts how many rows a query is likely to return based on compatibility level."
    - content: "Finds queries that are beginning to regress and experiments to find solutions."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "The QTA uses Query Store data to find underperforming queries and automatically seek solutions to speed them up."
  - content: "How long should the Query Store run to gather sufficient workload information on a database?"
    choices:
    - content: "Long enough for the Query Store to capture a typical cycle of business activity."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Let the Query Store capture a typical cycle of business activity, including business hours, nightly processing, maintenance windows, and other activities. You should seek to understand the user usage patterns and capture an entire cycle of activity."
    - content: "One week."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The Query Store should capture a typical business cycle of actual user activity before making significant changes. A typical business cycle of reporting, user interaction, and bulk operations may be daily, biweekly, monthly, or even quarterly."
    - content: "It depends on the Query Store version."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The Query Store should capture a typical business cycle of actual user activity before making significant changes. A typical business cycle of reporting, user interaction, and bulk operations may be daily, biweekly, monthly, or even quarterly."
  - content: "What's the correct order of steps for using the QTA to evaluate query regressions caused by upgrading a database from SQL Server 2012 to SQL Server 2022?"
    choices:
    - content: "Migrate the database to SQL Server 2022 and upgrade the compatibility level. Enable the Query Store and collect statistics on the database after the upgrade, and use the QTA to investigate regressing queries."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "For the QTA to function correctly, you must collect baseline Query Store statistics before you upgrade the compatibility level, and compare them to results after the upgrade."
    - content: "Enable the Query Store and collect baseline query statistics. Migrate the database to SQL Server 2022 and upgrade the compatibility level. Collect Query Store statistics after the upgrade, and use the QTA to investigate regressing queries."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The Query Store wasn't introduced until SQL Server 2016, so you must migrate the database to at least a SQL Server 2016 instance before you can enable the Query Store and collect baseline statistics."
    - content: "Migrate the database to SQL Server 2022. Enable the Query Store on the database and collect baseline statistics. Upgrade the compatibility level, continue to collect Query Store statistics, and use the QTA to investigate regressing queries."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "For the QTA to function correctly, you should collect Query Store statistics both before and after upgrading the compatibility level. Then use the QTA to compare the two sets of statistics and investigate regressing queries."
  - content: "Which of the following choices isn't a valid setting for Query Store in SQL Server 2022?"
    choices:
    - content: "Off"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Off, Read only, and Read write are valid settings for Query Store in SQL Server 2022."
    - content: "Active"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Off, Read only, and Read write are the only valid settings for Query Store in SQL Server 2022."
    - content: "Read only"
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: "Off, Read only, and Read write are valid settings for Query Store in SQL Server 2022."
    - content: "Read write"
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: "Off, Read only, and Read write are valid settings for Query Store in SQL Server 2022."
