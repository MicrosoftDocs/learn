SQL Server 2022 provides a rich set of features to help you secure your data, scale your workloads, and ensure your data is available when you need it.

We saw in this module how SQL Server 2022 enhances security through ledger, and improvements in Always Encrypted with secure enclaves, server roles, and dynamic data masking.

We also saw how SQL Server 2022 continues to provide scalability without requiring application changes by adding features like buffer pool parallel scan and concurrent global allocation maps (GAM) and shared global allocation maps (SGAM) updates.

Finally, we saw how SQL Server 2022 provides new capabilities for availability through contained availability groups, snapshot backups without relying on VDI, and backup compression using Intel&reg; QuickAssist Technology (QAT).

In this module, you've learned how about:

- What ledger for SQL Server is, and how to use ledger tables to enhance your auditing capabilities.
- Security feature enhancements, like the added granular fixed server roles, Always Encrypted enhancements, strict connection encryption, and granular UNMASK permissions for dynamic data masking.
- The enhancements to memory management, `tempdb`, and how SQL Server 2022 can help you scale large-memory environments with no code or application changes.
- New capabilities around SQL Server 2022 availability, including contained availability groups, cross-platform snapshot backups, and Intel&reg; QuickAssist Technology backup compression.
