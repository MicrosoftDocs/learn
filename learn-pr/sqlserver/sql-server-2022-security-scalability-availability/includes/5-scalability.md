Now let's look at scalability, and how new features in SQL Server 2022 can help significantly improve the performance of your workloads. By upgrading to SQL Server 2022, you can see significant improvements just by using the default configurations and features that were added to help scalability. 

In this unit, we'll go over:

- Buffer pool parallel scan
- System page latch concurrency enhancements

## Buffer pool parallel scan

Introduced in SQL Server 2022, buffer pool parallel scan is a feature that improves the performance of buffer pool scan operations that help customers as they scale their SQL Server environments. Common operations such as database startup or shutdown, creating a new database, file drop operations, backup and restore operations, Always On failover events, DBCC CHECKDB and DBCC Check Table, log restore operations, and other internal operations will all benefit from buffer pool parallel scan.

### What is a buffer pool and why does it affect performance?

A buffer is an 8-KB page in memory and the buffer pool (also known as the buffer cache) is divided into 8-KB pages. The buffer pool is the area in memory where SQL Server stores data pages that are read from disk, and all pages must be copied into the buffer pool before they can be used in a query. Imagine that you have a 1-TB buffer space. With 1 TB, the buffer pool scan needs to iterate over 130 million buffers.

In SQL Server 2019 and earlier, scanning the buffer pool was always a serial operation. Meaning that the larger your environment or memory on your machine, the bigger performance effect you would see to scanning the buffer pool, as the scan would need to iterate over all the buffers serially. There was no way to eliminate this problem, and the issue wasn't necessarily correlated to how large of an operation you were doing. You would see a difference in performance versus a smaller system even when creating a new database, or shutting down SQL Server, as the bigger system would take longer to scan the buffer pool.

### Solving scaling with buffer pool parallel scan

With buffer pool parallel scan, the buffer pool scan can be parallelized, and the scan can complete faster. This is an important improvement for large-memory machines, as you can see the effect to performance when scaling your environment. Customers are seeing 10 to 30 times the improvement in operations that scan the buffer pool, just by using SQL Server 2022 as buffer pool parallel scan is enabled by default.

## System page latch concurrency enhancements

As in prior versions of SQL Server, SQL Server 2022 has introduced further improvements to `tempdb` performance, and this time to address:

- Concurrent global allocation maps (GAM) updates
- Concurrent shared global allocation maps (SGAM) updates

### The performance problem with tempdb

One of the biggest performance issues we see with scaling a SQL Server environment is with `tempdb`. `tempdb` is a system database that is used to store temporary objects such as global or local temporary tables, temporary stored procedures, table variables, table-valued functions, and cursors. `tempdb` is also used for row versioning, online index operations, snapshots, and triggers. `tempdb` is a shared resource, used for nearly every SQL Server workload, and all sessions in the SQL Server instance uses the one `tempdb` database.

Another `tempdb` use is to internally spill to disk when there isn't enough memory available for a process or there's an inaccurate estimate that causes SQL Server to spill to `tempdb`. As we have started pushing towards bigger machines with larger workloads, we have started seeing concurrency issues emerge in the `tempdb` space in three key areas:

- [Object allocation contention](/troubleshoot/sql/database-engine/performance/recommendations-reduce-allocation-contention)
- [Metadata contention](/sql/relational-databases/databases/tempdb-database#memory-optimized-tempdb-metadata)
- [Temporary table cache contention](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/sql-server-blog/tempdb-files-and-trace-flags-and-updates-oh-my/ba-p/385937)

### Solving scaling issues with concurrent GAM and SGAM updates

If you've been managing a large SQL Server environment, you've likely ran into issues with higher concurrent workloads, and one of the likely causes was with `tempdb` contentions. For a couple decades, we have recommended a best practice of having multiple data files for `tempdb` to relieve contentions, including contentions to GAM and SGAM. You may have discovered SQL Server performance issues with high workloads but underutilized CPUs on your machine, and read about [PAGELATCH waits](/sql/relational-databases/diagnose-resolve-latch-contention), and followed guides troubleshooting `tempdb`.

Continuing the scaling enhancements with SQL Server 2022, we've introduced concurrent GAM and SGAM updates to help address the performance bottleneck with `tempdb` with no application changes or configuration required. This improvement erases nearly all `tempdb` contention, allowing parallel threads to be able to modify the GAM and SGAM pages. With all of these enhancements, users should be able to use the defaults from SQL Server 2022 setup to configure `tempdb` files and no longer have to perform any other tuning for `tempdb` system page latch contention. This potentially enables you to have a *hands-free* approach to managing the `tempdb`.
