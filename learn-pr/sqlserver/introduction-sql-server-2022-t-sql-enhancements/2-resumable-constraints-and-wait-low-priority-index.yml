  questions:
  - content: "Which of the following SQL Server 2022 commands allows you to pause and resume an ALTER TABLE ADD CONSTRAINT operation?"
    choices: 
    - content: "ALTER INDEX"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "ALTER INDEX is used to pause and resume constraint operations, like adding PRIMARY KEY and UNIQUE constraints, in SQL Server 2022."
    - content: "ALTER TABLE"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "ALTER TABLE is used to add, modify, or drop constraints, but it doesn't pause and resume constraint operations."
    - content: "ALTER CONSTRAINT"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "ALTER CONSTRAINT isn't a valid command in SQL Server."
  - content: "In SQL Server 2022, to which command was the WAIT_AT_LOW_PRIORITY clause extended?"
    choices:
    - content: "ALTER TABLE ADD CONSTRAINT"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The WAIT_AT_LOW_PRIORITY clause was extended to the CREATE INDEX command, not the ALTER TABLE ADD CONSTRAINT command."
    - content: "CREATE INDEX"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "In SQL Server 2022, the WAIT_AT_LOW_PRIORITY clause was extended to the CREATE INDEX command, allowing better management of lock contention during index creation."
    - content: "ALTER INDEX"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The WAIT_AT_LOW_PRIORITY clause was added to the ALTER INDEX command in SQL Server 2014 not in SQL Server 2022."
