# Summary

In this module, you explored the language features introduced in SQL Server 2025 and how they improve day‑to‑day development and analytics.

In this module, you learned about the following areas:

- **Vector and AI integration**: You saw how to register external models, generate embeddings, store vectors, index them, and search by similarity.  
- **Pattern matching and text extraction**: You worked with the REGEXP family of functions and the enhanced `SUBSTRING` function to locate, extract, count, and split text.  
- **JSON and string aggregation**: You created JSON arrays and objects and produced delimited strings directly from queries, with support for the `||` concatenation operator and `UNISTR`.  
- **Encoding and similarity functions**: You encoded and decoded strings in Base64 and compared text with multiple similarity and distance measures.  
- **Date and numeric enhancements**: You used `CURRENT_DATE`, extended `DATEADD`, and the `PRODUCT()` aggregate to simplify calculations and forecasting.
