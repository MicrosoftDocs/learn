In SQL Server 2022, we've added new features to several of our string-manipulation functions, enhancing them for greater flexibility. Previously, SQL Server provided `LTRIM`, `RTRIM`, and `TRIM` functions to remove leading and trailing spaces. In SQL Server 2022, we've enhanced these functions to allow specifying a set of characters to remove. Additionally, the `STRING_SPLIT` function now offers an optional parameter for returning an index value of each substring's position in the input string.

## LTRIM, RTRIM, and TRIM

In SQL Server 2022, we've enhanced the `LTRIM` and `RTRIM` functions with an optional *characters* parameter that allows you to specify a set of characters to be removed from the beginning or end of the string. We've also enhanced the `TRIM` function to remove specified characters from the start, end or both of a string using the `LEADING`, `TRAILING`, or `BOTH` keywords.

## STRING_SPLIT

SQL Server 2022 adds a third optional *ordinal* parameter to the end of the `STRING_SPLIT` function, enabling the option to create a 1-based index array of values for each substring's position in the input string. By default, the function has the value of zero or *disabled*. To enable it, set it to the value of *1*, or *enabled*. The output rows might be in any order, because the sort order isn't guaranteed to match the order of the original string.

## Easily remove prefix and postfix characters using LTRIM, RTRIM and TRIM

The marketing team needs to send some fliers to our customers for our latest holiday sale, but would like to know if any of them are using a P.O. Box. They ask our DBA team to list our customers whose address is a P.O. Box and return the customer name, the postal code, and the number. When you use the new capability of `LTRIM`, `RTRIM`, and `TRIM`, you should be able to easily return the requested data.

```sql
SELECT P.FirstName + ' ' + ISNULL(P.MiddleName,'') + ' ' + P.LastName AS Name
    , LTRIM(A.AddressLine1,'POBoxN.# ') AS POBox
    , PostalCode
FROM AdventureWorks2012.Sales.Customer C
    JOIN AdventureWorks2012.Person.Person P ON P.BusinessEntityID = C.PersonID
    JOIN AdventureWorks2012.Person.BusinessEntityAddress BEA on P.BusinessEntityID = BEA.BusinessEntityID
    JOIN AdventureWorks2012.Person.Address A ON A.AddressID = BEA.AddressID
WHERE LOWER(AddressLine1) like 'p%o%box%'
```

Results:

| Name | POBox | PostalCode |
|---|---|---|
| Chase  Cox | 8070 | 92806 |
| Darren  Prasad | 1052 | 4169 |
| Jordyn N Griffin | 9178 | 98027 |
| Barbara  Xu | 2851 | 4217 |
| Destiny  Jones | 9257 | 4217 |

| Ashlee N Chande| 2513 | 2113 |
| Cedric  Huang | 9257 | 90210 |
| Jeffery J Lin | 4559 | 7001 |
| Douglas  Subram | 8070 | 5023 |
| Stephanie N Young | 2513 | 98312 |
| Alexia  Washington | 1052 | V8P |
| Randy J Zhao | 2162 | 2450 |
| Aidan  Henderson | 5413 | 98168 |

In this example, we used the `LTRIM` function to clean up the P.O. Box by removing the unwanted prefixes, providing the marketing team with the requested data. Notice how the characters included in the search set include all the characters in the possible prefixes we defined.

## GREATEST and LEAST

The `GREATEST` and `LEAST` functions are new to SQL Server 2022, and they return the maximum and minimum values from a list of expressions, respectively.

With the improvements to `LTRIM`, `RTRIM`, `TRIM`, and `STRING_SPLIT` in SQL Server 2022, you can boost your database query abilities. Additionally, the introduction of the `GREATEST` and `LEAST` functions enables more efficient handling and analysis of your data.
