SQL Server 2022 introduces the `WINDOW` clause in `SELECT` statements, making it easier to perform complex window functions and calculations on your data.

## SELECT - WINDOW

The `WINDOW` clause allows you to define a named window specification that can be used with multiple window functions in a query. This feature simplifies complex calculations, such as moving averages and running totals, by allowing you to reuse a single window definition.

## Simplifying aggregations and calculations by using the WINDOWS clause

Imagine you're a database developer working on an e-commerce application. You have table called *SalesOrderHeader*, which contains columns *SalesOrderID* and *OrderDate*. You have a second table called *SalesOrderDetail*, which contains columns for *SalesOrderID*, *ProductID*, *OrderQty*, *UnitPrice* and *LineTotal*. The sales department has asked you to analyze the data for the products *Touring-2000 Blue, 50* and *Touring-3000 Blue, 62* sold on *March 3, 2014*. The team needs:

- The total sales per product.
- A moving average for the last three sales.
- The sum of sales for each product over the last three orders.
- A running total for both products on that date.

Using the `SELECT` statement with the `WINDOW` clause, you can easily achieve this report with a single query. Here's an example of how to do this query:

```sql
SELECT 
    SOH.SalesOrderID,
    P.Name,
    SOD.OrderQty,
    SOD.UnitPrice,
    SOD.LineTotal,
    SUM(SOD.LineTotal) OVER product_sales AS TotalSalesPerProduct,
    AVG(SOD.LineTotal) OVER last_three_sales AS LastThreeSalesAverageByProduct,
    SUM(SOD.LineTotal) OVER last_three_sales AS LastThreeSalesSumByProduct,
    SUM(SOD.LineTotal) OVER running_total AS RunningTotal
FROM [AdventureWorks2012].[Sales].[SalesOrderDetail] SOD
    JOIN [AdventureWorks2012].[Sales].[SalesOrderHeader] SOH on SOD.SalesOrderID = SOH.SalesOrderID
    JOIN [AdventureWorks2012].[Production].[Product] P ON P.ProductID = SOD.ProductID
WHERE P.Name IN ('Touring-2000 Blue, 50', 'Touring-3000 Blue, 62')
    AND SOH.OrderDate = '2014-03-01'
WINDOW 
    -- Partition by product name window.
    product_sales AS (PARTITION BY P.Name),
    -- Last 3 sales by Product name order by date and Sales order ID.
    last_three_sales AS (PARTITION BY P.Name ORDER BY SOH.OrderDate, SOH.SalesOrderID ROWS BETWEEN 2 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW),
    -- The current an all the previous sales window.
    running_total AS (ORDER BY SOH.OrderDate, SOH.SalesOrderID ROWS UNBOUNDED PRECEDING)
```

In this example, we used the `WINDOW` clause to define three named window specifications: *product_sales*, *last_three_sales*, and *running_total*. We reused the *last_three_sales* window specification for calculating both the last three sales moving average and the sum of sales in the last three orders. Using the `WINDOW` clause makes the code more organized and easier to read.

Results:

The `WINDOW` clause in SQL Server 2022 is a valuable addition for data analysts, developers, and database administrators working with SQL Server, because it simplifies complex calculations and aggregations by streamlining the use of window functions in `SELECT` statements.
