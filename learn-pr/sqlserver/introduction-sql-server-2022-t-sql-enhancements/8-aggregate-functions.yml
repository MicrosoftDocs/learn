  title: Knowledge check
  questions:
  - content: "Which SQL Server function should be used to compute the approximate value at a specified percentile without interpolating between data points?"
    choices: 
    - content: "APPROX_PERCENTILE_CONT"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "APPROX_PERCENTILE_CONT interpolates between data points to provide a more accurate estimate."
    - content: "PERCENTILE_DISC"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "PERCENTILE_DISC computes the exact value at a specified percentile without interpolating between data points, but we're looking for the function that gives the approximate value from the existing data point."
    - content: "APPROX_PERCENTILE_DISC"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "APPROX_PERCENTILE_DISC efficiently calculates the nearest existing data point."
  - content: "What is the primary difference between APPROX_PERCENTILE_DISC and APPROX_PERCENTILE_CONT functions?"
    choices:
    - content: "APPROX_PERCENTILE_DISC returns the nearest existing data point, while APPROX_PERCENTILE_CONT interpolates between data points."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "APPROX_PERCENTILE_DISC calculates the approximate value at a given percentile within a dataset, returning the nearest existing data point, while APPROX_PERCENTILE_CONT computes the approximate value at a specified percentile, interpolating between data points if needed."
    - content: "APPROX_PERCENTILE_DISC interpolates between data points, while APPROX_PERCENTILE_CONT returns the nearest existing data point."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The opposite is true, APPROX_PERCENTILE_DISC calculates the approximate value at a given percentile within a dataset, returning the nearest existing data point, while APPROX_PERCENTILE_CONT computes the approximate value at a specified percentile, interpolating between data points if needed."
    - content: "APPROX_PERCENTILE_DISC calculates exact percentiles, while APPROX_PERCENTILE_CONT provides approximate percentiles."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Both APPROX_PERCENTILE_DISC and APPROX_PERCENTILE_CONT functions compute approximate percentiles."
