  title: Knowledge check
  questions:
  - content: "What is the purpose of the JSON_OBJECT function in SQL Server 2022?"
    choices:
    - content: "To check if a JSON string is valid"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The JSON_OBJECT function constructs a JSON object by specifying key-value pairs, simplifying the process of creating JSON objects from query results."
    - content: "To construct a JSON object using key-value pairs"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "The JSON_OBJECT function constructs a JSON object by specifying key-value pairs, making it easier to create JSON objects from query results."
    - content: "To construct a JSON array using elements"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The JSON_ARRAY function constructs a JSON array by specifying elements, not the JSON_OBJECT function."
  - content: "What enhancement was made to the ISJSON function in SQL Server 2022?"
    choices:
    - content: "Support for JSON type constraint"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "In SQL Server 2022, the ISJSON function was enhanced to support json_type_constraint, allowing you to check for the JSON types of VALUE, ARRAY, OBJECT, or SCALAR."
    - content: "Support for JSON path expressions"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The enhancement made to the ISJSON function in SQL Server 2022 was the support for json_type_constraint, not JSON path expressions."
    - content: "Ability to create JSON arrays"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The enhancement made to the ISJSON function in SQL Server 2022 was the support for json_type_constraint. Creating JSON arrays is a feature of the JSON_ARRAY function."
