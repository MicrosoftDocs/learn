  title: Knowledge check
  questions:
  - content: "What is the primary difference between the '=' operator and the 'IS NOT DISTINCT FROM' operator?"
    choices: 
    - content: "There's no difference; they both compare values for equality in the same exact way."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "While both '=' and 'IS NOT DISTINCT FROM' compare values for equality, they handle NULL values differently."
    - content: "`IS NOT DISTINCT FROM` handles `NULL` values in comparisons, while the `=` operator doesn't."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "`IS NOT DISTINCT FROM` compares the equality of two expressions and guarantees a true or false result, even if one or both operands are NULL. The `=` operator returns `UNKNOWN` when one or both expressions are `NULL`."
    - content: "The `=` operator can compare any data type, while `IS NOT DISTINCT FROM` can only compare string values."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Both '=' and 'IS NOT DISTINCT FROM' operators can compare various data types."
  - content: "How does the `IS NOT DISTINCT FROM` predicate treat NULL values in comparisons?"
    choices:
    - content: "As unknown values"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The `IS [NOT] DISTINCT FROM` predicate treats NULL values as known values in comparisons, making it easier to work with NULL values."
    - content: "As known values"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "The `IS [NOT] DISTINCT FROM` predicate treats NULL values as known values in comparisons, making it easier to work with NULL values."
    - content: "As zero values"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The `IS [NOT] DISTINCT FROM` predicate doesn't treat NULL values as zero values, but as known values in comparisons."
