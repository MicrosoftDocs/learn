  questions:
  - content: "In SQL Server 2022, which function is used to select the smallest value among multiple expressions?"
    choices: 
    - content: "MIN_VALUE"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "MIN_VALUE doesn't exist as a function in SQL Server 2022. The correct function to use is MIN, but it's an aggregate function and can't be used for multiple expressions."
    - content: "LEAST"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "LEAST selects the smallest value among multiple expressions."
    - content: "FIRST_VALUE"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "FIRST_VALUE selects the first value in an ordered set of values."
  - content: "What is the purpose of the optional ordinal parameter in the STRING_SPLIT function in SQL Server 2022?"
    choices:
    - content: "It specifies the delimiter to use when splitting the string."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The delimiter is specified as the second parameter of the STRING_SPLIT function. The optional ordinal parameter is used to enable or disable the creation of a 1-based index value of each substring's position in the input string."
    - content: "It enables the creation of a 1-based index value of each substring's position in the input string."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "The optional ordinal parameter in the STRING_SPLIT function allows you to create a 1-based index value of each substring's position in the input string when set to 1 or enabled."
    - content: "It controls the maximum number of substrings to return."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The optional ordinal parameter isn't used for controlling the maximum number of substrings to return. It's used to enable or disable the creation of a 1-based index value of each substring's position in the input string."
