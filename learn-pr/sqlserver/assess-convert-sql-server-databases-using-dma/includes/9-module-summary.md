In your law firm, you had independent offices with their own database systems, such as Customer Relationship Management (CRM) tools, each of which was managed locally. Those databases ran various versions of SQL Server and had become inconsistent. You wanted to standardize these systems on SQL Server 2019 but you wanted to investigate compatibility issues carefully to ease this migration project. You used Microsoft Data Migration Assistant to check for compatibility issues in your databases before the upgrade. You discovered how to use DMA to check for problems without having to install a new instance, or configure Azure. The assistant provides detailed steps for fixing issues and deprecated features. 

A database migration project that involves multiple versions of SQL Server can involve many hours of investigation and problem diagnosis. It's also difficult to be sure that you have considered all compatibility issues and a single missed issue could cause the project to fail. DMA removes such problems by automating and documenting issues before the upgrade. By using DMA you can increase your confidence that the migration will run smoothly.
