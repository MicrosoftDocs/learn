You'll learn about SQL Server 2025 scenarios that can be extended to the cloud and understand the advantages of using a hybrid approach to increase productivity and innovation. You'll explore how to connect to Azure for managing disaster recovery, near real-time analytics, data synchronization, and enhanced authentication.

Understanding how SQL Server operates as a hybrid data platform helps in modernizing your data estate and improving scalability and control. The hybrid data platform also enables you to explore cloud computing benefits before fully migrating to Azure, providing an opportunity to evaluate performance and reliability before a full commitment.

A cloud connected service can also be adopted in different ways, such as storing SQL Server data files on Azure Storage, backing up to S3-compatible storage, or failing over SQL Server to Azure during a disaster recovery or migration scenario.

### Increased agility and innovation

To keep up with technological advancements, services require substantial computing resources due to increasing data volumes. A hybrid approach for your data services provides agility and scalability. Managing and maintaining a disaster recovery site for your data can be difficult and costly. Getting started with business continuity through Azure SQL Managed Instance Link, combined with features like Microsoft Fabric Mirroring for real-time data synchronization, can help ease this burden and support your transition to the cloud.

SQL Server 2025 enhances hybrid capabilities with improved cloud integration options. Features like S3-compatible object storage support for backups, enhanced [Azure Arc](/azure/azure-arc/overview?azure-portal=true) management, and connectivity with [Microsoft Fabric](/fabric/get-started/microsoft-fabric-overview?azure-portal=true) enable organizations to build data platforms that span on-premises and cloud environments.

You'll explore the hybrid services available on SQL Server 2025 that can help you optimize costs for several workloads, avoid unnecessary infrastructure investments, and increase team agility. A hybrid approach can be adopted by organizations with an on-premises legacy setup that is no longer supported by vendors, enabling them to modernize incrementally while maintaining existing investments.

### Security enhancements

A properly secured hybrid cloud infrastructure can provide a safe environment for your services and enhance your overall security framework.

Security solutions should provide visibility and control over the network, and various security options to safeguard hybrid cloud environments. Compliance and governance are important considerations when it comes to security in certain industries like finance, government, and healthcare.

For this reason, it's essential to have a security solution that adheres to industry standards and regulations in hybrid cloud environments to ensure data security, confidentiality, and integrity. 

[Microsoft Entra authentication](/entra/identity/authentication/overview-authentication?azure-portal=true) for SQL Server 2025 is a central authentication repository that supports advanced authentication methods like Microsoft Entra multifactor authentication and Microsoft Entra access tokens, enabling companies to add security to their authentication process. SQL Server 2025 builds upon this foundation with enhanced managed identity support for Azure Arc-enabled instances, providing secure authentication to Azure services.

With a cloud-based central authentication authority like Microsoft Entra ID, you can take advantage of SQL Server security features while reducing the risk of security breaches caused by weak or reused passwords.
