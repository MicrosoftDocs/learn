quiz:
  title: Knowledge check
  questions:
  - content: "What capability do query store hints provide?"
    choices: 
    - content: "An easy-to-use method for shaping query plans without changing application code"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Query store hints allow you to persist a query hint in the Query Store without changing the query text"
    - content: "Change query plans by reverting back to a previous plan found in the Query Store."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Reverting back to a previous plan found in the Query Store is known as Auto Plan Correction."
    - content: "Change query text when persisting a query in the Query Store"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Query store hints don't change the original query text"
  - content: "Parameter Sensitive Plan optimization can help which scenario?"
    choices: 
    - content: "Data is skewed and you use ad-hoc queries with your application."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This feature isn't designed for ad-hoc queries, but for queries in stored procedures or parameterized statements."
    - content: "Scenarios where more than one plan in cache would help with stored procedure performance."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Parameter Sensitive Plan optimization is designed to allow more than one plan to be in cache for scenarios where parameter values are used in stored procedures or for parameterized queries."
    - content: "Scenarios for queries that use parallelism"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This feature might help queries that use parallelism, but doesn't require it. Degree of parallelism feedback is designed to help with queries that use parallelism"
