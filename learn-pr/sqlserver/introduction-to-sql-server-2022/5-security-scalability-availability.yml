  title: Knowledge check
  questions:
  - content: "Ledger for SQL Server provides tamper-evident proof for data integrity using what capability?"
    choices: 
    - content: "Auditing of any T-SQL statement executed against SQL Server"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Ledger for SQL Server doesn't audit all T-SQL statements. You would need to use SQL Server Audit for this requirement."
    - content: "End-to-end encryption of data associated with a database set with the LEDGER option."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Ledger for SQL Server doesn't encrypt data in user tables, and there isn't a database option called LEDGER. Always Encrypted is a feature to encrypt data end-to-end."
    - content: "Built-in auditing and cryptographic hashes of transactions against a ledger table."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Ledger for SQL Server uses auditing and crypto hashes to provide tamper-evident proof for tables declared as ledger tables."
  - content: "Contained availability groups replicate what new types of data in SQL Server 2022 for a normal availability group?"
    choices: 
    - content: "SQL Server Agent Jobs"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Contained availability groups use contained system databases to support replicating of data, for instance, objects like SQL Server Agent Jobs."
    - content: "Windows registry keys for SQL Server"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Contained availability groups don't replicate information in Windows registry keys associated with SQL Server."
    - content: "Changes to rows in user tables"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "While changes to user tables are replicated in availability groups, it isn't new for SQL Server 2022, such as instance level objects for contained availability groups."
