  Answer the following questions to test your knowledge of SQL Server 2025 features.
quiz:
  title: Knowledge check
  questions:
  - content: "Which feature in SQL Server 2025 enables semantic search and similarity matching using vector embeddings?"
    choices:
    - content: "Full-text search"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Full-text search is a traditional text search feature. Vector search is the new feature that enables semantic search and similarity matching."
    - content: "Vector search"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Vector search is a new feature in SQL Server 2025 that enables semantic search and similarity matching using vector embeddings."
    - content: "Regular expressions"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Regular expressions are used for pattern matching in text. Vector search is used for semantic search and similarity matching."
    - content: "Text chunking"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Text chunking is a preprocessing step. Vector search is the feature that enables semantic search functionality."

  - content: "What is the key improvement in Microsoft Fabric mirroring compared to traditional Change Data Capture (CDC)?"
    choices:
    - content: "Uses SQL Server Agent for key functions"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. SQL Server 2025's Change Feed method eliminates the need for SQL Server Agent, unlike CDC."
    - content: "Requires On-premises Data Gateway"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The new Change Feed method uses direct writes to OneLake, with OPDG only for control and command."
    - content: "Uses Change Feed method for direct streaming"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. SQL Server 2025 replaces CDC with the Change Feed method, enabling direct streaming to OneLake with reduced overhead."
    - content: "Requires Arc Agent for authentication"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Arc Agent provides system managed identity but isn't the key improvement over CDC."

  - content: "Which new capability in SQL Server 2025 allows developers to validate and transform text using pattern matching directly in T-SQL?"
    choices:
    - content: "JSON functions"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. JSON functions handle JSON data structure but don't provide pattern matching capabilities."
    - content: "Regular expressions (RegEx)"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Regular expressions in SQL Server 2025 enable pattern matching and text transformation directly in T-SQL."
    - content: "REST APIs"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. REST APIs are for external service integration, not text pattern matching."
    - content: "Vector embeddings"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Vector embeddings are used for semantic search, not text pattern matching."

  - content: "What improvement in Query Store helps monitor performance in high-availability environments?"
    choices:
    - content: "Automatic index recommendations"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While this is a feature, the key improvement for HA environments is performance monitoring on readable secondaries."
    - content: "Plan improvement suggestions"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Plan improvements are a general feature, not specific to high-availability monitoring."
    - content: "Performance monitoring on readable secondaries"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Query Store now supports capturing performance data on readable secondary replicas, which is valuable in high-availability environments."
    - content: "Cross-database query monitoring"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While this is a feature, the specific improvement for HA environments is monitoring on readable secondaries."
