SQL Server 2022 enables rich hybrid data platform capabilities to connect to the Azure cloud for disaster recovery, analytics, and security.

## SQL Server is a hybrid data platform

SQL Server 2022 connects to the cloud with the following Azure services as seen in the following figure:

:::image type="content" source="../media/sql-server-2022-cloud-connected.png" alt-text="Diagram showing cloud connected services for SQL Server 2022.":::

The SQL Server 2022 engine was enhanced to integrate with all of these Azure services, but also can require extra software or configuration:

- Distributed Availability Group - Managed disaster recovery using the Link feature for Azure SQL Managed instance requires setting up a Distributed Availability Group. SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) provides graphical interfaces to help with this configuration.

- Self-hosted integration runtime - The self-hosted integration runtime is a Windows program that must be installed on your network. It should be installed separate from the SQL Server 2022 setup experience, to connect to SQL Server for Azure Synapse Link for SQL Server.

- Azure extension for SQL Server - The Azure extension for SQL Server is used to set up the Azure Arc agents and extensions to enable SQL Server 2022 as an Azure Arc-enabled SQL Server. This extension is required to set up Microsoft Purview, Microsoft Entra authentication, and Microsoft Defender integration with SQL Server 2022.

Let's look at each of these Azure connected scenarios in more detail.

## Managed Disaster Recovery using the Link feature for Azure SQL Managed Instance

The Link feature for Azure SQL Managed Instance provides a new managed disaster recovery solution for SQL Server 2022.

### Challenges with disaster recovery

Having a disaster recovery site and plan are critical to ensuring your business and application are available at any time. While SQL Server has all the features and capabilities to support various disaster recovery options, a user or admin must perform all the configuration, setup, and maintenance.

### Solution using managed disaster recovery in SQL Server 2022

The link feature for Azure SQL Managed Instance allows you to link a SQL Server 2022 database to SQL Managed Instance using built-in Availability Group (AG) technology in SQL Server.

Using documented scripts or graphical wizards with SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS), you can connect an existing AG in SQL Server 2022, or create a new one (no replica required) to create a Distributed Availability Group between SQL Server 2022 and Azure SQL Managed Instance.

Initial data is seeded to create a synchronized database in SQL Managed Instance. Any changes made to the primary SQL Server are reflected in the database in SQL Managed Instance.

A planned or forced failover could then be done, should a disaster scenario arise for the application to then use SQL Managed Instance as the primary. SQL Managed Instance offers a compatibility option so that the instance and database are compatible with SQL Server 2022.

Following these steps would allow for an offline diaster recovery scenario, so that you could restore a copy of the database from SQL Managed Instance *back* to SQL Server 2022.

## Near real-time analytics with Azure Synapse Link for SQL Server

Azure Synapse Link for SQL Server allows you to offload read workloads in Azure Synapse for near real-time analytics.

### Challenges with analytics

Azure Synapse is now a popular service for analytics for data of all types. In addition, many customers are looking to offload their read intensive applications from their primary SQL Server, to ensure the primary application has plenty of resources. To use Azure Synapse for this purpose, you typically have to build Extract Transform Load (ETL) applications, or use scripts to copy data out of SQL Server to synchronize into Azure Synapse. This method can introduce challenges because the data is often out of date in Azure Synapse and it can be costly to build and maintain ETL applications.

### Solution using Azure Synapse Link for near real-time analytics

Azure Synapse Link for SQL Server provides a seamless and tight integration between SQL Server 2022 and Azure Synapse. You can now define a **linked service** for SQL Server in Azure Synapse to set up a connection to SQL Server 2022, including the setup of the self-hosted integration runtime on the network to discover and connect to SQL Server 2022. In addition, you can set up a linked service with an Azure Storage account called the **Landing Zone**.

You can then use Azure Synapse through Azure Synapse Studio or PowerShell to create a **linked connection** using the linked services. This linked connection defines which tables you want to keep synchronized from SQL Server 2022 to Azure Synapse and a **SQL dedicated pool**, which is the target of the data.

When you start the linked connection, Azure Synapse coordinates with the self-hosted integration runtime to start a synchronization with SQL Server using the specified tables to copy parquet files into the Landing Zone. Azure Synapse ingests the parquet files from the Landing Zone to create new tables in a SQL dedicated pool with a snapshot of the SQL Server table data.

When committed transactions are made in SQL Server 2022 for affected tables, the SQL Server engine captures the changes automatically with a process called **change feed**, and place files in the Landing Zone to reflect incremental changes. Azure Synapse picks up these files and makes the necessary changes in near real-time to tables in the SQL dedicated pool.

You can now use the power of Azure Synapse with Power BI, Spark, or other analytics to read SQL Server 2022 data in near real-time offloaded from the primary SQL Server database.

## Central governance with Microsoft Purview

Microsoft Purview provides services for central governance by allowing you to create policies for authentication and authorization to SQL Server 2022.

### Challenges with governance

SQL Server provides a rich system to create logins and users for authentication to connect, and roles and permissions for authorization for specific tasks or access to data. One challenge is to integrate the SQL Server security system with other aspects for an organization's security policies, and also to establish SQL Server security policies across multiple SQL Server instances.

### Solution using Microsoft Purview for central governance

Microsoft Purview allows you to create **access policies** against one or more SQL Server 2022 instances. You must have the proper Azure Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) permissions with a Microsoft Purview account to create access policies. An access policy defines specific permissions for a Microsoft Entra account for a SQL Server instance. Access policies include two different types:

- **Data**: A data access policy allows a Microsoft Entra account to log into SQL Server and have access to **read** data from user tables in any database for the instance.

- **DevOps**: A DevOps access policy allows a Microsoft Entra account to log into SQL Server and perform specific tasks, such as **Performance Monitoring** or **Security Auditing**.

You don't need to create a login or user account for the Microsoft Entra account to apply the access policy. SQL Server 2022 must be configured as an Azure Arc-enabled SQL Server to use Microsoft Purview access policies. The Azure extension for SQL Server stores information on SQL Server. This information allows the database engine to connect to Microsoft Purview to retrieve access policies, cache them inside SQL Server, and apply a policy when a Microsoft Entra account attempts to log into SQL Server.

You can delete the access policy from Microsoft Purview to remove the authentication and authorization of the Microsoft Entra account at any time. You can also apply an access policy across multiple SQL Server 2022 instances, to provide a central governance method.

To learn more about Microsoft Purview access policies for SQL Server 2022, see [Provision access by data owner for SQL Server on Azure Arc-enabled servers](https://aka.ms/purviewsqlaccesspolicies).

## Central authentication using Microsoft Entra ID

Microsoft Entra ID provides a cloud-based central authentication authority for any organization using advanced authentication methods. SQL Server 2022 supports logins or users based on Microsoft Entra accounts.

### Challenges with authentication

SQL Server supports authentication for SQL Server or Windows accounts. Many users are looking to centralize their authentication systems using the cloud, and to support advanced authentication methods, like multifactor authentication (MFA).

### Solution using Microsoft Entra ID for authentication

SQL Server 2022 now supports Microsoft Entra account based logins and users. SQL Server 2022 must be configured as an Azure Arc-enabled SQL Server to use Microsoft Entra authentication. The Azure extension for SQL Server stores information on SQL Server that allows the database engine to authenticate a Microsoft Entra account.

Like Azure SQL Managed Instance and Azure SQL Database, SQL Server 2022 supports a new syntax for `CREATE LOGIN` to support an `EXTERNAL PROVIDER`, which is a Microsoft Entra account (user, group, or service principal). In addition, the `CREATE USER` T-SQL statement supports an `EXTERNAL PROVIDER` with a Microsoft Entra account to provide authentication to users in a database without the need for a login.

One of the benefits of Microsoft Entra is support for advanced authentication methods, such as multifactor authentication. SQL Server 2022 supports the following Microsoft Entra authentication methods:

- Microsoft Entra password
- Microsoft Entra integrated
- Microsoft Entra multifactor authentication (MFA)
- Microsoft Entra access token

## Stay protected with Microsoft Defender for SQL

Microsoft Defender for SQL is a Defender plan in Microsoft Defender for Cloud, and supports Defender for SQL Server on machines, including an Azure Arc-enabled SQL Server.

### Challenges in protecting SQL Server

Ensuring that your SQL Server and data are protected, is critical to any business. Security professionals are always looking to find ways to stay ahead of security threats to SQL Server in a robust and reliable fashion.

### Solutions to protect SQL Server 2022 using Microsoft Defender

Microsoft Defender for SQL provides a reliable and industry-proven method to detect security vulnerabilities, and provide advanced threat protection for SQL Server. You can enable Microsoft Defender for SQL by registering SQL Server 2022 using the Azure extension for SQL Server to make the instance an Azure Arc-enabled SQL Server.

Microsoft Defender for SQL Server provides two main capabilities:

- Vulnerability Assessment
- Advanced Threat Protection

#### Vulnerability Assessment

Microsoft Defender scans your SQL Server configuration and provides recommendations on possible security vulnerabilities based on industry standards, such as CIS and FedRAMP.

#### Advanced Threat Protection

Microsoft Defender monitors possible security threats to your SQL Server instance. It alerts you to threats including SQL injection attacks, suspicious login activity, and brute force attacks, among others.
