SQL Server 2025 introduces deployment, edition, and licensing options that support hybrid, cloud-native, and AI scenarios. This unit explores deployment methods, containerization features, and differences from earlier versions.

## Choose deployment options for SQL Server 2025

SQL Server 2025 expands deployment flexibility, supporting Windows and Linux operating systems, virtual machines, and a wide range of cloud platforms. New in this release are advanced containerization features, improved orchestration for Kubernetes and Azure Arc, and seamless integration with Azure for hybrid and multicloud scenarios.

Key deployment enhancements in SQL Server 2025 include:

- **Enhanced containerization**: Native support for containerized deployments with improved scalability, security, and orchestration using Kubernetes, Azure Arc, and other cloud-native tools.

## Enable preview features

SQL Server 2025 provides a preview feature option to test upcoming capabilities before they become generally available. By enabling this option, you can experiment with innovations like vector indexing, enhanced text chunking, and change event streamingâ€”without affecting your production workloads. This approach gives you the flexibility to test and evaluate new features in a safe, isolated way, bringing agility to your on-premises environment.

Unlike traditional trace flags, which are mainly for debugging and affect the whole server, the preview feature switch is set at the database level. This means you can enable preview features for specific databases, allowing targeted experimentation while keeping the rest of your environment stable. Preview features are intended for evaluation and shouldn't be used in production, but the core database remains fully supported and stable even when preview features are enabled.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Preview features are not intended for production environments and may change before final release. Use them only in development or test environments.
