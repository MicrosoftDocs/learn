    choices:
    - content: Transaction Processing
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: While a nonclustered columnstore index can be used here, rowstore indexes may better suit this use case.
    - content: Image Storage
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Columnstore indexes wouldn't help with the storage of binary data or data kept on the file system.
