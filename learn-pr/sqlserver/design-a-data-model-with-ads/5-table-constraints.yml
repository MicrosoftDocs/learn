  title: Check your knowledge

  questions:
  - content: A foreign key reference what type of column in another table?
    choices:
    - content: A column that can have nulls
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Foreign keys reference primary keys, which can't have nulls.
    - content: A column that is also a foreign key
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Foreign keys can't reference other foreign keys. They can only reference primary keys.
    - content: A column that is a primary key
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Foreign keys create a link, or reference, back to another table's primary key ensuring data continuity.

  - content: What type of constraint would you use to limit the values that are accepted by one or more columns in a table to a specified range using logical expressions?
    choices:
    - content: Check
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Check constraints can help limit values entered using logical expressions that return TRUE or FALSE.
    - content: Unique
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Unique constraints would be used to ensure no duplicate values are entered into a column.
    - content: Foreign keys
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Foreign keys are used to establish and enforce a link between the data in two tables. While a foreign key does restrict what data can be entered, it isn't using logical expressions.
