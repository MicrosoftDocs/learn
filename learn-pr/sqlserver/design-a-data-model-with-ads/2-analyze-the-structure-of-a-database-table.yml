  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:

  - content: A global application requires times to be stored with timezone information. Which data type would be used?
    choices:
    - content: datatime2
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: While datatime2 is a data type that gives the database the ability to store a date to the fraction of a second, it doesn't contain timezone information.
    - content: datetimeoffset
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: The datetimeoffset data type does give the Azure SQL Database the ability to store timezone information in the format YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss[.nnnnnnn] [+|-]hh:mm
    - content: nvarchar
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: While you could store timezone information in a nvarchar data type, you would have to create functions to convert dates to strings and strings to date and isn't the best choice.

  - content: How large are the page files that store table data?
    choices:
    - content: 8 bits (b)
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: A bit is the basic unit of storage for computing and would require 64,000 files to be the same as a single 8 kilobyte (KB) file.
    - content: 8 Kilobytes (KB)
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct and remember extents hold eight contiguous pages
    - content: 8 Megabytes (MB)
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: An extent holds eight contiguous pages and there are 16 extents per megabyte so 8 megabytes is too large.
