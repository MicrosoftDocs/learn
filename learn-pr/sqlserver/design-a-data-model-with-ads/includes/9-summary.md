You were tasked to create a data model for a card game's web-based reference application. By learning some of the core concepts for tables in Azure SQL, you were able to:

* Add primary keys and identity columns to the tables.
* Create indexes for faster query performance.
* Relate tables with foreign keys to reduce duplicate rows and store data efficiently.
* Dictate column data types and if they can be null, have default values, or only contain specific values.
* Work with the data model to see how table relations and constraints are utilized.

Without these concepts, the data model would contain duplicate rows and potentially inaccurate data, and query time would affect the user experience. By thinking about how data will be accessed and stored, you can create a data model that scales with the business needs and grows with customer demands using the basic table concepts you've learned in this module.
