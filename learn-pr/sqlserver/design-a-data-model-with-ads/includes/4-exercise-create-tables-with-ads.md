It's time to create the tables that will hold the data for your online card-reference application. Use the following image to visualize what the data model could look like.

![Picture of a sample data model consisting of four tables.](../media/model-1s.png)

In this exercise, you'll create the data model for your online card-reference application.

## What tables are needed?

The online card-reference application isn't only going to have to hold information about individual cards, but translations in different languages for each card and what set or release each card is in. Because of these requirements, you'll be creating a data model with four tables: a cards table to hold information about each card, a card-translations table, a sets table to hold set name and release date, and a table that matches cards to a set. Each set can contain cards from older sets as well as new cards, so you need to have a table that can match up a card to a set.

## Create the cards table

First, create the cards table. There are some rules to which the card game has to adhere, and they need to be reflected in your table design:

- Only one row for each card in the cards table
- A card can have multiple language translations of the original text and card name
- The cards attributes are:
  - Card ID (a number)
  - Name (no more than 100 characters)
  - Color (no more than 10 characters)
  - Power (no card can have a power greater than 20)
  - Type (no more than 10 characters)
  - Text (Text area is 500 characters large)
  - Status
  - Art
- A card can only be one of the following colors: **black, blue, green, red, white, orange**
- A card can only be one of the following types: **hero, monster, spell, weapon**

With these rules, you can draft a table to hold the card information. Let's start with the initial eight fields and assign data types based on what needs to be stored.

Let's start with card ID. The rules dictate that it'll be a number, so an integer data type is appropriate here. Name, type, and color are all text-based, so you can use `nvarchar` as the data type, then provide a length from the guidance in the preceding card rules. Card power can have a value between 0 and 20, so it can use a `tinyint` data type. Card text is a text area no larger than 500 characters, so just like name, type, and color, you can use `nvarchar`. Card status tells us if the card is still being used or has been retired; a yes or no answer. Using a `bit` data type for a true/false answer (boolean) using a 1 or 0 will provide the application what it needs and take up as little space in storage as possible. Lastly, images will be stored for the card art, so `varbinary` is the data type you need.

The following table outline is a summary of what we discussed in the previous paragraph:

### Cards

| Column name | Data type |
|---|---|
| card_id | int  |
| card_name | nvarchar(100) |
| card_type | nvarchar(10) |
| card_color | nvarchar(10) |
| card_power | tinyint |
| card_text | nvarchar(500) |
| card_status | bit |
| card_art | varbinary(max) |

#### Create the cards table in Azure Data Studio

1. In Azure Data Studio, navigate to the **Connections tab**.

    ![Screenshot of the connections tab in Azure Data Studio.](../media/ads-1.png)

1. Expand the database server directory to find the **Tables** folder.

    ![Screenshot of the Azure Data Studio interface showing how to locate the Tables folder in a server connection.](../media/ads-2.png)

1. Right-click the **Tables** folder and select **New Table**, which will open up a new Table Designer view.

    ![Screenshot showing how to right-click the Tables folder and select New Table.](../media/new-table-1.png)

1. Change the **Table name** field from its provided default of **NewTable** to **cards**.

    ![Screenshot of changing the Table name field from it's provided default of NewTable to cards.](../media/ads-3.png)

1. Next, select the **Publish Changes** icon, which is located in the upper left-hand corner of the Table Designer to save and publish this table to your database.

    ![Screenshot showing how to select the Publish Changes icon in the upper left-hand corner of the Table Designer, just above the Table name field.](../media/ads-4.png)

    You'll see the **Preview Database Updates** dialog box appears to confirm the updates to your database. Select **Update Database** to confirm and publish these updates.

    ![Screenshot showing how to select Update Database to confirm.](../media/ads-5.png)

    > [!NOTE]
    > Be sure to confirm that this table is in the **Tables** folder. Right-click the **Tables** folder in your database drop-down in your server connection and select **Refresh**. You should now see your table populated in the drop-down.

    ![Screenshot of the Table Designer in Azure Data Studio showing how to change the name of the table and publish this table to a database.](../media/ads-6.png)

1. Now, you need to add columns and data types to the **cards** table. The first column you're going to add is **card_id** which has a data type of **int**. Use the default column that was added when you created the table and change the name from **column_1** to **card_id**.

    Your card_id column structure should look like the following image, with the name set to card_id:

    ![Screenshot showing the card_id column structure.](../media/new-table-2.png)

1. Add a new column to this table by selecting the **+ New Column** button.

    ![Screenshot of the + New Column button.](../media/new-table-3.png)

1. In the **Name Column** grid of the Table Designer, change the provided default value from **column_1** to **card_name**. In the **Type** field, select the drop-down arrow and select the **nvarchar(50)** data type.

    ![A screenshot of showing how to set the card_name column attributes.](../media/new-table-4.png)

    In the **Column Properties** area, change the **Length** from 50 to 100.

    ![Screenshot showing how to change the Length from 50 to 100.](../media/new-table-5.png)

1. Use the **+ New Column** button to add another new column named **card_type** and give it a data type value of **nvarchar(50)**.

    ![Screenshot showing how to edit the card_type column attributes.](../media/new-table-6.png)

    In the **Column Properties** area, change the **Length** from 50 to 10.

    ![Screenshot showing how to change the Length from 50 to 10.](../media/new-table-6a.png)

1. Again, use the **+ New Column** button to add another new column named **card_color** and give it a data type value of **nvarchar(50)**. As you did with the **card_name** and **card_type** columns, use the **Column Properties** area to change the **Length** from 50 to 10.

    ![Screenshot showing how to create the card_color column.](../media/new-table-10.png)

1. Select the **+ New Column** button to add another new column named **card_power** to the table. In the **Type** dropdown, select the **tinyint** data type.

    ![Screenshot showing how to create the card_power column.](../media/new-table-13.png)

1. Using the **+ New Column** button, add another new column named **card_text** to the table. In the **Type** dropdown, select the **nvarchar(50)** data type. Again, use the **Column Properties** area to change the **Length** from 50 to 500.

    ![Screenshot showing how to create the card_text column.](../media/new-table-14.png)

1. Add another column named **card_status** to the table by using the **+ New Column** button. In the **Type** dropdown, select the **bit** data type.

    ![Screenshot showing how to create the card_status column.](../media/new-table-15.png)

1. Add the final column named **card_art** to the table by using the **+ New Column** button. In the **Type** dropdown, select the **varbinary(MAX)** data type.

    ![Screenshot showing how to create the card_art column.](../media/new-table-16.png)

    The **cards** table is now complete and should look like the following:

    ![A screenshot of the completed cards table design in Azure Data Studio.](../media/ads-finished-cards-table.png)

1. Select the **Publish Changes** button on the top-left of the table designer window to save these table changes to the database.

    ![Screenshot showing how to click the Publish Changes button, located just above the table name field.](../media/new-table-17.png)

    If you're prompted to review the changes, select the **Update Database** button.

    ![Screenshot showing how to click the Update Database button to submit the changed to the cards table to the database.](../media/new-table-18.png)

1. Select the **X** on the **table designer tab** in Azure Data Studio when done to close the window.

    ![Screenshot showing how to click the X on the table designer tab to close the table designer for the cards table](../media/close-tab-1.png)

## Create the translations table

The next table you have to create is the card translations table. This table will contain the card ID and card text translations in multiple languages.

The first column will be the **translations_id** column, which will be an `int` data type. Following that is the **card_id** column. In the previous table, card_id was an `int`, and it'll be the same here. The next column will track what language the translation is in. We'll call it **card_language** and set it to a `nvarchar` of length 50. The final two columns are the **translated_name** and **translated_text** columns. You'll be *increasing* the lengths from the card table, because languages like Japanese or Chinese have more complex characters, thus requiring more space in the database. For example, in English, an *O* will take up one byte. In Japanese, „ÅÜ, which is pronounced as 'oo' like in pool, will take up to four bytes.  

With the translation rules in mind, here's how you can create the translations table:

### Card_translations

| Column name | Data type |
|---|---|
| translation_id | int |
| card_id | int |
| translation_card_language | nvarchar(50) |
| translation_card_name | nvarchar(500) |
| translation_card_text | nvarchar(2000) |

#### Create the translations table in Azure Data Studio

1. Right-click the **Tables** folder and select **New Table**, which opens up a new Table Designer view.

    ![Screenshot showing how to right-click on the Tables folder and select New Table to create the card_translations table.](../media/new-table-1.png)

1. Change the **Table name** field from its provided default of **NewTable** to **card_translations**.

    ![Screenshot showing how to change the Table name field from its provided default of NewTable to card_translations.](../media/translate-1.png)

1. Next, select the **Publish Changes** icon in the upper left-hand corner of the Table Designer to save and publish this table to your database.

    ![Screenshot showing how to select the Publish Changes icon in the upper left-hand corner of the Table Designer, just above the table name field.](../media/translate-2.png)

    You'll see the **Preview Database Updates** dialog box appears to confirm the updates to your database. Select **Update Database** to confirm and publish the updates.

1. Our first column will be named **translation_id** with a data type of **int**. Use the default column that was added when you created the table and change the name from **column_1** to **translation_id** and ensure that the data type is **int**.

    ![A screenshot showing how to use the default made column and name it translation_id with a data type of int.](../media/translate-3.png)

1. Add a new column using the **+ New Column** button and name the column **card_id** with a data type of **int**.

    ![Screenshot showing how to add a new column to the card_translations table using the + New Column button and name the column card_id with a data type of int.](../media/translate-4.png)

1. Again, add a new column using the **+ New Column** button. Name the column **translation_card_language** of type **nvarchar(50)**.

    ![Screenshot showing how to add a new column to the card_translations table using the + New Column button and name the column translation_card_language with a data type of nvarchar(50).](../media/translate-5.png)

1. Add a new column with the **+ New Column** button and name it **translation_card_name** with the **nvarchar(50)** data type. In the **Column Properties** area, change the **Length** from 50 to 500.

    ![A screenshot showing how to add a new column to the card_translations table using the +New Column button and name the column translation_card_name with a data type of nvarchar(50).](../media/translate-6.png)

1. Add the last column with the **+ New Column** button. Name this column **translation_card_text** and select the **nvarchar(50)** data type. Again, use the **Column Properties** area to change the **Length** from 50 to 2000.

    ![A screenshot showing how to add a new column to the card_translations table using the +New Column button and name the column translation_card_text with a data type of nvarchar(2000).](../media/translate-7.png)

    Once you've added all the columns, the card_translations table should look like the following image:

    ![Screenshot showing the card_translations table outline.](../media/translate-9.png)

1. Select the **Publish Changes** button on the top left of the table designer window to save these table changes to the database.

    ![Screenshot showing how to click the Publish Changes button, which is just above the table name field.](../media/translate-8.png)

    If you're prompted to review the changes, select the **Update Database** button.

1. Select the **X** on the **table designer tab** in Azure Data Studio to close the window.

    ![Screenshot showing how to click the X on the table designer tab to close the table designer for the card_translations table.](../media/close-tab-2.png)

## Create the sets table

The card game will have sets released five times a year, so you need to track the set name and the release date. The sets table is a simple table, but it'll be important when you need to add cards to each individual set. The first column will be named **set_id**and be an `int` data type. Next, a name is needed for each set, so **set_name** will be the next column, and will have an `nvarchar` data type with a length of 50. The last column in this small but important table is the **set_date**. It only needs to track day/month/year, so a `date` data type will work here.

Here's what the sets table will look like:

### Sets

| Column name | Data type |
|---|---|
| set_id | int |
| set_name | nvarchar(50) |
| set_date | date |

#### Create the sets table in Azure Data Studio

1. Right-click the **Tables** folder and select **New Table** which will open up a new Table Designer view.

    ![Screenshot showing how to right-click the Tables folder and select New Table to create the sets table.](../media/new-table-1.png)

1. Change the **Table name** field from its provided default of **NewTable** to **sets**.

    ![Screenshot showing how to change the Table name field from its provided default of NewTable to sets.](../media/sets-1.png)

1. Next, select the **Publish Changes** icon located in the upper left-hand corner of the Table Designer to save and publish this table to your database.

    ![Screenshot showing how to select the Publish Changes icon located in the upper left-hand corner of the Table Designer, just above the table name field.](../media/sets-2.png)

    You'll see the **Preview Database Updates** dialog box appears to confirm the updates to your database. Select **Update Database** to confirm and publish these updates.

1. Out first column will be named **set_id** with a data type of `int`. Use the default column that was added when you created the table and change the name from **column_1** to **set_id** and ensure that the data type is **int**.

    ![Screenshot showing how to use the default made column and name it set_id with a data type of int.](../media/sets-3.png)

1. Add a new column using the **+ New Column** button and name the column **set_name** with a data type of **nvarchar(50)**.

    ![Screenshot showing how to add a new column using the + New Column button and name the column set_name with a data type of nvarchar(50).](../media/sets-4.png)

1. Add the last new column using the **+ New Column** button. Name the column **set_date** and set the data type to **date**.

    ![Screenshot showing how to add a new column using the + New Column button and name the column set_date with a data type of date.](../media/sets-5.png)

    The final **sets** table should look like the following image:

    ![Screenshot of the final sets table in Azure Data Studio.](../media/sets-6.png)

1. Select the **Publish Changes** button on the top-left of the table designer window to save these table changes to the database.

    ![Screenshot showing how to click the Publish Changes button just above the table name field.](../media/sets-7.png)

    If prompted to review the changes, select the **Update Database** button.

1. Select the **X** on the **table designer tab** in Azure Data Studio to close the window.

    ![Screenshot showing how to click the X on the table designer tab to close the table designer for the sets table.](../media/close-tab-3.png)

## Create the set_lists table

The last table will tie the cards table and the set table together. When a set releases, it contains a subset of cards from the cards table. For example, if you have cards 1 through 20, a set might contain cards 1 through 10. Another set might contain cards 5 through 8, then 10 through 20.

The columns you'll need start with a **set_list_id** column of data type `int`. Next, you'll need a **card_id** column of data type `int`, as seen in the **cards** and **card_translations** tables. Finally, you'll need a **set_id** column of data type `int`, as in the **sets** table.

The set_lists table will look like the following table outline:

### Set_lists

| Column name | Data type |
|---|---|
| set_list_id | int |
| card_id | int |
| set_id | int |

#### Create the set_lists table in Azure Data Studio

1. Right-click the **Tables** folder and select **New Table**, which opens up a new Table Designer view.

    ![A screenshot showing how to right-click on the Tables folder and select New Table to create the set_lists table.](../media/new-table-1.png)

1. Change the **Table name** field from its provided default of **NewTable** to **set_lists**.

    ![Screenshot showing how to change the Table name field from its provided default of NewTable to set_lists.](../media/lists-1.png)

1. Next, select the **Publish Changes** icon located in the upper left-hand corner of the Table Designer to save and publish this table to your database.

    ![Screenshot showing how to select the Publish changes icon which is located in the upper left hand corner of the Table Designer.](../media/lists-2.png)

    You'll see the **Preview Database Updates** dialog box appears to confirm the updates to your database. Select **Update Database** to confirm and publish these updates.

1. Our first column will be named **set_list_id** and will have a data type of `int`. Use the default column that was added when you created the table and change the name from **column_1** to **set_list_id** and ensure that the data type is **int**.

    ![Screenshot showing how to use the default column and name it set_list_id with a data type of int.](../media/lists-3.png)

1. Add a new column using the **+ New Column** button, name the column **card_id**, and set the data type to **int**.

    ![Screenshot showing how to add a new column using the + New Column button and name the column card_id with a data type of int.](../media/lists-4.png)

1. Add the last new column using the **+New Column** button. Name the column **set_id** and set the data type to **int**.

    ![Screenshot showing how to add a new column using the + New Column button and name the column set_id with a data type of int.](../media/lists-5.png)

    The final **sets** table should look like the following:

    ![Screenshot of the final set_lists table in Azure Data Studio.](../media/lists-6.png)

1. Select the **Publish Changes** button on the top left of the table designer window to save these table changes to the database.
