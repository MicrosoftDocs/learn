  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "You have product catalog data in SAP HANA and sales data in SQL Server running on Linux. You want to write a report that uses data from both systems to analyze profit margins for all products, but you want to minimize the amount work required for database administrators. What should you do?"
    choices:
    - content: "Set up a data warehouse and use ETL packages in SQL Integration Services to populate it with data from SAP HANA and SQL Server. Write the report against the data warehouse."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This solution is possible, but requires significant database administrator time to create the ETL packages and populate the data warehouse."
    - content: "Install PolyBase on the SQL Server and add SAP HANA as an external data source. Create external data tables that connect to the tables in SAP HANA. Write the report against the SQL Server."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "By using PolyBase data virtualization, you can present SAP HANA data in SQL Server as external tables. You can write reports that query both catalog data and sales data from SQL Server, even though the catalog is stored in SAP HANA. There's no need to develop custom code or ETL packages."
    - content: "Write separate queries to obtain the data you need from SQL Server and SAP HANA, then write custom code that integrates the two datasets into a unified report."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This solution is possible, but requires significant database administrator and developer time to create the custom integration code."
  - content: "You have a mobile app written in Python that your sales team uses to record orders and view sales performance data. Recently, you migrated the database from a Windows server to an Ubuntu Linux server. What changes does this migration require in your app code?"
    choices:
    - content: "You must rewrite the app in a .NET Framework language, such as VB.NET or C#."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "It's not necessary to use a .NET language in apps that call SQL Server. Any app code that queries SQL Server databases hosted on Windows can query SQL Server databases hosted on Linux, because the Database Engine is the same."
    - content: "You must rewrite the app to ensure that it doesn't call any stored procedures."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "You can call stored procedures in your app, regardless of whether the app is hosted on Windows or Linux, because the Database Engine is the same."
    - content: "You don't need to make any changes to the app code."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "The SQL platform abstraction layer (SQLPAL) means that the Database Engine is exactly the same, whether SQL Server is running on Windows or on Linux. That means that developers don't have to make any code changes when they migrate a database server to another operating system. They only need to modify the connection string."
