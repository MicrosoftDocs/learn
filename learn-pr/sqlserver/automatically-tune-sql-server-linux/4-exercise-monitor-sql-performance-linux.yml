quiz:
  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "You want to record telemetry about the performance of query plans. Which technology should you enable?"
    choices:
    - content: "Automatic Tuning"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Automatic tuning uses the data in query store to automatically recover from query plan regressions. If you only want to record telemetry, query store is the right technology."
    - content: "Query Store"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Query store records telemetry about queries, query plans, and performance."
    - content: "Query Optimizer"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Query optimizer always runs and creates and compiles the best query plans. To store telemetry about performance, use query store."
  - content: "When you attempted to enable automatic tuning an error occurred. What should you do to resolve this error?"
    choices:
    - content: "Enable query store."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Automatic tuning requires query store to be enabled."
    - content: "Add RAM to the server."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Automatic tuning does not place extra demands on server memory, however it does require query store to be enabled."
    - content: "Run the query optimizer."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Query optimizer runs anyway and would not resolve this problem. Automatic tuning requires query store to be enabled."
