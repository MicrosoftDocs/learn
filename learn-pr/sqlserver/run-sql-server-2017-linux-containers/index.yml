title: Run SQL Server 2019 on Linux containers
summary: |
 Containers provide isolated virtual environments in which you can run applications such as SQL Server 2019 
 and are growing in popularity because of their scalability. If you choose SQL Server 2019 to host your 
 databases, you can run that system in one or more containers based on either Linux or Windows. You can 
 create a container from an image that has SQL Server pre-installed or create your own customized image. 
 In this module, you will see how to run SQL Server 2019 in Linux containers and host a custom database 
 application.
