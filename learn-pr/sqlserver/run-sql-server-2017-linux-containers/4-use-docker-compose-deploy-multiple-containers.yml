quiz:
  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "You want to create a new container image based on the SQL Server on Linux image. You're using Docker to host your containers. Which directive should you use in the Dockerfile to specify this parent?"
    choices:
    - content: "The COPY directive"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The COPY directive copies a file into the image. To specify the parent image, use the FROM directive."
    - content: "The FROM directive"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "The FROM directive is used to specify the parent image in the Dockerfile."
    - content: "The ENV directive"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The ENV directive sets an environment variable for the new image. To specify the parent image, use the FROM directive."
  - content: "You include this line in a Dockerfile: '#CMD [/opt/mssql/bin/sqlservr]'. When you build the image, SQL Server is not run. What must you do to fix the problem?"
    choices:
    - content: "Use #RUN instead of #CMD."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "CMD is the correct directive, but the '#' makes the line a comment and Docker ignores it."
    - content: "Use CMD instead of #CMD."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "CMD is the correct directive, but the '#' makes the line a comment and Docker ignores it."
    - content: "Use #ENV instead of #CMD."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "CMD is the correct directive, but the '#' makes the line a comment and Docker ignores it."
